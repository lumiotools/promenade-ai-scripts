We are optimistic about seeing improvement going forward as changes in the rate environment and easing from the Federal Reserve have allowed us to relieve pressure on our funding costs.” \n\n“Loan growth picked up slightly in the third quarter and overall asset quality remains strong. Our pipelines for both loans and deposits remain strong and our team has done a fantastic job of continuing to grow and build customer relationships.” \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n  * Total assets were $3.07 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $57.2 million from June 30, 2024. \n  * Total loans, including loans held for sale, were at $1.91 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $8.1 million from the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  * Total deposits were $2.52 billion and $2.46 billion at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of $64.7 million. Savings and money market deposits increased $13.5 million and time deposits increased $67.3 million which were partially offset by a decrease in interest bearing demand deposits of $18.3 million from June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024. \n  * Total borrowings at September 30, 2024 totaled $248.0 million, a decrease of $20.0 million or, 7.5%, compared to June 30, 2024, related to decreases in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. \n\n\n\n**Capital**\n\n  * Colony continues to maintain a strong capital position, with ratios that exceed regulatory minimums required to be considered as “well-capitalized.” \n  * Under the Company’s approved stock repurchase program, a total of 35,000 shares of Company common stock were repurchased during the third quarter of 2024 at an average price of $15.02 per share and a total value of $525,817 thousand. \n  * Preliminary tier one leverage ratio, tier one capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio and common equity tier one capital ratio were 9.51%, 13.66%, 16.48%, and 12.51%, respectively, at September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter and September 30, 2024 Year to Date Results of Operations**\n\n  * Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, totaled $18.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to $19.8 million for the same period in 2023. Net interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $56.1 million, compared to $59.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For both periods, increases can be seen in income on interest earning assets which is more than offset by increases in expenses on interest bearing liabilities due to the significant rise in interest rates period over period along with increases in FHLB advances. Income on interest earning assets increased $2.0 million, to $34.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Expense on interest bearing liabilities increased $3.1 million, to $16.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Income on interest earning assets increased $9.5 million to $101.8 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Expense on interest bearing liabilities increased $13.3 million, to $45.6 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. \n  * Net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 2.64% compared to 2.78% for the third quarter of 2023. Net interest margin was 2.67% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.87% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease for both periods is the result of rate increases in interest bearing liabilities outpacing the rate increases in interest earning assets. \n  * Noninterest income totaled $10.1 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $364,000, or 3.75%, compared to the same period in 2023. Noninterest income totaled $29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.7 million, or 10.39%, compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were primarily related to increases in service charges on deposit accounts, gains on sales of SBA loans and income on merchant and wealth advisory services which is included in other noninterest income, which were partially offset by decreases in interchange fee income and losses on the sales of investment securities. \n  * Noninterest expense totaled $20.8 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $20.9 million for the same period in 2023. Noninterest expense totaled $61.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $63.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to decreases in loan related expenses and miscellaneous other losses. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a result of the decrease in salaries and employee benefits primarily related to the expense initiative in 2023 which lowered total number of employees period over period. \n\n\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\n  * Nonperforming assets totaled $12.5 million and $7.3 million at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, an increase of $5.2 million. \n  * Other real estate owned and repossessed assets totaled $236,000 at September 30, 2024 and $595,000 at June 30, 2024. \n  * Net loans charged-off were $139,000, or 0.03% of average loans for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $667,000 or 0.14% for the second quarter of 2024. \n  * The credit loss reserve was $19.7 million, or 1.04% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $18.8 million, or 1.01% of total loans at June 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Earnings call information**\n\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call at 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, October 24, 2024, to discuss the recent results and answer appropriate questions.

The most comparable GAAP measures are noninterest income, noninterest expense, net income, diluted earnings per share, return on average assets, return on average equity, book value per common share, total equity to total assets, efficiency ratio, net noninterest expense to average assets and net interest income before provision for credit losses, respectively. Operating noninterest income excludes gain on sale of bank premises and loss on sales of securities. Operating noninterest expense excludes acquisition-related expenses and severance costs. Operating net income, operating return on average assets, operating return on average equity and operating efficiency ratio all exclude acquisition-related expenses, severance costs, gain on sale of bank premises and loss on sales of securities from net income, return on average assets, return on average equity and efficiency ratio, respectively. Operating net noninterest expense to average assets ratio excludes from net noninterest expense, severance costs, acquisition-related expenses, gain on sale of bank premises and loss on sales of securities. Acquisition-related expenses includes fees associated with acquisitions and vendor contract buyouts. Severance costs includes costs associated with termination and retirement of employees. Adjusted earnings per diluted share includes the adjustments to operating net income. Tangible book value per common share and tangible equity to tangible assets exclude goodwill and other intangibles from book value per common share and total equity to total assets, respectively. Pre-provision net revenue is calculated by adding noninterest income to net interest income before provision for credit losses, and subtracting noninterest expense. \n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company's performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer understanding of the Company's performance, and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors' understanding of the Company's business and performance. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. \n\nThese disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. The computations of operating noninterest income, operating noninterest expense, operating net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, operating return on average assets, operating return on average equity, tangible book value per common share, tangible equity to tangible assets, operating efficiency ratio, operating net noninterest expense to average assets and pre-provision net revenue and the reconciliation of these measures to noninterest income, noninterest expense, net income, diluted earnings per share, return on average assets, return on average equity, book value per common share, total equity to total assets, efficiency ratio, net noninterest expense to average assets and net interest income before provision for credit losses are set forth in the table below. \n\nThese disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.

and the reconciliation of these measures to noninterest income, noninterest expense, net income, diluted earnings per share, return on average assets, return on average equity, book value per common share, total equity to total assets, efficiency ratio, net noninterest expense to average assets and net interest income before provision for credit losses are set forth in the table below.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “strive,” “projection,” “goal,” “target,” “outlook,” “aim,” “would,” “annualized” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. \n\nA number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report and the following:\n\n•the impact of current and future economic and market conditions generally (including seasonality) and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our primary market areas, including the effects of inflationary pressures, changes in interest rates, slowdowns in economic growth, and the potential for high unemployment rates, as well as the financial stress on borrowers and changes to customer and client behavior (including the velocity of loan repayment) and credit risk as a result of the foregoing;\n\n•changes in the interest rate environment (including changes to the federal funds rate, the level and composition of deposits (as well as the cost of, and competition for, deposits), loan demand, liquidity and the values of loan collateral, securities and market fluctuations, and interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities), and competition in our markets may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing our margins and net interest income; \n\n•our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, including our ability to generate liquidity internally or raise capital on favorable terms, including continued access to the debt and equity capital markets; \n\n•the risk that a future economic downturn and contraction, including a recession, could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including the risk that the strength of the current economic environment could be weakened by the impact of rising or elevated interest rates and persistent inflation;\n\n•factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health and credit quality of our borrowers and the success of various projects that we finance;\n\n•concentration of our loan portfolio in real estate loans and changes in the prices, values and sales volumes of commercial and residential real estate;\n\n•weakness in the real estate market, which can affect, among other things, the value of collateral securing mortgage loans, mortgage loan originations and delinquencies, and mortgage fee income; \n\n•credit and lending risks associated with our construction and development, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and residential real estate loan portfolios;\n\n•factors that negatively impact our mortgage banking services, including declines in our mortgage originations or profitability due to rising or elevated interest rates and increased competition and regulation, the Bank’s or third party’s failure to satisfy mortgage servicing obligations, loan modifications, the effects of judicial or regulatory requirements or guidance, and the possibility of the Bank being required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers; \n\n4\n\n•our ability to attract sufficient loans that meet prudent credit standards, including in our construction and development, commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan categories;\n\n•our ability to attract and maintain business banking relationships with well-qualified businesses, real estate developers and investors with proven track records in our market areas;\n\n•our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\"), including the implementation of the Current Expected Credit Losses (\"CECL\") model;\n\n•the adequacy of our reserves (including ACL) and the appropriateness of our methodology for calculating such reserves;\n\n•adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures and the impact of such developments on customer confidence, liquidity and regulatory responses to these developments (including increases in the cost of our deposit insurance assessments and increased regulatory scrutiny), our ability to effectively manage our liquidity risk and any growth plans and the availability of capital and funding;\n\n•our ability to successfully execute our business strategy to achieve profitable growth;\n\n•the concentration of our business within our geographic areas of operation in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and neighboring markets;\n\n•our focus on small and mid-sized businesses;\n\n•our ability to manage our growth;\n\n•our ability to increase our operating efficiency;\n\n•significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets and the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment securities; \n\n•risks that our cost of funding could increase, in the event we are unable to continue to attract stable, low-cost deposits and reduce our cost of deposits;\n\n•inability of our risk management framework to effectively mitigate credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, compliance risk, operational risk (including by virtue of our relationships with third party business partners, as well as our relationships with third party vendors and other service providers), strategic risk, reputational risk and other risks inherent to the business of banking;\n\n•our ability to maintain expenses in line with current projections; \n\n•the makeup of our asset mix and investments;\n\n•external economic, political and/or market factors, such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations, inflation or deflation, changes in the demand for loans, and fluctuations in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition;\n\n•continued or increasing competition from other financial institutions (including fintech companies), credit unions, and non-bank financial services companies, many of which are subject to different regulations than we are;\n\n•challenges arising from unsuccessful attempts to expand into new geographic markets, products, or services;\n\n•restraints on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us, which could limit our liquidity;\n\n•increased capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all;\n\n•a failure in the internal controls we have implemented to address the risks inherent to the business of banking;\n\n•inaccuracies in our assumptions about future events, which could result in material differences between our financial projections and actual financial performance;\n\n•changes in our management personnel or our inability to retain motivate and hire qualified management personnel;\n\n•the dependence of our operating model on our ability to attract and retain experienced and talented bankers in each of our markets, which may be impacted as a result of labor shortages;\n\n•our ability to prevent, identify and address cyber-security risks, fraud and systems errors;\n\n•disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems, and the cost of defending against them and any reputational or other financial risks following such a cybersecurity incident;\n\n•our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and disruptions in service, security breaches, financial difficulties with or other adverse events affecting a third-party vendor or business relationship;\n\n•an inability to keep pace with the rate of technological advances due to a lack of resources to invest in new technologies;\n\n•fraudulent and negligent acts by our clients, employees or vendors and our ability to identify and address such acts;\n\n•risks related to potential acquisitions, including the risk that the regulatory environment may not be conducive to or may prohibit the consummation of future mergers and/or business combinations, may increase the length of time and amount of resources required to consummate such transactions, and may reduce the anticipated benefit;\n\n•the impact of any claims or legal actions to which we may be subject, including any effect on our reputation;\n\n5\n\n•compliance with governmental and regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and others relating to banking, consumer protection, securities and tax matters, and our ability to maintain licenses required in connection with commercial mortgage origination, sale and servicing operations;\n\n•changes in the scope and cost of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance and other coverage;\n\n•changes in our accounting standards;\n\n•changes in tariffs and trade barriers;\n\n•changes in federal tax law or policy;\n\n•the institution and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings against us or to which we may become subject to;\n\n•the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes;\n\n•examinations by our regulatory authorities; \n\n•the effects of war or other conflicts (including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine or the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas), acts of terrorism, acts of God, natural disasters, health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics, climate changes; or other catastrophic events that may affect general economic conditions;\n\n•risks related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) strategies and initiatives, the scope and pace of which could alter the Company’s reputation and shareholder, associate, customer and third-party affiliations;\n\n•a deterioration of the credit rating for U.S. long-term sovereign debt, actions that the U.S. government may take to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling, and uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and the federal budget;

Because of these risks and other uncertainties, our actual future results, performance or achievement, or industry results, may be materially different from the results indicated by the forward looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results. You should not rely on any forward looking statements, which represent our beliefs, assumptions and estimates only as of the dates on which they were made, as predictions of future events. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n6\n\nPart I\n\nItem 1\n\nBusiness\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC.\n\nGeneral\n\nColony Bankcorp, Inc. (the “Company” or “Colony”) is a financial services company and a registered bank holding company headquartered in Fitzgerald, Georgia. The Company was incorporated on November 8, 1982 under the laws of the State of Georgia. The Company was organized for the purpose of operating as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the bank holding company laws of Georgia. Our business is conducted primarily through our wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Colony Bank, a Georgia state-chartered commercial bank, which provides a broad range of banking services to its retail and commercial customers. We operate thirty-four locations in Georgia and have expanded our presence in 2023 to serve Birmingham, Alabama, as well as Tallahassee and the Florida Panhandle. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately $3.1 billion in total assets, $1.9 billion in total loans, $2.5 billion in total deposits and $254.9 million in stockholder’s equity. Deposits are insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nThe Parent Company\n\nBecause the Company is a financial services company and a registered bank holding company, its principal operations are conducted through the Bank. It has 100 percent ownership of the Bank and maintains systems of financial, operational and administrative controls that permit centralized evaluation of the operations of the Bank in selected functional areas including operations, accounting, marketing, investment management, purchasing, human resources, computer services, auditing, compliance and credit review. As a bank holding company, we also perform certain shareholder and investor relations functions.\n\nColony Bank - Banking Services\n\nOur principal subsidiary is the Bank. The Bank, headquartered in Fitzgerald, Georgia, offers traditional banking products and services to commercial and consumer customers in our markets. Our product line includes, among other things, loans to small and medium-sized businesses, residential and commercial construction and land development loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, agri-business and production loans, residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, consumer loans and a variety of demand, savings and time deposit products. We also offer internet banking services, electronic bill payment services, safe deposit box rentals, telephone banking, credit and debit card services, remote depository products and access to a network of ATMs to our customers. In addition to our traditional banking services, Colony provides specialized solutions including mortgage, government guaranteed lending, consumer insurance, wealth management and merchant services. The Bank conducts its business through thirty-four offices located in north, central, south and coastal Georgia cities of Fitzgerald, Warner Robins, Centerville, Ashburn, Leesburg, Cordele, Albany, LaGrange, Columbus, Sylvester, Tifton, Moultrie, Douglas, Broxton, Savannah, Eastman, Fayetteville, Rochelle, Rockmart, Cedartown, Chickamauga, Atlanta, Athens, Augusta, Macon, Manchester, Quitman, Thomaston, Valdosta and Statesboro, Georgia along with a corporate banking office in Birmingham, Alabama and a loan production office in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nRecent Capital Developments\n\nStock Offering\n\nOn February 10, 2022, the Company completed a public offering of 3,848,485 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $16.50 per share, with aggregate proceeds of approximately $63.5 million.\n\n7\n\nSubordinated Notes\n\nOn May 20, 2022, the Company completed a private placement of $40.0 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2032 (the \"Notes\"). The Notes will bear a fixed rate of 5.25% for the first five years and will reset quarterly thereafter to then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 265 basis points for the five-year floating term. The Company is entitled to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after May 20, 2027, or at any time, in whole but not in part, upon certain other specified events. At December 31, 2023, $39.2 million of the Notes were outstanding.\n\nStock Buyback Program\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a stock buyback program, under which the Company could repurchase up to $12 million of its outstanding common stock. Repurchases under this program were made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or such other manners as complied with applicable laws and regulations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 41,481 shares at a price of $9.78. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 40,000 at a price of $13.50. The buyback program expired at the end of 2023. \n\nMarkets and Competition\n\nThe banking industry in general is highly competitive. Our market areas consist of north, central, south and coastal Georgia. In contrast to our rural markets, in which we typically rank in the top three in terms of market share, we face competitive pressures in attracting deposits and making loans from larger regional banks and smaller community banks. The Bank's competition includes not only other banks of comparable or larger size in the same markets, but also various other nonbank financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, personal and commercial financial companies, peer to peer lending businesses, fintech companies, investment brokerage and financial advisory firms and mutual fund companies. The Bank competes for deposits, commercial, fiduciary and investment services and various types of loans and other financial services. The Bank also competes for interest-bearing funds with a number of other financial intermediaries, including brokerage and insurance firms, as well as investment alternatives, including mutual funds, governmental and corporate bonds, and other securities. Continued consolidation and rapid technological changes within the financial services industry will likely change the nature and intensity of competition, but also will create opportunities for the Company to demonstrate and leverage its competitive advantages. The continuing consolidation within the financial services industry is leading to larger, better capitalized and geographically diverse institutions with enhanced product and technology capabilities. Additionally, competition from fintechs, is increasing. In addition to fintechs, certain technology companies are working to provide financial services directly to their customers. These nontraditional financial service providers have been successful in developing digital and other products and services that effectively compete with traditional banking services, but are in some cases subject to fewer regulatory restrictions than banks and bank holding companies, allowing them to operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. Although digital products and services have been important competitive features of financial institutions for some time, the move toward digital financial services products has accelerated in recent years and we expect that trend to continue.\n\nCompetitors include not only financial institutions based in Georgia, but also a number of large out-of-state and foreign banks, bank holding companies and other financial institutions that have an established market presence in Georgia or that offer internet-based products. Many of the Company's competitors are engaged in local, regional, national and international operations and have greater assets, personnel and other resources. Some of these competitors are subject to less regulation and/or more favorable tax treatment. Many of these institutions have greater resources, broader geographic markets and higher lending limits, and may offer services that the Company does not offer. In addition, these institutions may be able to better afford and make broader use of media advertising, support services, and electronic and other technology. To offset these potential competitive disadvantages, the Company depends on its reputation for superior service, ability to make credit and other business decisions quickly, and the delivery of an integrated distribution of traditional branches and bankers, with digital technology.\n\n8\n\nCorrespondents\n\nColony Bank has correspondent relationships with the following banks: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta; FHN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee; SouthState Bank in Lake Wales, Florida, ServisFirst in Birmingham, Alabama and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. These correspondent relationships facilitate the transaction of business by means of loans, collections, investment services, lines of credit and exchange services, particularly in markets in which Colony Bank does not have a physical presence. As compensation for these services, the Bank maintains balances with its correspondents in primarily interest-bearing accounts and pays some service charges.\n\nHuman Capital Resources\n\nWe recognize that our most valuable asset is our people. One of our top strategic priorities is the retention and development of our talent. This includes providing career development opportunities for all associates; increasing our diversity and inclusion; training our next generation of leaders; and succession planning.\n\nOn December 31, 2023, the Company had a total of 464 employees, 453 of which are full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit or is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.\n\nTalent Acquisition, Development and Retention \n\nOur culture emphasizes our longstanding dedication to being respectful to others and having a workforce that is representative of the communities we serve. Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to our culture. We believe in attracting, retaining and promoting quality talent and recognize that diversity makes us stronger as a company. Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and develop employees, and our talent acquisition teams partner with hiring managers in sourcing and presenting a diverse slate of qualified candidates to strengthen our organization. Professional development is a key priority, which is facilitated through our many corporate development initiatives including extensive training programs, corporate mentoring, leadership programs, educational reimbursement and professional speaker series.\n\nHealth and Welfare \n\nAs part of our effort to attract and retain employees, we offer a broad range of benefits, including a profit-sharing plan covering all employees, subject to certain minimum age and service requirements. In addition, the Company maintains a comprehensive employee benefit program providing, among other benefits, hospitalization, major medical, life insurance and disability insurance. Management considers these benefits to be competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our market area. Colony’s employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group.\n\nCorporate Information \n\nThe Company’s headquarters is located at 115 South Grant Street, Fitzgerald, Georgia 31750, its telephone number is 229-426-6000 and its internet address is www.colonybank.com. The information contained on or accessible from our website does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference herein.\n\nPublic Information\n\nPersons interested in obtaining information on the Company may read and copy any materials that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The Commission maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at https://www.sec.gov. We make available, free of charge, on or through our website, https://investors.colony.bank.com/sec-filings, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and other filings pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and amendments to such filings, as soon as reasonably practicable after each is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.\n\n9\n\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\n\nGeneral\n\nWe are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The following is a brief summary that does not purport to be a complete description of all regulations that affect us or all aspects of those regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions described below and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to the Company’s and the Bank’s business. In addition, proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal levels. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, and the impact such changes may have on us and the Bank, are difficult to predict. In addition, bank regulatory agencies may issue enforcement actions, policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to us or the Bank. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, or their interpretation by regulatory agencies or courts may have a material adverse effect on our and the Bank’s business, operations, and earnings. Supervision and regulation of banks, their holding companies and affiliates is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and the U.S. banking and financial system rather than holders of our capital stock.\n\nRegulation of the Company\n\nWe are registered as a bank holding company with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) and have elected to be treated as a financial holding company. As such, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and are subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. Federal law subjects financial holding companies, such as the Company, to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and unsound practices, may result in regulatory agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other enforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers, directors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.\n\nActivity Limitations. As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company that has not elected to be a financial holding company. Bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking, managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental or, if determined by the Federal Reserve, complementary to financial activities. We and Colony Bank must each remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” and Colony Bank must receive a CRA rating of at least “Satisfactory” at its most recent examination in order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company. If Colony Bank ceases to be “well capitalized” or “well managed” under applicable regulatory standards, or if Colony Bank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the CRA, the Federal Reserve Board may, among other things, place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require us to divest the banking subsidiary or the businesses engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies. \n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company.\n\nSource of Strength Obligations. A financial holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to maintain resources adequate to support its bank. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution (in the case of the Bank, this agency is the FDIC) may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of financial distress. If we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as appropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment.\n\n10\n\nAcquisitions. The BHC Act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies, such that we and any other bank holding company, whether located in Georgia or elsewhere, may acquire a bank located in any other state, subject to certain deposit-percentage, age of bank charter requirements, and other restrictions. The BHC Act requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company, (ii) taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. The Federal Reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the United States, or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country, or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider: (1) the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the United States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, further described below; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering.\n\nChange in Control. Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the Change in Bank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as the Company, and the FDIC before acquiring control of the Bank. Upon receipt of such notice, the bank regulatory agencies may approve or disapprove the acquisition. The Change in Bank Control Act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of our outstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently, shareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock.\n\nGovernance and Financial Reporting Obligations. We are required to comply with various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the Nasdaq Stock Market. In particular, we are required to include management and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including compliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time and money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially adversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our securities.\n\nCorporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses many investor protections, corporate governance, and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhances independence requirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt incentive-based compensation claw-back policies for executive officers.\n\nIncentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act required the banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint rules or guidelines for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets, such as us and the Bank, which prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that the agencies determine to encourage inappropriate risks by the institution. The federal banking agencies issued proposed rules in 2011 and previously issued guidance on sound incentive compensation policies. In 2016, the federal banking agencies also proposed rules that would, depending upon the assets of the institution, directly regulate incentive compensation arrangements and would require enhanced oversight and recordkeeping. As of December 31, 2023, these rules have not been implemented. We and the Bank have undertaken efforts to ensure that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage inappropriate risks, consistent with three key principles - that incentive compensation arrangements should appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, be compatible with effective controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. On October 26, 2022, the SEC adopted final rules to implement Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act that require public companies to adopt and disclose a policy for the recovery of incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers that is based on erroneously reported financial information in the event of a required accounting restatement. The rules also require disclosure of the policy, including filing the policy as an exhibit to annual reports on Form 10-K and additional disclosure in the event an accounting restatement is required and recovery is triggered under the policy. \n\nShareholder Say-On-Pay Votes. The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to take shareholders’ votes on proposals addressing compensation (known as say-on-pay), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes available to \n\n11\n\nexecutives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every six years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially. The say-on-pay, the say-on-parachute and the say-on-frequency votes are explicitly nonbinding and cannot override a decision of our board of directors.\n\nOther Regulatory Matters. We and our subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, (“FINRA”), the PCAOB, the Nasdaq Stock Market and various state securities regulators. We and our subsidiaries have from time to time received requests for information from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.\n\nCapital Requirements. The Company and the Bank are each required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant provisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.\n\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total risk-based capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock instruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, plus retained earnings, and certain qualifying minority interests, less certain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and certain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance sheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain “high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings.\n\nThe leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average total consolidated assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%.\n\nIn addition, as of January 1, 2019, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, constituted of CET1, above each of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank to be able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management without restriction. \n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), among other things, requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. \n\nTo be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:\n\n•6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n\n•8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;\n\n•10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and\n\n•5.0% Leverage ratio.\n\n12\n\nFailure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. For example, only a well-capitalized depository institution may accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other restrictions on its growth.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the current capital rules. For purposes of the FRB's Regulation Y, including determining whether a bank holding company meets the requirements to be a financial holding company, bank holding companies, such as the Company, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater to be well-capitalized. \n\nThe Company is required to comply with minimum regulatory capital levels due to surpassing the $3 billion asset threshold in 2023. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) signed into law in May 2018 scaled back certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and provided other regulatory relief. Among the provisions of the Economic Growth Act was a requirement that the Federal Reserve raise the asset threshold for those bank holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (“Policy Statement”) to $3 billion. As a result, as of the effective date of that change in 2018, the Company was no longer required to comply with the risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank as described above from 2018 until June 2023 when its assets passed the $3 billion asset threshold.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the then-applicable capital conservation buffer.\n\nAs a result of the Economic Growth Act, the federal banking agencies were also required to develop a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) for financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. A “qualifying community bank” that exceeds this ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, including the capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under prompt corrective action statutes. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution's risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The federal banking agencies set the minimum capital for the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9%. The Bank has not opted into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework.\n\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, which introduced CECL as the methodology to replace the “incurred loss” methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost, and changed the approaches for recognizing and recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased credit impaired financial assets. Under the incurred loss methodology, credit losses are recognized only when the losses are probable or have been incurred; under CECL, companies are required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses for the lifetime of the financial assets, based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This change will result in earlier recognition of credit losses that the Company deems expected but not yet probable. For SEC reporting companies with smaller reporting company designation and December 31 fiscal-year ends, such as the Company, CECL became effective in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nPayment of Dividends. We are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our primary source of cash, other than securities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. Under the laws of the State of Georgia, we, as a business corporation, may declare and pay dividends in cash or property unless the payment or declaration would be contrary to restrictions contained in our Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or unless, after payment of the dividend, we would not be able to pay our debts when they become due in the usual course of our business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities. In addition, we are also subject to federal regulatory capital requirements that effectively limit the amount of cash dividends that we may pay.\n\nThe primary sources of funds for our payment of dividends to our shareholders are cash on hand and dividends from the Bank and our non-bank subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and our non-bank subsidiaries may pay. The Bank is a Georgia bank. Under the regulations of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance, a Georgia bank must have approval of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance to pay cash dividends if, at the time of such payment:\n\n•the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets is less than 6%;\n\n13\n\n•the aggregate amount of dividends to be declared or anticipated to be declared during the current calendar year exceeds 50% of its net after-tax profits before dividends for the previous calendar year; or\n\n•its total adversely classified assets in its most recent regulatory examination exceeded 80% of its Tier 1 capital plus its allowance for loan and lease losses.\n\nThe Georgia Financial Institutions Code contains restrictions on the ability of a Georgia bank to pay dividends other than from retained earnings without the approval of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance. As a result of the foregoing restrictions, the Bank may be required to seek approval from the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance to pay dividends.\n\nIn addition, we and the Bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal bank regulatory authority may prohibit the payment of dividends where it has determined that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve have each indicated that depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Prior approval by the FDIC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year exceeds the bank’s profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years.\n\nUnder a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank holding company’s dividends if:\n\n•its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n\n•its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or\n\n•it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\n\nRegulation of the Bank\n\nThe Bank is subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the FDIC and is subject to its regulatory reporting requirements. The Bank also is subject to certain Federal Reserve regulations. In addition, as discussed in more detail below, the Bank and any other of our subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products and services are subject to regulation and potential supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"). Authority to supervise and examine the Company and the Bank for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, respectively. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. The CFPB also may participate in examinations of our other direct or indirect subsidiaries that offer consumer financial products or services. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce certain federal consumer financial protection rules adopted by the CFPB.\n\nBroadly, regulations applicable to the Bank include limitations on loans to a single borrower and to its directors, officers and employees; restrictions on the opening and closing of branch offices; the maintenance of required capital and liquidity ratios; the granting of credit under equal and fair conditions; the disclosure of the costs and terms of such credit; requirements to maintain reserves against deposits and loans; limitations on the types of investment that may be made by the Bank; and requirements governing risk management practices. The Bank is permitted under federal law to branch on a de novo basis across state lines where the laws of that state would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch.\n\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders. The Bank is subject to restrictions on extensions of credit and certain other transactions between the Bank and the Company or any nonbank affiliate. Generally, these covered transactions with either the Company or any affiliate are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus, and all such transactions between the Bank and the Company and all of its nonbank affiliates combined are limited to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. Loans and other extensions of credit from the Bank to the Company or any affiliate generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, any transaction between the Bank and the Company or any affiliate are required to be on an arm’s length basis. Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on certain extensions of credit by insured banks, such as the Bank, to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders.\n\n14\n\nReserves. Federal Reserve rules require depository institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily interest bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts. Effective March 26, 2020, reserve requirement ratios were reduced to zero percent. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.\n\nFDIC Insurance Assessments and Depositor Preference. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC’s DIF up to the limits under applicable law, which currently are set at $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The Bank is subject to FDIC assessments for its deposit insurance. The FDIC calculates quarterly deposit insurance assessments based on an institution’s average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity, and applies one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels, supervisory ratings, and certain other factors. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. \n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30%, below the statutory minimum of 1.35%. The FDIC, as required under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan on September 15, 2020, to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted an amended restoration plan to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio would be restored to at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. The FDIC’s amended restoration plan increases the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The FDIC could further increase the deposit insurance assessments for certain insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if the DIF reserve ratio is not restored as projected.\n\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including those of the parent bank holding company.\n\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation; (4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality.\n\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator determines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering.  A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-money laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment advisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. Government to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions, including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money laundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned accounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act’s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. The Bank has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect changes required by law. \n\nFinCEN has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators are focusing their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where necessary, our anti-money laundering compliance programs.\n\n15\n\nBanking regulators will consider compliance with the Act’s money laundering provisions in acting upon acquisition and merger proposals. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and have been active in imposing cease and desist and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations. Sanctions for violations of the Act can be imposed in an amount equal to twice the sum involved in the violating transaction, up to $1 million. On January 1, 2021, Congress passed federal legislation that made sweeping changes to federal anti-money laundering laws, including changes that will be implemented in 2021 and subsequent years.\n\nEconomic Sanctions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of Congress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities, which could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate authorities.\n\nConcentrations in Lending. As part of the adoption of CECL by the Company on January 1, 2023, the Company updated its calculations for credit concentrations to use guidance issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies for financial institutions after CECL implementation. The guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. Under the new guidance, a financial institution will be considered to have a significant commercial real estate (\"CRE\") concentration risk, and will be subject to enhanced supervisory expectations to manage that risk, if:\n\n•total reported loans for construction, land & land development represent 100% or more of a bank’s tier 1 capital plus the allowance for credit losses for loans; or\n\n•total reported loans for construction, land & land development plus non-owner occupied CRE represent 300% or more of a bank's tier 1 capital plus the allowance for credit losses for loans and the outstanding balance of the bank's CRE loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's construction, land & land development concentration as a percentage of capital totaled 82.6% and our CRE concentration, net of owner occupied loans, as a percentage of capital totaled 281.0%. As of December 31, 2023, both percentages were below the established regulatory guidelines. \n\nWe have always had exposures to loans secured by commercial real estate due to the nature of our markets and the loan needs of both retail and commercial customers. We believe our long term experience in CRE lending, underwriting policies, internal controls, and other policies currently in place, as well as our loan and credit monitoring and administration procedures, which include calculation of the above two ratios, are generally appropriate to managing our concentrations as required under the guidance.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), which imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities where the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The FDIC’s assessment of the Bank’s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not preclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding company. Following the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB”), CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed and annual CRA reports must be made to a bank’s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become or remain a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under GLB may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a “satisfactory” CRA rating in its latest CRA examination. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a prohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. The Bank has a rating of “Satisfactory” in its most recent CRA evaluation.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, the OCC, FRB, and FDIC issued a final rule to modernize their respective CRA regulations. The revised rules substantially alter the methodology for assessing compliance with the CRA with material aspects taking effect January 1, 2026 and revised data reporting requirements taking effect January 1, 2027. Among other things, the revised rules evaluate lending outside traditional assessment areas generated by the growth of non-branch delivery systems, such as online and mobile banking, apply a metrics-based benchmarking approach to assessment, and clarify eligible CRA activities. The final rule may make it more challenging and/or costly for the Bank to receive a rating of at least \"satisfactory\" on its CRA exam.\n\nPrivacy and Data Security. The GLB generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are \n\n16\n\nfurther required to disclose their privacy policies to customers annually. Financial institutions, however, will be required to comply with state law if it is more protective of consumer privacy than the GLB. The GLB also directed federal regulators, including the FDIC, to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. The Bank is subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying customers in the event of a security breach. Under federal law, the Bank must disclose its privacy policy to consumers, permit customers to opt out of having nonpublic customer information disclosed to third parties in certain circumstances and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary. States may adopt more extensive privacy protections. We are similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused. The federal banking agencies require banks to notify their regulators within 36 hours of a “computer-security incident” that rises to the level of a “notification incident.”\n\nConsumer Regulation. Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that:\n\n•limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank, including new rules respecting the terms of credit cards and of debit card overdrafts;\n\n•govern the Bank’s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;\n\n•require the Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;\n\n•prohibit the Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it makes decisions to extend credit;\n\n•govern the manner in which the Bank may collect consumer debts; and\n\n•prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services.\n\nMortgage Regulation. The CFPB adopted a rule that implements the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “ATR/QM rule”), which requires lenders to consider, among other things, income, employment status, assets, payment amounts, and credit history before approving a mortgage, and provides a compliance “safe harbor” for lenders that issue certain “qualified mortgages.” The ATR/QM rule defines a “qualified mortgage” to have certain specified characteristics, and generally prohibit loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years from being qualified mortgages. The rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that monthly payments be calculated based on the highest payment that will apply in the first five years of the loan and that the borrower have a total debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43%. While “qualified mortgages” will generally be afforded safe harbor status, a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements will attach to “qualified mortgages” that are “higher priced mortgages” (which are generally subprime loans). In addition, the securitizer of asset-backed securities must retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities, unless subject to an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as “qualified residential mortgages.”\n\nThe CFPB has also issued rules to implement requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act pertaining to mortgage loan origination (including with respect to loan originator compensation and loan originator qualifications) as well as integrated mortgage disclosure rules. In addition, the CFPB has issued rules that require servicers to comply with new standards and practices with regard to: error correction; information disclosure; force-placement of insurance; information management policies and procedures; requiring information about mortgage loss mitigation options be provided to delinquent borrowers; providing delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower’s mortgage loan account; and evaluating borrowers’ applications for available loss mitigation options. These rules also address initial rate adjustment notices for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), periodic statements for residential mortgage loans, and prompt crediting of mortgage payments and response to requests for payoff amounts.\n\nNon-Discrimination Policies. The Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (the “ECOA”) and the Fair Housing Act (the “FHA”), both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national origin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists, how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA. \n\nLIBOR. On March 15, 2022, Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) to address references to LIBOR in contracts that (i) are governed by U.S. law; (ii) will not mature before June 30, 2023; and (iii) lack \n\n17\n\nfallback provisions providing for a clearly defined and practicable replacement for LIBOR. On December 16, 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule to implement the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) that replaced LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. The final rule identified replacement benchmark rates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month LIBOR in contracts subject to the LIBOR Act.\n\n18\n\nItem 1A.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, you should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption “Risk Factors” in evaluating us and our business and making or continuing an investment in our stock. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the material risks described below. Many of these risks are beyond our control although efforts are made to manage those risks while simultaneously optimizing operational and financial results. The occurrence of any of the following risks, as well as risks of which we are currently unaware or currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could materially and adversely affect our assets, business, cash flows, condition (financial or otherwise), liquidity, prospects, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. \n\nIn addition, certain statements in the following risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 1 of this Annual Report.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nDifficult or volatile conditions in the national financial markets and local economies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to weak economic conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally or specifically in the state of Georgia, the principal market in which we conduct business. We are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. The global credit and financial markets have from time to time experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including as a result of severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation, the U.S. government’s decisions regarding its debt ceiling and the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, increased delinquencies on mortgage, commercial and consumer loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines, and lower home sales and commercial activity, changes in securities markets and uncertainty about economic stability. As a result, financial institutions continue to be affected by uncertainty, including in the real estate market, the credit markets, and the national financial market generally. We retain direct exposure to the commercial and residential real estate markets, and we are affected by events in these markets. The financial markets and the global economy may also be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including the current conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, which are increasing volatility in commodity and energy prices, creating supply chain issues and causing instability in financial markets. Sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries in response to such conflicts could further adversely impact the financial markets and the global economy, and any economic countermeasures by the affected countries or others could exacerbate market and economic instability. \n\nMoreover, substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in Georgia, and all of our branches and most of our deposit customers are also located in this area. As a result, local economic conditions significantly affect the demand for loans and other products we offer to our customers (including real estate, commercial and construction loans), the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A decline in the economies in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including, but not limited to the following:\n\n•demand for our loans, deposits and services may decline;\n\n•loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\n•weak economic conditions may continue to limit the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers, limiting our capacity to leverage our retail deposits and maintain our net interest income;\n\n•collateral for our loans may decline further in value; and\n\n•the amount of our low-cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease.\n\nStrong competition and changing banking environment may limit growth and profitability.\n\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment \n\n19\n\nbanking firms operating locally and elsewhere, non-traditional financial institutions, including fintech companies, and non-depository financial services providers. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Additionally, non-traditional financial institutions may not have the same regulatory requirements or burdens as we do, despite playing a rapidly increasing role in the financial services industry including providing services previously limited to commercial banks. Such competition could ultimately limit our growth, profitability and shareholder value, as increased competition in our markets may result in reduced loans, deposits and commissions and brokers’ fees, gains on sales, servicing fees, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. If we are unable to successfully compete in our market areas and adapt to the ever changing banking environment, we may be unable to continue to grow our business, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. We also compete with many forms of payments offered by both bank and non-bank providers, including a variety of new and evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products, such as aggregators and web-based and wireless payment platforms or technologies, digital or “crypto” currencies, prepaid systems and payment services targeting users of social networks, communications platforms and online gaming. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology competitively to offer products and services that provide convenience to customers and create additional efficiencies in our operations.\n\nSome of our competitors have reduced or eliminated certain service charges on deposit accounts, including overdraft fees, and additional competitors may be willing to reduce or eliminate service or other fees in order to attract additional customers. If the Company chooses to reduce or eliminate certain categories of fees, including those related to deposit accounts, fee income related to these products and services would be reduced. If the Company chooses not to take such actions, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in attracting customers for certain fee producing products. \n\nFluctuations in interest rates may impact net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nNet interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, is a major component of our income and our primary source of revenue from our operations. A further narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We cannot control or predict with certainty changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, affect interest income and interest expense. \n\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including, without limitation: the rate of inflation; economic conditions; federal monetary policies; and stability of domestic and foreign markets. Interest rates increased significantly in 2023 as the Federal Reserve attempted to slow economic growth and counteract rising inflation. Further changes in interest rates and monetary policy reportedly are dependent upon the Federal Reserve’s assessment of economic data as it becomes available, and the Company cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, economic, or other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company's business activities, financial condition and results of operations. Increasing interest rates can have a negative impact on our business by reducing the amount of money our customers borrow or by adversely affecting their ability to repay outstanding loan balances that may increase due to adjustments in their variable rates. This may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment we may have to offer more attractive interest rates to depositors to compete for deposits, or pursue other sources of liquidity, such as wholesale funds. Conversely, lower interest rates may reduce our realized yield on variable rate loans and investment securities and on new loans and securities, which would reduce our interest income and cause downward pressure on net interest income and net interest margin. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could result in a decrease in net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates impacts both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, asset quality, liquidity, or financial condition. A prolonged period of volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. \n\nWe have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates and actively manage these risks through hedging and other risk mitigation strategies. However, these risks are often outside of our control, and if our assumptions are wrong or overall economic conditions are significantly different than anticipated, our risk mitigation techniques may be ineffective or costly.\n\n20\n\nInflation could negatively impact our business, our profitability and our stock price. \n\nInflation continued rising in 2023 and inflationary pressures remained elevated throughout 2023 and are likely to continue into 2024. Prolonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention, and negatively impacting the demand for our products and services. Additionally, inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and clients purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease our appetite for new credit extensions. These inflationary pressures could result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing our stock price to suffer. \n\nOur future success is largely dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our business strategy. \n\nOur future success, including our ability to achieve our growth and profitability goals, is dependent on the ability of our management team to execute on our long-term business strategy, which requires them to, among other things: maintain and enhance our reputation; attract and retain experienced and talented bankers in each of our markets; maintain adequate funding sources, including by continuing to attract stable, low-cost deposits; enhance our market penetration in our metropolitan markets and maintain our leadership position in our community markets; improve our operating efficiency; implement new technologies to enhance the client experience and keep pace with our competitors; attract and maintain commercial banking relationships with well-qualified businesses, real estate developers and investors with proven track records in our market areas; attract sufficient loans that meet prudent credit standards; maintain adequate liquidity and regulatory capital and comply with applicable federal and state banking regulations; manage our credit, interest rate and liquidity risks; develop new, and grow our existing, streams of noninterest income; oversee the performance of third-party service providers that provide material services to our business; and control expenses in line with current projections. \n\nFailure to achieve these strategic goals could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies and could negatively impact our business, growth prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if we do not manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected, and we may not be able to continue to implement our business strategy and successfully conduct our operations.\n\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and/or investment securities and through other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of our customer deposits. Such deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, which would require us to seek wholesale funding alternatives in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. Moreover, competition among U.S. banks and non-banks for customer deposits is intense and may increase the cost of deposits (particularly in an elevated rate environment) or prevent new deposits and may otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base. In addition, our access to deposits may be affected by the liquidity and/or cash flow needs of depositors, which may be exacerbated in an inflationary, recessionary, or elevated rate environment. This may cause our deposit accounts to decrease in the future, and any such decrease could have a material adverse impact on our sources of funding. \n\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations, investment maturities and sales, sale of loans and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by our ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. We also may borrow from third-party lenders from time to time. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\n\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to continue to implement our strategic plan, including our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n21\n\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully manage our asset quality and credit risk.\n\nWe are subject to the risk of losses resulting from the failure of borrowers, guarantors and related parties to pay us the interest and principal amounts due on their loans. Although we maintain well-defined credit policies and credit underwriting and monitoring and collection procedures, these policies and procedures may not prevent losses, as some of these risks are outside of our control, particularly during periods in which the local, regional or national economy suffers a general decline. Moreover, \n\nthe future effects of the continued elevated inflationary and interest rate environment on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. If borrowers fail to repay their loans, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\nOur commercial real estate, real estate construction, and commercial business loans increase our exposure to credit risks.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, our portfolio of commercial real estate and commercial, financial and agricultural loans totaled $1.5 billion or 77.7% of total loans compared to $1.4 billion, or 82.3% of total loans at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, the amount of nonperforming commercial real estate and commercial, financial and agricultural loans was $6.3 million, or 61.3% of total nonperforming loans. These loans may expose us to a greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential real estate loans because, in the case of commercial loans, repayment often depends on the successful operation and earnings of the borrower's businesses and, in the case of consumer loans, the applicable collateral is subject to rapid depreciation. Additionally, commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest due on the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\nBecause a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loans and other losses.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 83.8% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. As a result, adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market areas could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses, which could result in losses that would adversely affect credit quality, profitability, financial condition, and results of operation. Such declines and losses would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, the value and salability of properties pledged as collateral could be adversely impacted as a result of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and we may incur significant remediation costs or expenses as a result. .\n\nOur provision and allowance for credit losses may not cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan and lease portfolio and utilize these assumptions and judgments when determining the provision and allowance for credit losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the provision and allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks suing existing qualitative and quantitative information and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the amount reserved in the allowance for credit losses. \n\nBecause the risk rating of the loans is dependent on some subjective information and subject to changes in the borrower's credit risk profile, evolving local market conditions and other factors, it can be difficult for us to predict the effects that those factors will have on the classifications assigned to the loan portfolio, and thus difficult to anticipate the velocity or volume of the migration of loans through the classification process and effect on the level of the allowance for credit losses. In addition, due \n\n22\n\nto the declining economic conditions, our customers may not be able to repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. While we maintain our allowance to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, losses may exceed the value of the collateral securing the loans and the allowance may not fully cover any excess loss. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our provision and the total allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses or future provisions for credit losses on loans, based on judgments different than those of management. Any increases in the provision or allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in our net income and, potentially, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe may not be able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments.\n\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement. The borrowing needs of our customers may exceed our expected funding requirements, especially during a challenging economic environment when our client companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit, or the limited availability of financings from other sources. Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the borrowing needs of our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.\n\nWe use brokered deposits which may be an unstable and/or expensive deposit source to fund earning asset growth. \n\nWe use brokered deposits, as a source of funding to support our asset growth and augment deposits generated from our branch network, which are our principal source of funding. We have established policies and procedures with respect to the use of brokered deposits, which require, among other things, that (i) we limit the amount of brokered deposits as a percentage of total assets, and (ii) our asset liability committee monitors our use of brokered deposits on a regular basis, including interest rates and the total volume of such deposits in relation to our total assets. In the event that our funding strategies call for the use of brokered deposits, there can be no assurance that such sources will be available, or will remain available, or that the cost of such funding sources will be reasonable. Additionally, if the Bank is no longer considered well-capitalized, our ability to access new brokered deposits or retain existing brokered deposits could be affected by market conditions, regulatory requirements or a combination thereof, which could result in most, if not all, brokered deposit sources being unavailable. The inability to utilize brokered deposits as a source of funding could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\n\nWe hold certain intangible assets that in the future could be classified as either partially or fully impaired, which would reduce our earnings and the book values of these assets.\n\nPursuant to applicable accounting requirements, we are required to periodically test our goodwill and core deposit intangible assets for impairment. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common shares, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. Future impairment testing may result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill or core deposit intangible assets, or both. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. \n\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\n\nTo the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we may not be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. In addition, such acquisitions may involve the issuance of securities, which may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. Acquiring banks, bank branches or businesses involves risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:\n\n•potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities we acquire;\n\n•exposure to potential asset quality problems of the acquired financial institutions, businesses or branches;\n\n•difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of financial institutions, businesses or branches we acquire;\n\n•higher than expected deposit attrition;\n\n•potential diversion of our management’s time and attention;\n\n•the possible loss of key employees and customers of financial institutions, businesses or branches we acquire;\n\n•difficulty in safely investing any cash generated by the acquisition;\n\n23\n\n•inability to utilize potential tax benefits from such transactions;\n\n•difficulty in estimating the fair value of the financial institutions, businesses or branches to be acquired which affects the profits we generate from the acquisitions; and\n\n•potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the financial institutions or businesses to be acquired or the ability to obtain all required regulatory approvals.\n\nIn addition, we face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which will have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Furthermore, we may not be able to complete future acquisitions and, if we do complete such acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, management, products and services of the entities that we acquire and eliminate redundancies.\n\nIf we are unable to grow our noninterest income, our growth prospects will be impaired.\n\nTaking advantage of opportunities to develop new, and expand existing, streams of noninterest income, including service charges, interchange fees and mortgage fees, is a part of our long-term growth strategy. If we are unsuccessful in our attempts to grow our noninterest income, our long-term growth will be impaired. Furthermore, focusing on these noninterest income streams may divert management’s attention and resources away from our core banking business, which could impair our core business, financial condition and operating results.\n\nDecreased residential mortgage origination, volume and pricing decisions of competitors may adversely affect our profitability.\n\nOur mortgage operation originates residential mortgage loans and services residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates, housing prices, financial stress on borrowers as a result of economic conditions, regulations by the applicable governmental authorities and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our residential mortgage loan products, revenues received from servicing such loans for others, and ultimately reduce our net income. New regulations and increased regulatory reviews may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business.\n\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in further losses in the future. \n\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or OREO, thereby adversely affecting our net interest income, net income and returns on assets and equity, and our loan administration costs increase, which together with reduced interest income adversely affects our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming loans and OREO also increase our risk profile and the level of capital our regulators believe is appropriate for us to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we experience increases in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, our net interest income may be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which would have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such as return on assets and equity.\n\nWe could recognize losses on securities held in our securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\n\nChanges in interest rates may negatively affect both the returns on and market value of our investment securities. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or increase unrealized losses in our portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political issues, and other factors beyond our control. These changes can negatively impact our other comprehensive income and equity levels through accumulated other comprehensive income, which includes net unrealized gains and losses on our investment securities. Further, such losses could be realized into earnings should liquidity and/or business strategy necessitate the sales of securities in a loss position. Additionally, actual investment income and cash flows from investment securities that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed securities and callable securities, may materially differ from those anticipated at the time of investment or subsequently as a result of changes in interest rates and market conditions. These occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income or our results of operations.\n\n24\n\nThe implementation of other new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\n\nWe continuously evaluate our service offerings and may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in the future. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we undergo a new product process to assess the risks of the initiative, and invest significant time and resources to build internal controls, policies and procedures to mitigate those risks, including hiring experienced management to oversee the implementation of the initiative. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could require the establishment of new key and other controls and have a significant impact on our existing system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are highly dependent on our management team, and the loss of our senior executive officers or other key employees could harm our ability to implement our strategic plan, impair our relationships with customers and adversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for the best personnel in most activities we engage in can be intense, as we compete with both smaller banks that may be able to offer bankers with more responsibility and autonomy and larger banks that may be able to offer bankers with higher compensation, resources and support, and we may not be able to hire personnel or to retain them. As a result, we may not be able to effectively compete for talent across our markets. Further, our bankers may leave us to work for our competitors and, in some instances, may take important banking and lending relationships with them to our competitors.If we are unable to attract and retain talented bankers in our markets, our business, growth prospects and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, relationships in the communities we serve, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, there is no guarantee that these officers and other key personnel will remain employed with the Company.\n\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\n\nOur reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. Threats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\n\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to us.\n\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\n\n25\n\nThe financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes, and if we are unable to stay current with those changes, we will not be able to effectively compete.\n\nThe financial services market is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services (including those related to or involving artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies), and an established and growing demand for mobile and other phone and computer banking applications. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to keep pace with the technological changes and to use technology to satisfy and grow customer demand for our products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our market area. We expect that we will need to make substantial investments in our technology and information systems to compete effectively and to stay current with technological changes. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and have invested significantly more than us in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to invest more heavily in developing and adopting new technologies, and offer additional or more convenient products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, which could impair our growth and profitability. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and the failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSystem failure or breaches of our network security, or the security of our data processing subsidiary, including as a result of cyberattacks or data security breaches, could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\n\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to hardware and cyber security issues. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, or a similar catastrophic event. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of employees or other internal or external sources, including our third-party vendors and cyber criminals. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us, including our internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cyber security breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the internet or other users. Such computer break-ins, breaches and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability, damage our reputation and inhibit the use of our internet banking services by current and potentialcustomers, any of which may result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs.\n\nWe are under continuous threat of loss due to hacking and cyberattacks especially as we continue to expand client capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. These cyber risks include greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\n\nTo date, none of foregoing types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations and we maintaina system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. However, no assurances can be provided that we may not suffer from such an attack in the future that may cause us material harm, especially in light of the risks being posed by changing technologies as well as criminal intent on committing cyber-crime.\n\n26\n\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\n\nWe depend to a significant extent on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting, deposit processing and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience financial, operational (including as a result of a cybersecurity incident), or technological difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other suitable service providers, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace our service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, client or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\n\nEmployee errors and employee and client misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our clients or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended.\n\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\n\nProcesses that management uses to estimate our probable incurred credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are accurate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models that management uses for interest rate risk and asset liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models that management uses for determining our probable credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge offs. If the models that management uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in management’s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\n\nFrom time to time, the FASB or the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators or outside auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period financial statements. \n\n27\n\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. \n\nManagement regularly monitors, reviews and updates our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the controls will be effective. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results, preventing or detecting fraud or providing timely and reliable financial information pursuant to our reporting obligations, which could result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and the restatement of previously filed financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, ineffective internal controls could cause our investors to lose confidence in our financial information, which could affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\n\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\n\nHurricanes or other adverse weather events would negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\n\nOur market area is located in the southeastern region of the United States and is susceptible to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, other severe weather events and related flooding and wind damage, and man-made disasters. These natural disasters could negatively impact regional economic conditions, cause a decline in the value or destruction of mortgaged properties and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loss on loans originated by us, damage our banking facilities and offices and negatively impact our growth strategy. Climate change may be increasing the nature, severity and frequency of adverse weather conditions, making the impact from these types of natural disasters on us or our customers worse. Such weather events can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties and negatively affect the local economies in the markets where they operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by future hurricanes or tornadoes will affect our operations or the economies in our current or future market areas, but such weather events could negatively impact economic conditions in these regions and result in a decline in local loan demand and loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of natural or man-made disasters.\n\nWe may need to rely on the financial markets to provide needed capital.\n\nOur common stock is listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. If our capital resources prove in the future to be inadequate to meet our capital requirements, we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital. If conditions in the capital markets are not favorable, we may be constrained in raising capital, and an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when and if needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nThe interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that we, our affiliates and/or our securities receive from recognized rating agencies. Our credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and some factors not entirely within our control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally, and remain subject to change at any time. A downgrade to the credit rating of us or our affiliates could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our profitability. A downgrade to us, our affiliates or our securities could create obligations or liabilities to us under the terms of our outstanding securities that could increase our costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade to the credit rating of any particular security issued by us or our affiliates could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.\n\nBecause our decision to incur debt and issue securities in future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. \n\n28\n\nFurther, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. In addition, geopolitical and worldwide market conditions may cause disruption or volatility in the U.S. equity and debt markets, which could hinder our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the future on favorable terms.\n\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters involving us or other financial institutions or counterparties, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage or to the extent that we incur civil money penalties that are not covered by insurance, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all. Finally, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.” Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. We could become subject to claims based on this or other evolving legal theories in the future.\n\nRisks Related to Legislative and Regulatory Events\n\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, which in turn may adversely impact our ability to increase our assets and earnings.\n\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance (“DBF”) and the FDIC. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for us to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels, and other aspects of our operations. These bank regulators possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business, profitability or growth strategy. Increased regulation could increase our cost of compliance and adversely affect profitability. Moreover, certain of these regulations contain significant punitive sanctions for violations, including monetary penalties and limitations on a bank’s ability to implement components of its business plan, such as expansion through mergers and acquisitions or the opening of new branch offices. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements may add costs associated with compliance efforts. Furthermore, government policy and regulation, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, significantly affect credit conditions. Negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation and regulation in response to those developments could negatively impact our business operations and adversely impact our financial performance. See \"Item 1 - Business - Supervision and Regulation\" for more information on the extensive regulation and supervision the Company and the Bank are subject to.\n\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the DBF periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin “unsafe or unsound” practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to \n\n29\n\ndepositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\n\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe could face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\n\nThe Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. FinCEN, established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and engages in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by OFAC related to U.S. sanctions regimes. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\n\nOur deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings.\n\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution’s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution’s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution’s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability, may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\n\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\nOur management team’s strategies for the enhancement of shareholder value may not succeed.\n\nOur management team is taking and considering actions to enhance shareholder value, including reviewing personnel, developing new products, issuing dividends and exploring acquisition opportunities. These actions may not enhance shareholder value. For example, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are not legally required to do so. Further, the Federal Reserve could decide at any time that paying any dividends on our common stock could be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The reduction or elimination of dividends paid on our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and may lose value.\n\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein, and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\n\n30\n\nOur stock price may be volatile.\n\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock, rising interest rates and the impact of inflation. In addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nESG risks could adversely affect our reputation and shareholder, employee, client and third-party relationships and may negatively affect our stock price.\n\nOur business faces increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity, equity, inclusion, environmental stewardship, human capital management, support for our local communities, corporate governance and transparency, or fail to consider ESG factors in our business operations.\n\nFurthermore, as a result of our diverse base of clients and business partners, we may face potential negative publicity based on the identity of our clients or business partners and the public’s (or certain segments of the public’s) view of those entities. Such publicity may arise from traditional media sources or from social media and may increase rapidly in size and scope. If our client or business partner relationships were to become intertwined in such negative publicity, our ability to attract and retain clients, business partners, and employees may be negatively impacted, and our stock price may also be negatively impacted. Additionally, we may face pressure to not do business in certain industries that are viewed as harmful to the environment or are otherwise negatively perceived, which could impact our growth.\n\nAdditionally, investors and shareholder advocates are placing ever increasing emphasis on how corporations address ESG issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations. We may incur meaningful costs with respect to our ESG efforts and if such efforts are negatively perceived, our reputation and stock price may suffer. In addition, ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.\n\nOur dividend policy may change, and consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment may be if the price of our common stock appreciates.\n\nWe have historically paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders. However, we have no obligationto pay dividends and we may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our shareholders. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors, in its discretion, may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability and requirements, projected liquidity needs, financial condition, and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends paid to our shareholders.\n\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiary, the Bank. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank, which we use as the principal source of funds to pay our expenses. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay us. Such limits are also tied to the earnings of our subsidiary. If the Bank does not receive regulatory approval or if the Bank’s earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, our ability to pay our expenses and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.\n\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\n\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock up to the authorized number of shares set forth in our charter. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee stock option plans, employee stock grants, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. We cannot predict the size of any such future issuances or the effect, if any, that any such future issuances will have on the trading price of our common stock. Any such future issuances of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock may have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\n\n31\n\nIn addition, we may sell additional shares of our common stock in public offerings, and issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities to finance future acquisitions. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares that may be issued in connection with acquisitions), or the perception that such issuance could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\n\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets, including our stock in the Bank, to secure that debt.\n\nWe have the ability to incur debt and pledge our assets to secure that debt. Absent special and unusual circumstances, a holder of indebtedness for borrowed money has rights that are superior to those of holders of common stock. For example, interest must be paid to the lender before dividends can be paid to the shareholders, and loans must be paid off before any assets can be distributed to shareholders if we were to liquidate. Furthermore, we would have to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce our profitability or result in net losses on a consolidated basis even if the Bank were profitable.\n\nItem 1B\n\nUnresolved Staff Comments\n\nNone.\n\nItem 1C\n\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\n\nCybersecurity is an important aspect of Colony’s business operations and the execution of our strategic plans, including growth initiatives. As a financial institution, we face a variety of cybersecurity threats that range from common attacks, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, to more intricate and sophisticated attacks from highly organized adversaries that specifically target the financial services industry. Our customers, vendors, and partners are also vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, and any incident affecting us or any of these stakeholders could significantly impact our operations, performance, and financial results. To address these challenges, we maintain a comprehensive cyber risk management program aimed at identifying, assessing, mitigating, managing, and responding to cybersecurity threats. This program is incorporated into our enterprise risk management framework, covering both our internal information technology systems and customer-facing products and services.\n\nColony has implemented a formal risk management process to address cyber-related risks, encompassing identification, assessment, monitoring, consultation, communication, and review of cyber-related risks which is designed in accordance with industry standards and best practices for cybersecurity and information technology. Annually, our information security standards undergo external audits against the System and Organizational Controls (SOC). Our program undergoes periodic evaluations utilizing the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) Cybersecurity Assessment Tool to gauge our cybersecurity readiness, ensure alignment with associated risks, identify potential areas for improvement or enhancement in our risk management practices and controls, and guide our risk management strategies..\n\nOur information security program incorporates a diverse range of technologies aimed at safeguarding our operations and proprietary information. We have an established Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery program that undergoes regular updates and testing to ensure the protection of our networks, data, systems, and facilities against attacks or unauthorized access. Furthermore, we maintain an Incident Response program outlining Colony's protocols, procedures, and roles for addressing cybersecurity incidents. This program undergoes frequent testing via tabletop exercises, which often yield valuable insights and lead to subsequent enhancements in our Incident Response protocols.\n\nWe believe Colony’s employees have a vital role in the Company’s cybersecurity defenses. Employees at all levels and in all lines of business and support functions participate in training programs on cybersecurity and social engineering to mitigate risk. Exercises to test their effectiveness are conducted on a monthly basis.\n\nThird-party cyber advisors play an important role in Colony's cybersecurity framework, and we have established partnerships with leading cybersecurity entities and organizations to harness external technology and expertise as needed. We regularly enlist independent third-parties to conduct periodic reviews and assessments of our information security program, as well as \n\n32\n\nannual penetration tests on our network. Additionally, we maintain cyber coverage through our insurance carrier to mitigate risks associated with cybersecurity incidents, subject to customary terms and exclusions. Additionally, we exercise cybersecurity due diligence and oversight over critical third-party relationships and vendors ensuring that those with access to personal, confidential, or proprietary information adhere to cybersecurity practices consistent with applicable legal standards and industry best practices\n\nColony remains committed to investing in the development and improvement of our security processes and controls, as well as maintaining our technology infrastructure. These processes include a comprehensive plan for notifying, informing, consulting, analyzing, and communicating any risks or incidents to a range of internal stakeholders, including executive management and the Board, as well as external stakeholders such as regulators, affected individuals, and the investment community, as deemed necessary and appropriate based on the circumstances.\n\nColony’s business relies on the availability, security, reliability, and confidentiality of our information systems, networks, and data. Any disruption, compromise, or breach of these systems or data due to a cybersecurity incident or threat could materially impact our business strategy, financial condition, or results of operation. While the Company has encountered, and will continue to encounter, cyber incidents in the normal course of business, to date, the Company has not experienced a cybersecurity incident that has materially impacted our business strategy, financial condition, or results of operation. Despite our ongoing efforts to continually strengthen our cybersecurity program, there can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management processes and measures described will be fully implemented, complied with, or effective in safeguarding our systems and information. We face risks from certain cybersecurity threats that, if realized, could reasonably be expected to materially affect our business strategy, financial condition, or results of operation. See “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business” of this Report.\n\nCybersecurity Governance\n\nColony’s Information Security Officer (\"ISO\"), reports to Colony’s Chief Risk Officer. Our ISO has ten years of information security experience specific to the financial services industry which includes cybersecurity risk management. The ISO holds relevant certifications and completes annual training. The ISO is responsible for assessing and managing Colony’s cyber risk management program and strategy, informing executive management regarding the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents, and supervising such enterprise-wide efforts.\n\nOur Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Colony’s information security risk management and cybersecurity programs and has delegated primary oversight of cybersecurity to its Technology and Risk Management Committees. The Technology Committee receives quarterly and as needed updates from the Company’s ISO on the Company’s information security and cyber risk strategy, cyber defense initiatives, cyber event preparedness, and cybersecurity risk assessments. As a part of these quarterly updates, the ISO updates the Technology Committee on the development of any new or emerging cyber risks or threats and the appropriate mitigation actions. The Technology Committee routinely provides a report of their activities to the full board of directors.\n\nItem 2\n\nProperties\n\nThe principal properties of the Company consist of the properties of the Bank. The Company's headquarters is located at 115 South Grant Street, Fitzgerald, Georgia 31750. The Bank currently operates thirty-four locations in Georgia, one in Birmingham, Alabama and one in Tallahassee, Florida. The Bank owns all of the banking offices occupied except for eight which are leased. In addition, the Company owns the corporate operation offices located in Fitzgerald, Georgia and Warner Robins Georgia. We believe that our banking offices are in good condition and are suitable and adequate to our needs.\n\n33\n\nItem 3\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nThe Company and its subsidiary may become parties to various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2023, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which Colony or its subsidiary are a party or of which any of its or its subsidiaries' assets or properties are subject. However, one or more unfavorable outcomes in any legal action against us could have a material adverse effect for the period in which they are resolved. In addition, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, such matters are costly, divert management’s attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation, even if resolved in our favor. \n\nItem 4\n\nMine Safety Disclosures\n\nNot applicable.\n\nPart II\n\nItem 5\n\nMarket for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities\n\nMarket Information and Holders of Record\n\nSince April 2, 1998, Colony Bankcorp, Inc.'s common stock has been quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “CBAN.” Prior to this date, there was no public market for the common stock of the Company.\n\nAs of March 12, 2024, there were 17,558,611 shares of our common stock outstanding held by 980 holders of record.\n\nDividends\n\nDuring 2023, the Company paid $7.7 million in cash dividends on its common stock. During 2022, the Company paid $7.2 million in cash dividends on its common stock. We have no obligation to pay dividends and we may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our shareholders. Any future determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, banking regulations, contractual restrictions and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.\n\nAs a Georgia corporation, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on dividends under the Georgia Business Corporation Code. We are also subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. See “Item 1 – Business – Supervision and Regulation – Regulation of the Company – Payment of Dividends.”\n\nIssuer Purchase of Equity Securities\n\nOn October 20, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a stock buyback program, under which the Company could repurchase up to $12 million of its outstanding common stock. The buyback program began on October 20, 2022 and expired on December 31, 2023. There were no repurchases of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\n\nSee the information included under Part III, Item 12, which is incorporated in response to this item by reference, for information with respect to shares of common stock that are authorized for issuance under the Company's equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2023.\n\n34\n\nPerformance Graph\n\nThe performance graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on the Company’s Common Stock with the cumulative total return on the equity securities of companies included in the NASDAQ Composite Index and the SNL Southeast Bank Index, measured at the last trading day of each year shown. The graph assumes an investment of $100 on December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2023, and assumes the reinvestment of dividends, if any. The performance graph represents past performance and should not be considered to be an indication of future performance.\n\nColony Bankcorp, Inc.  \n---  \n  \n![3233](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/03/14/0000711669-24-000046_cban-20231231_g2.jpg)\n\nPeriod Ending   \n---  \nIndex| 12/31/18| 12/31/19| 12/31/20| 12/31/21| 12/31/22| 12/31/23  \nColony Bankcorp, Inc.| 100.00 | 115.12 | 105.58 | 126.14 | 96.45 | 105.34   \nNASDAQ Composite Index| 100.00 | 136.69 | 198.10 | 242.03 | 163.28 | 236.17   \nS&P U.S. BMI Banks - Southeast Region Index| 100.00 | 140.94 | 126.37 | 180.49 | 146.81 | 151.44   \n  \nSource: S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\nItem 6\n\nReserved.\n\n35\n\nItem 7\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and, assumptions. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to those set forth under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\n\nThe Company \n\nColony Bankcorp, Inc. is a bank holding company headquartered in Fitzgerald, Georgia that provides, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Colony Bank (collectively referred to as the Company), a broad array of products and services throughout north, central, south and coastal Georgia markets, Birmingham, Alabama and Tallahassee, Florida. The Company offers commercial and consumer banking services as well as specialized solutions including mortgage, government guaranteed lending, consumer insurance, wealth management and merchant services.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nThe Company paid dividends to its shareholders throughout 2023 and 2022 on a quarterly basis. In 2023, we had a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share of common stock and in 2022, we had a quarterly dividend of $0.1075 per share of common stock.\n\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASC Topic 326 which replaced the incurred loss approach for measuring credit losses with an expected loss model, referred to the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model. CECL applies to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures, which include, but are not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees. The adoption of this guidance resulted in a decrease of the allowance for credit losses on loans of $53,000, the creation of an allowance for unfunded commitments of $1.7 million and a reduction of retained earnings of $1.2 million, net of the increase in deferred tax assets of $410,000.\n\nGoing forward, the impact of utilizing the CECL approach to calculate the allowance for credit losses will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the provision for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings. See Notes 1 and 4, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, for additional information on the allowance for credit losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments.\n\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into two derivative instruments, specifically interest rate swaps, to help manage its interest rate risk position and mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of certain variable rate liabilities. Gains are recorded on the swap transactions as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Amounts reported in accumulated OCI related to swaps are reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Bank's variable rate liabilities. For additional discussion of the Company's derivative instruments, see \"Note 10 - Derivatives\".\n\nReconciliation and Management Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of our performance. These include the fully-taxable equivalent measures: tax-equivalent net interest income, tax-equivalent net interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest spread, which include the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a statutory federal income tax rate of 21% to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Tax-equivalent adjustments are reported to the Average Balances with Average Yields and Rates table under Rate/Volume Analysis in the tables that follow. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information that allows investors to evaluate the ongoing performance of the company and provide meaningful comparisons to its peers. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results and allow investors and company management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance.\n\n36\n\nTax-equivalent net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread. \n\nNet interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from loans and investments. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest income. Net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis is net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest margin. Net interest spread on a tax-equivalent basis is the difference in the average yield on average interest-earning assets on a tax equivalent basis and the average rate paid on average interest-bearing liabilities. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest spread.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP-basis financial statements, and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP measures or similar measures differently.\n\n37\n\nA reconciliation of these performance measures to GAAP performance measures is included in the tables below.\n\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures Reconciliation\n\nYears Ended December 31,  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)| 2023| 2022  \nOperating noninterest income reconciliation  \nNoninterest income (GAAP)| $| 35,634 | $| 35,025   \nGain on sale of bank premises| (361)| —   \nOperating noninterest income| $| 35,273 | $| 35,025   \nOperating noninterest expense reconciliation  \nNoninterest expense (GAAP)| $| 83,065 | $| 89,475   \nSeverance costs| (1,286)| (1,346)  \nAcquisition-related expenses| (161)| (142)  \nOperating noninterest expense| $| 81,618 | $| 87,987   \nOperating net income reconciliation  \nNet income (GAAP)| $| 21,747 | $| 19,542   \nAcquisition-related expenses| 161 | 142   \nSeverance costs| 1,286 | 1,346   \nGain on sale of bank premises| (361)| —   \nFHLB mark from called borrowings| — | 751   \nIncome tax benefit| (196)| (298)  \nOperating net income| $| 22,637 | $| 21,483   \nWeighted average diluted shares| 17,578,294 | 17,191,079   \nAdjusted earnings per diluted share| $| 1.29 | $| 1.25   \nTangible book value per common share reconciliation  \nBook value per common share (GAAP)| $| 14.51 | $| 13.08   \nEffect of goodwill and other intangibles| (3.02)| (3.10)  \nTangible book value per common share| $| 11.49 | $| 9.98   \nTangible equity to tangible assets reconciliation  \nEquity to assets (GAAP)| 8.35 | %| 7.84 | %  \nEffect of goodwill and other intangibles| (1.62)| (1.74)  \nTangible equity to tangible assets| 6.73 | %| 6.10 | %  \nOperating efficiency ratio calculation  \nEfficiency ratio (GAAP)| 72.94 | %| 77.34 | %  \nSeverance costs| (1.13)| (1.16)  \nAcquisition-related expenses| (0.14)| (0.12)  \nGain on sale of bank premises| 0.32 | —   \nFHLB mark from called borrowings| — | (0.65)  \nOperating efficiency ratio| 71.99 | %| 75.41 | %  \nOperating net noninterest expense(1) to average assets calculation  \nNet noninterest expense to average assets| 1.57 | %| 1.98 | %  \nSeverance costs| (0.04)| (0.05)  \nAcquisition-related expenses| (0.01)| (0.01)  \nGain on sale of bank premises| 0.01 | —   \nOperating net noninterest expense to average assets| 1.53 | %| 1.92 | %  \nPre-provision net revenue  \nNet interest income before provision for credit losses| $| 78,244 | $| 80,672   \nNoninterest income| 35,634 | 35,025   \nTotal income| 113,879 | 115,697   \nNoninterest expense| 83,065 | 89,475   \nPre-provision net revenue| $| 30,814 | $| 26,222   \n(1) Net noninterest expense is defined as noninterest expense less noninterest income.  \n  \n38\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Colony are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the valuation of loan acquisition transactions, as well as the determination of the allowance for credit losses and income taxes and, therefore, are critical accounting policies. In addition to the discussion that follows, the accounting policies related to these estimates are further described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, under Part II, Item 8.\n\nReserve for Credit Losses\n\nA consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of the borrower.\n\nThe reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) and the allowance for unfunded commitments. As a result of our January 1, 2023 adoption of ASU No. 2016-13, and its related amendments, our methodology for estimating the reserve for credit losses changed significantly from December 31, 2022. The standard replaced the “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” approach known as the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”). The CECL approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). It removes the incurred loss approach’s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was “probable” a loss event was “incurred.”\n\nThe estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. The allowance for unfunded commitments represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit. This allowance is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date under the CECL model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur.\n\nManagement’s evaluation of the appropriateness of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk rating we assign to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, reliance on historical loss rates on homogenous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors, and the reliance on our reasonable and supportable forecasts. The reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), local/regional economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, changes in collateral values, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the volume and terms of loans.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe assessment of income tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretation, and judgment concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes. There can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management’s current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings.\n\nColony files a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined state income tax return (both of which include Colony and its wholly owned subsidiaries). Accordingly, amounts equal to tax benefits of those companies having taxable federal losses or credits are reimbursed by the companies that incur federal tax liabilities. Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under \n\n39\n\ntax laws. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed quarterly for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax law rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through provision for income tax expense. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that a portion of the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Colony may also recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertainty in income taxes. Unrecognized tax benefits represent the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured in the financial statements. Penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\n\nOverview\n\nThe following discussion and analysis present the more significant factors affecting the Company’s financial condition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and results of operations for each of the two year-periods ended December 31, 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements, notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report.\n\nTaxable-equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax-free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a 21% federal tax rate for 2023 and 2022, thus making tax-exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields.\n\nDollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands, except for per share amounts.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe Company’s results of operations are determined by its ability to effectively manage interest income and expense, to minimize loan and investment losses, to generate noninterest income and to control noninterest expense. Since market forces and economic conditions beyond the control of the Company determine interest rates, the ability to generate net interest income is dependent upon the Company’s ability to obtain an adequate spread between the rate earned on interest-earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Thus, the key performance for net interest income is the interest margin or net yield, which is taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Net income available to common shareholders totaled $21.7 million, or $1.24 per diluted shares in 2023, compared to $19.5 million, or $1.14 per diluted shares in 2022.\n\nNet Interest Income\n\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, which are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is the Company’s largest component of income, representing 68.7% of total income during 2023 and 69.7% of total income during 2022.\n\nNet interest margin is the taxable-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets for the period. The level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin.\n\nThe Company’s loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime interest rate, which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit, was 8.50% as of December 31, 2023 and 7.50% as of December 31, 2022. The Federal Reserve Board sets general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. During 2023, the prime interest rate increased 1.00%. During 2022, the prime interest rate increased 4.25%. \n\nThe following table presents the changes in taxable-equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities. The changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each. The Company’s consolidated average balance sheets along with an analysis of taxable-equivalent net interest earnings are presented in the Rate/Volume Analysis.\n\n40\n\nRate/Volume Analysis\n\nThe rate/volume analysis presented hereafter illustrates the change from year to year for each component of the taxable equivalent net interest income separated into the amount generated through volume changes and the amount generated by changes in the yields/rates.\n\nChanges from 2022 to 2023 (a)  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Volume| Rate| Total  \nInterest income  \nLoans, net of unearned fees| $| 16,214 | $| 12,354 | $| 28,568   \nInvestment securities, taxable| (1,230)| 4,664 | 3,434   \nInvestment securities, exempt| (68)| 265 | 197   \nDeposits in banks and short-term investments| (272)| 1,726 | 1,454   \nTotal interest income| 14,644 | 19,009 | 33,653   \nInterest expense  \nInterest-bearing demand and savings deposits| (103)| 12,888 | 12,785   \nTime deposits| 1,890 | 14,913 | 16,803   \nFederal funds purchased| (1)| 94 | 93   \nFHLB advances| 3,181 | 1,018 | 4,199   \nOther borrowings| 803 | 1,124 | 1,927   \nTotal interest expense| 5,770 | 30,037 | 35,807   \nNet interest income| $| 8,874 | $| (11,028)| $| (2,154)  \n  \n(a)Changes in net interest income for the periods, based on either changes in average balances or changes in average rates for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, are shown on this table. During each year there are numerous and simultaneous balance and rate changes; therefore, it is not possible to precisely allocate the changes between balances and rates. For the purpose of this table, changes that are not exclusively due to balance changes or rate changes have been attributed to rates.\n\nThe Company maintains about 15.32% of its loan portfolio in adjustable rate loans that reprice with prime rate changes, while a little over half of its other loans mature within 5 years. The liabilities to fund assets are primarily in non-maturing core deposits and short-term certificates of deposit that mature within one year. During 2023, Federal Reserve rates increased 100 basis points. During 2022, Federal Reserve rates increased 425 basis points. We have seen the net interest margin decrease to 2.83% for 2023, compared to 3.20% for 2022 primarily due to increases in rates on interest bearing liabilities outpacing rate increases on interest earning assets.\n\nTaxable-equivalent net interest income for 2023 decreased by $2.2 million or 2.7%, compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in loan volume and rates, offset by increases in deposit rates and increases in borrowings to fund loan growth. The average volume of interest-earning assets during 2023 increased $256.2 million compared to 2022, primarily related to increases in loans. The total yield on interest-earning assets increased year over year with increases in loan volume, partially offset by decreases in investment securities balances along with increased rates on all interest-earning assets.\n\nThe average volume of loans increased $344.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022, which primarily reflects organic loan growth. The average yield on loans increased by 67 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the increased loan volume in addition to the increase in rates. The average volume of interest-bearing deposits increased $199.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022. Average savings and interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $49.0 million offset by an increase in average time deposits of $248.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nAccordingly, the ratio of average interest-bearing deposits to total average deposits was 79.47% in 2023 and 76.23% in 2022. For 2023, this deposit mix, combined with an increase in interest rates, had the effect of increasing the average cost of total deposits by 144 basis points in 2023 compared to 2022. The Company used borrowings to fund loan growth during 2023. The funds borrowed in 2023 were at higher interest rates and were a contributing factor in the increase of 87 basis points in total other interest-bearing liabilities in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\n41\n\nThe Company’s net interest spread, which represents the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, decreased to 2.42% in 2023 from 3.07% in 2022 and was also a result of deposit rate increases and an increase in borrowings, partially offset by increases in loan volume and rates. The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment. A discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in \"Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity\" included elsewhere in this report.\n\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS\n\n2023| 2022  \n---|---  \nAverage| Income/| Yields/| Average| Income/| Yields/  \n(dollars in thousands)| Balances| Expense| Rates| Balances| Expense| Rates  \nAssets  \nLoans, net of unearned fees (1)| $| 1,850,043 | $| 99,472 | 5.38 | %| $| 1,505,792 | $| 70,903 | 4.71 | %  \nInvestment securities, taxable| 770,707 | 21,388 | 2.78 | 827,388 | 17,954 | 2.17   \nInvestment securities, exempt (2)| 105,797 | 2,444 | 2.31 | 109,122 | 2,247 | 2.06   \nDeposits in banks and short-term investments| 63,806 | 2,341 | 3.67 | 91,825 | 887 | 0.97   \nTotal interest-earning assets| 2,790,353 | 125,645 | 4.50 | %| 2,534,127 | 91,991 | 3.63 | %  \nTotal noninterest-earning assets| 226,198 | 215,723   \nTotal assets| $| 3,016,551 | $| 2,749,850   \nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity  \nInterest-bearing liabilities:  \nSavings and interest-bearing demand deposits| $| 1,390,247 | 15,833 | 1.14 | %| $| 1,439,234 | 3,047 | 0.21 | %  \nTime deposits| 619,083 | 19,632 | 3.17 | 370,375 | 2,829 | 0.76   \nTotal interest-bearing deposits| 2,009,330 | 35,465 | 1.76 | 1,809,609 | 5,876 | 0.32   \nFederal funds purchased| 2,783 | 147 | 5.29 | 2,835 | 54 | 1.89   \nFHLB advances (3)| 160,548 | 6,763 | 4.21 | 71,690 | 2,564 | 3.58   \nPaycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility| — | — | — | — | — | —   \nOther borrowings| 70,807 | 4,298 | 6.07 | 52,872 | 2,371 | 4.48   \nTotal other interest-bearing liabilities| 234,138 | 11,208 | 4.79 | 127,397 | 4,989 | 3.92   \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities| 2,243,468 | 46,673 | 2.08 | %| 1,937,006 | 10,865 | 0.56 | %  \nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits| 519,225 | 564,322   \nOther liabilities| 14,947 | 12,173   \nStockholders' equity| 238,911 | 236,349   \nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity| $| 3,016,551 | $| 2,749,850   \nInterest rate spread| 2.42 | %| 3.07 | %  \nNet interest income| $| 78,972 | $| 81,126   \nNet interest margin| 2.83 | %| 3.20 | %  \n  \n(1)The average balance of loans includes the average balance of nonaccrual loans.

The amount of provision expense recorded in each period was the amount required such that the total allowance for credit losses reflected the appropriate balance, in the estimation of management, sufficient to cover expected credit losses over the expected life of a loan exposure and unfunded commitments where the likelihood is that funding will occur. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $3.9 million in provision for credit losses on loans and $286,000 in release of credit losses on unfunded commitments. See the section captioned “Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for credit losses. The increase in provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 is due to downgrades and charge-offs on a small number of loans and does not represent systemic issues across the entire loan portfolio. See the sections captioned “Loans\" and \"Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for credit losses. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $1.6 million compared to $152,000 for the same period in 2022. As of December 31, 2023, Colony’s allowance for credit losses was $18.4 million, or 0.98% of total loans, compared to $16.1 million, or 0.93% of total loans, at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, nonperforming assets were $10.7 million and $6.4 million, or 0.35% and 0.22% of total assets, respectively, with credit quality in the overall loan portfolio remaining strong.\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nThe components of noninterest income were as follows:\n\n$| %  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022| Variance| Variance  \nService charges on deposit accounts| $| 8,735 | $| 7,875 | $| 860 | 10.92 | %  \nMortgage fee income| 6,131 | 8,550 | (2,419)| (28.29)  \nGain on sales of SBA loans| 5,063 | 6,216 | (1,153)| (18.55)  \nGain (loss) on sales of securities| — | (82)| 82 | 100.00   \nInterchange fees| 8,460 | 8,381 | 79 | 0.94   \nBOLI income| 1,396 | 1,313 | 83 | 6.34   \nInsurance commissions| 1,873 | 1,777 | 96 | 5.40   \nOther| 3,976 | 995 | 2,981 | 299.61   \nTotal| $| 35,634 | $| 35,025 | $| 609 | 1.74 | %  \n  \nNoninterest income in 2023 increased $609,000, or 1.74% from 2022. The Company's increases were primarily seen in service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income, which included increases in equity investment income and income on wealth advisory and merchant services. These increases were offset by decreases in mortgage fee income and gain on sales of SBA loans. The increase of $860,000 in service charges on deposit accounts can be attributed to our strong retail banking center footprint and our ability to continue to grow our core deposits despite the challenging rate environment. The increase of $3.0 million in other noninterest income was attributable to equity investment market valuation gains of $156,000 in 2023 compared to market valuation losses of $503,000 in 2022, an increase of $729,000 in wealth advisory and merchant services, gains on sales of assets of $379,000 along with increases in SBA servicing and other related fee income of $656,000. The decrease in mortgage fee income was a result of a reduction in mortgage production and changes in allocation between portfolio and secondary market. The increase in mortgage rates was partially attributable to the 525 basis point increase in the national federal funds rate during 2022 and 2023.\n\n43\n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nThe components of noninterest expense were as follows: \n\n$| %  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022| Variance| Variance  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 49,233 | $| 52,809 | $| (3,576)| (6.77)| %  \nOccupancy and equipment| 6,283 | 6,534 | (251)| (3.83)  \nInformation technology| 8,553 | 9,947 | (1,394)| (14.01)  \nProfessional Fees| 3,097 | 3,432 | (335)| (9.76)  \nAdvertising and public relations| 3,486 | 3,664 | (178)| (4.87)  \nCommunications| 947 | 1,602 | (655)| (40.88)  \nOther| 11,466 | 11,487 | (21)| (0.19)  \nTotal| $| 83,065 | $| 89,475 | $| (6,410)| (7.16)| %  \n  \nDecreases were seen in all categories of noninterest expense. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $3.6 million was primarily attributable to a reduction of force initiative in 2023 along with lower commissions and bonus expenses. The decrease in occupancy and equipment expenses can be seen in decreases in repair and maintenance expense as well as rental and leasehold expenses. The decrease in information technology expenses of $1.4 million relates to a decrease in data processing expenses due to a renewed contract with the Company's core processor resulting in cost savings year over year. The decrease in professional fees is the result of lower consulting and legal fees in 2023 compared to 2022 which included fees associated with the acquisition of SouthCrest Financial Group, Inc. The decrease in advertising and public relations can be attributed to the expense control initiative implemented in 2023. The decrease in communications expense is the result of telephone service contracts related to the acquisition of SouthCrest Financial Group, Inc. that were paid through the end of the contracts in 2022. \n\nSources and Uses of Funds\n\nThe following table illustrates, during the years presented, the mix of the Company’s funding sources and the assets in which those funds are invested as a percentage of the Company’s average total assets for the period indicated.

Loans totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2023, up 8.4% from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The majority of the Company’s loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans. Commercial and residential real estate which is primarily 1-4 family residential properties, nonfarm nonresidential properties and real estate construction loans made up 83.8% and 86.1% of total loans at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Commercial, financial and agriculture loans represents 12.9% of the loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Consumer and other loans increased to 3.3% of total loans at December 31, 2023 from 1.1% at December 31, 2022.\n\nLoan origination/risk management. In accordance with the Company’s decentralized banking model, loan decisions are made at the local bank level. The Company utilizes both an Executive Loan Committee and a Director Loan Committee to assist lenders with the decision making and underwriting process of larger loan requests. Due to the diverse economic markets served by the Company, evaluation and underwriting criterion may vary slightly by market. Overall, loans are extended after a review of the borrower’s repayment ability, collateral adequacy, and overall credit worthiness.\n\n45\n\nCommercial purpose, commercial real estate, and agricultural loans are underwritten similarly to how other loans are underwritten throughout the Company. The properties securing the Company’s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. In addition, the Company restricts total loans to $10 million per borrower, subject to exception and approval by the Director Loan Committee. This diversity helps reduce the Company’s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans monthly based on collateral, geography, and risk grade criteria. The Company also utilizes information provided by third-party agencies to provide additional insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting the markets it serves.\n\nThe Company extends loans to builders and developers that are secured by non-owner occupied properties. In such cases, the Company reviews the overall economic conditions and trends for each market to determine the desirability of loans to be extended for residential construction and development. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre-committed permanent loans from approved long-term lenders, sales of developed property or an interim mini-perm loan commitment from the Company until permanent financing is obtained. In some cases, loans are extended for residential loan construction for speculative purposes and are based on the perceived present and future demand for housing in a particular market served by the Company. These loans are monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, general economic conditions and trends, the demand for the properties, and the availability of long-term financing.\n\nThe Company originates consumer loans at the bank level. Due to the diverse economic markets served by the Company, underwriting criterion may vary slightly by market. The Company is committed to serving the borrowing needs of all markets served and, in some cases, adjusts certain evaluation methods to meet the overall credit demographics of each market. Consumer loans represent relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers to help minimize risk. Additionally, consumer trends and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis.\n\nThe Company utilizes an independent third-party company for loan review and validation of the credit risk program on an ongoing quarterly basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee. The loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel, as well as the Company’s policies and procedures.\n\nFor additional discussion of our loan portfolio and deposit accounts, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Loans\" and \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Deposits.”\n\nCommercial, financial & agricultural. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans at December 31, 2023 increased by $18.8 million, or 8.4% to $242.8 million from December 31, 2022 at $223.9 million. This increase was related to organic growth of commercial and industrial loans. The Company’s commercial, financial and agricultural loans are a diverse group of loans to small, medium and large businesses. The purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment. These agricultural lines typically reduce in size at year end as crops are sold. While some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis, most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with the Company’s loan policy guidelines.\n\nConstruction, land & land development. Construction, land and land development loans increased by $17.7 million, or 7.7%, at December 31, 2023 to $247.1 million from $229.4 million at December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of consumer residential construction loans. \n\nOther commercial real estate. Other commercial real estate loans decreased by $1.1 million, or 0.1%, at December 31, 2023 to $974.4 million from $975.4 million at December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in both owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate and due to the current lending environment, rate environment, and the Company's lending appetite. At December 31, 2023, the Company's other commercial real estate loans were comprised of 60.9% of non-owner occupied loans and 39.1% of owner occupied loans.\n\n46\n\nThe Company's non-owner occupied portfolio is well diversified as can be seen in the table below as of December 31, 2023.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nMultifamily| $| 74,914   \nHotel/Motel| 54,493   \nRetail| 185,909   \nOffice| 68,008   \nIndustrial & Warehouse| 63,538   \nHealth Care| 14,895   \nOther Specialty| 121,006   \nGovernment guaranteed SBSL| 10,713   \nTotal| $| 593,476  \n  \nResidential Real Estate Loans. Residential real estate loans increased by $66.2 million or 22.8%, at December 31, 2023 to $356.2 million from $290.1 million at December 31, 2022. This increase was attributable to growth of portfolio 1-4 family residential real estate loans. Residential real estate loans consist of revolving, open-end and closed-end loans as well as those secured by closed-end first and junior liens.\n\nConsumer and other. Consumer and other loans include loans to individuals for personal and household purposes, including secured and unsecured installment loans and revolving lines of credit. Consumer and other loans at December 31, 2023 increased $44.7 million or 245.0% to $63.0 million from $18.2 million at December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in the Company's marine and RV lending division.\n\nIndustry concentrations. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no concentrations of loans within any single industry in excess of 10% of total loans, as segregated by Standard Industrial Classification code (“SIC code”). The SIC code is a federally designed standard industrial numbering system used by the Company to categorize loans by the borrower’s type of business. The Company has established industry-specific guidelines with respect to maximum loans permitted for each industry with which the Company does business.\n\nCollateral concentrations. Concentrations of credit risk can exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, or certain geographic regions. The Company has a concentration in real estate loans as well as a geographic concentration that could pose an adverse credit risk. At December 31, 2023, approximately 83.8% of the Company’s loan portfolio was concentrated in loans secured by real estate. A substantial portion of borrowers’ ability to honor their contractual obligations is dependent upon the viability of the real estate economic sector. In addition, a large portion of the Company’s foreclosed assets are also located in these same geographic markets, making the recovery of the carrying amount of foreclosed assets susceptible to changes in market conditions. Management continues to monitor these concentrations and has considered these concentrations in its allowance for credit loss analysis. In recent years, we have seen real estate values stabilizing in our markets. The stabilization of rates has resulted in a decrease in the number of loans being classified as impaired over the past several years.\n\nLarge credit relationships. The Company currently operates 34 locations in north, central, south and coastal Georgia and includes metropolitan markets in Fulton, Fayette, Dougherty, Lowndes, Houston, Chatham and Muscogee counties. The Company has also expanded its presence in 2023 into Birmingham, Alabama as well as Tallahassee and the Florida panhandle. As a result, the Company originates and maintains large credit relationships with several commercial customers in the ordinary course of business. The Company considers large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of $5.0 million prior to any portion being sold. Large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of $5.0 million. In addition to the Company’s normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits, the Company’s Executive Loan Committee and Director Loan Committee must approve all new and renewed credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships. At December 31, 2023, our largest 20 relationships consisted of loans and loan commitments, where the total committed balance was $354.1 million with $266.7 million outstanding. At December 31, 2022, our largest 20 relationships had total committed balance of $327.2 million with $227.2 million outstanding.\n\n47\n\nMaturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates. The following table presents the maturity distribution of the Company’s loans at December 31, 2023. The table also presents the portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index such as the prime rate.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| Due in OneYear orLess| After One,but withinFive Years| After FiveYears, but within Fifteen Years| After Fifteen Years| Total  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nLoans with fixed interest rates:  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 104,421 | $| 39,932 | $| 45,049 | $| 12,314 | $| 201,716   \nOther commercial real estate| 69,295 | 447,084 | 382,369 | 34,686 | 933,434   \nTotal commercial real estate| 173,716 | 487,016 | 427,418 | 47,000 | 1,135,150   \nResidential real estate| 12,400 | 64,858 | 47,242 | 68,790 | 193,290   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 44,426 | 95,854 | 56,969 | 6,663 | 203,912   \nConsumer and other| 5,415 | 23,158 | 16,023 | 17,947 | 62,543   \nTotal loans with fixed interest rates, net of unearned fees| 235,957 | 670,886 | 547,652 | 140,400 | 1,594,895   \nLoans with floating interest rates:  \nConstruction, land & land development| 14,125 | 6,850 | 24,455 | — | 45,430   \nOther commercial real estate| 16,240 | 22,837 | 1,864 | — | 40,941   \nTotal commercial real estate| 30,365 | 29,687 | 26,319 | — | 86,371   \nResidential real estate| 30,386 | 17,365 | 115,172 | 21 | 162,944   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 26,492 | 12,352 | — | — | 38,844   \nConsumer and other| 393 | 23 | — | — | 416   \nTotal loans with floating interest rates, net of unearned fees| 87,636 | 59,427 | 141,491 | 21 | 288,575   \nTotal loans, net of unearned fees| $| 323,593 | $| 730,313 | $| 689,143 | $| 140,421 | $| 1,883,470   \n  \nThe Company may renew loans at maturity when requested by a customer whose financial strength appears to support such renewal or when such renewal appears to be in the Company’s best interest. In such instances, the Company generally requires payment of accrued interest and may adjust the rate of interest, require a principal reduction or modify other terms of the loan at the time of renewal.\n\n48\n\nNonperforming Assets and Potential Problem Loans\n\nAsset quality experienced a slight decrease during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the repurchase of the government guaranteed portion of nonperforming loans, which were repurchased as part of the liquidation process and have no expected losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more, repossessed personal property and other real estate owned (\"OREO\"). Nonaccrual loans totaled $9.8 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $4.1 million, or 72.4%, from $5.7 million at December 31, 2022. There were two loans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing at December 31, 2023 and none at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, OREO totaled $448,000, a decrease of $203,000, or 31.2%, compared with $651,000 at December 31, 2022. The change in OREO is primarily the result of four properties added to other real estate totaling $3.1 million offset by $3.3 million from the sale of five OREO properties. At the end of the year ended December 31, 2023, total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 0.35% compared with 0.22% at December 31, 2022.\n\nYear-end nonperforming assets and accruing past due loans were as follows:\n\n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nLoans accounted for on nonaccrual| $| 9,839 | $| 5,706 | $| 5,449   \nLoans accruing past due 90 days or more| 370 | — | —   \nOther real estate foreclosed| 448 | 651 | 281   \nRepossessed assets| — | — | 49   \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 10,657 | $| 6,357 | $| 5,779   \nNonperforming loans by segment  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 85 | $| 149 | $| 31   \nOther commercial real estate| 4,219 | 1,509 | 837   \nResidential real estate| 3,911 | 2,686 | 3,839   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 1,956 | 1,341 | 708   \nConsumer and other| 38 | 21 | 34   \nTotal nonperforming loans| $| 10,209 | $| 5,706 | $| 5,449   \nNonperforming assets as a percentage of:  \nTotal loans, other real estate and foreclosed assets| 0.57 | %| 0.37 | %| 0.43 | %  \nTotal assets| 0.35 | %| 0.22 | %| 0.21 | %  \nNonperforming loans as a percentage of:  \nTotal loans| 0.55 | %| 0.33 | %| 0.41 | %  \nSupplemental data:  \nAccruing past due loans:  \n30-89 days past due| $| 6,069 | $| 1,793 | $| 4,567   \n90 or more days past due| 370 | — | —   \nTotal accruing past due loans| $| 6,439 | $| 1,793 | $| 4,567   \nAllowance for credit losses| $| 18,371 | $| 16,128 | $| 12,910   \nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of:  \nTotal loans| 0.98 | %| 0.93 | %| 0.96 | %  \nNonperforming loans| 179.95 | 282.65 | 236.92   \n  \nNonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more, foreclosed real estate, repossessed assets and nonaccrual securities. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2023 increased 67.6% from December 31, 2022, as a result of the increase in nonaccrual loans and loans accruing past due 90 days or more, offset by a slight decrease in other real estate owned property. \n\n49\n\nGenerally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is 90 days or more past due. For consumer loans, collectability and loss are generally determined before the loan reaches 90 days past due. Accordingly, losses on consumer loans are recorded at the time they are determined. Consumer loans that are 90 days or more past due are generally either in liquidation/payment status or bankruptcy awaiting confirmation of a plan. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.\n\nThe Company had two loans modified due to financial difficulty during the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 3. Loans, for additional details on loan modifications.\n\nForeclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans. Foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. Write-downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for credit losses. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations. Write-downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non-interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses for loans is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses is based on management's evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of non-performing and past due loans, historical trends of charged-off loans and recoveries, prevailing economic conditions and other factors management deems appropriate. The Company's management has established an allowance for credit losses for loans which it believes is adequate to cover expected credit losses over the expected life of a loan exposure and unfunded commitments where the likelihood is that funding will occur. Based on a credit evaluation of the loan portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses for loans and allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments to the Company's Board of Directors, which primarily focuses on risk by evaluating individual loans in certain risk categories. These categories have also been established by management and take the form of loan grades. By grading the loan portfolio in this manner, the Company's management is able to effectively evaluate the portfolio by risk, which management believes is the most effective way to analyze the loan portfolio and thus analyze the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans is established by examining (1) the large classified loans, nonaccrual loans and loans considered impaired and evaluating them individually to determine the specific reserve allocation and (2) the remainder of the loan portfolio to allocate a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions for the particular loan category. The Company also considers other factors such as changes in lending policies and procedures; changes in national, regional and/or local economic and business conditions; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; changes in the experience, ability and depth of either the market president or lending staff; changes in the volume and severity of past due and classified loans; changes in the quality of the loan review system; and other factors management deems appropriate. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The ACL is calculated using the same aggregate reserve rates calculated for the funded portion of loans at the portfolio level applied to the amount of commitments expected to fund.\n\nManagement evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses for each of these components on a quarterly basis. Peer comparisons, industry comparisons, and regulatory guidelines are also used in the determination of the valuation allowance. Loans identified as losses by management, internal loan review, and/or bank examiners are charged off. Additional information about the Company’s allowance for credit losses is provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Allowance for Credit Losses.\n\nThe following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for credit losses on loans by loan category for the periods indicated. The allocation of the allowance to each category is subjective and is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category.\n\n50\n\nDecember 31,| December 31,| December 31,| December 31,| December 31,  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022| 2021| 2020| 2019  \nReserve| %(1)| Reserve| %(1)| Reserve| %(1)| Reserve| %(1)| Reserve| %(1)  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 2,204 | 13.1 | %| $| 1,959 | 13.2 | %| $| 1,127 | 12.4 | %| $| 1,013 | 11.4 | %| $215| 9.9 | %  \nOther commercial real estate| 7,064 | 51.7 | 8,886 | 56.1 | 7,691 | 58.8 | 6,880 | 49.1 | 3,908 | 55.8   \nResidential real estate| 5,105 | 18.9 | 2,354 | 16.7 | 1,805 | 15.9 | 2,278 | 17.3 | 980 | 20.1   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 2,110 | 12.9 | 2,709 | 12.9 | 1,083 | 11.5 | 1,713 | 20.1 | 1,657 | 11.8   \nConsumer and other| 1,888 | 3.4 | 220 | 1.1 | 1,204 | 1.4 | 243 | 2.1 | 103 | 2.4   \n$| 18,371 | 100.0 | %| $| 16,128 | 100.0 | %| $| 12,910 | 100.0 | %| $| 12,127 | 100.0 | %| $| 6,863 | 100.0 | %  \n  \n(1) Percentage represents the loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total end of period loans.\n\nThe following table presents an analysis of the Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans for the periods indicated.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022| 2021| 2020| 2019  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans at beginning of year| $| 16,128 | $| 12,910 | $| 12,127 | $| 6,863 | $| 7,277   \nAdoption of ASU 2016-13| (53)| — | — | — | —   \nCharge-offs  \nConstruction, land & land development| — | — | — | 4 | 29   \nOther commercial real estate| 69 | 58 | 568 | 226 | 119   \nResidential real estate| 771 | 48 | 3 | 206 | 758   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 1,069 | 314 | 274 | 242 | 403   \nConsumer and other| 35 | 60 | 68 | 1,103 | 784   \nTotal charge-offs| 1,944 | 480 | 913 | 1,781 | 2,093   \nRecoveries  \nConstruction, land & land development| 10 | 25 | 466 | 45 | 82   \nOther commercial real estate| 42 | 85 | 118 | 153 | 218   \nResidential real estate| 79 | 50 | 274 | 142 | 174   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 201 | 139 | 91 | 43 | 36   \nConsumer and other| 22 | 29 | 47 | 104 | 65   \nTotal recoveries| 354 | 328 | 996 | 487 | 575   \nNet charge-offs/(recoveries)| 1,590 | 152 | (83)| 1,294 | 1,518   \nProvision for credit losses on loans| 3,886 | 3,370 | 700 | 6,558 | 1,104   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans at end of year| $| 18,371 | $| 16,128 | $| 12,910 | $| 12,127 | $| 6,863   \nRatio of net charge-offs/(recoveries) to average loans| 0.09 | %| 0.01 | %| (0.01)| %| 0.12 | %| 0.11 | %  \n  \nThe allowance for credit losses on loans increased from $16.1 million or 0.93% of total loans at December 31, 2022 to $18.4 million, or 0.98% of total loans at December 31, 2023. The provision for credit losses on loans reflects loan quality trends, including the level of net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors. The primary reason for the increase year over year was due to a few loans that faced downgrades and charge-offs. These loans represented a small number of loans and circumstances, and management has no concern that there are systemic issues across the portfolio. \n\nThe amount of provision expense recorded in 2023 was the amount required such that the total allowance for credit losses reflected the appropriate balance, in the estimation of management, that was sufficient to cover expected credit losses on loans \n\n51\n\nover the expected life of a loan exposure and unfunded commitments where the likelihood is that funding will occur. The amount of provision expense recorded in 2022 and prior periods was the amount required such that the total allowance for credit losses reflected the appropriate balance, in the estimation of management, sufficient to cover probable, inherent losses in the loan portfolio. \n\nInvestment Portfolio\n\nThe following table presents carrying values of investment securities available-for-sale held by the Company as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nU.S. treasury securities| $| 498 | $| 1,622 | $| 87,551   \nU.S. agency securities| 4,139 | 4,585 | 17,781   \nAsset backed securities| 24,630 | 29,988 | —   \nState, county and municipal securities| 109,036 | 104,756 | 250,153   \nCorporate debt securities| 47,390 | 49,585 | 48,408   \nMortgage-backed securities| 221,689 | 242,017 | 534,271   \nTotal debt securities | $| 407,382 | $| 432,553 | $| 938,164   \n  \nThe following table presents investment securities held-to-maturity, carried at cost by the Company as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---|---  \nU.S. treasury securities| $| 93,306 | $| 91,615 | $| —   \nU.S. agency securities| 16,282 | 16,409 | —   \nState, county and municipal securities| 136,685 | 136,138 | —   \nMortgage-backed securities| 202,758 | 221,696 | —   \nTotal debt securities | $| 449,031 | $| 465,858 | $| —   \n  \nThe following table represents expected maturities and weighted-average yields of investment securities held by the Company as of December 31, 2023 (mortgage-backed securities are based on the average life at the projected speed, while State and Political Subdivisions reflect anticipated calls being exercised).\n\nAfter 1 Year But| After 5 Years But  \n---|---  \nAvailable for Sale| Within 1 Year| Within 5 Years| Within 10 Years| After 10 Years  \n(dollars in thousands)| Amount| Yield| Amount| Yield| Amount| Yield| Amount| Yield  \nU.S. treasury securities| $| 498 | 2.91 | %| $| — | — | %| $| — | — | %| $| — | — | %  \nU.S. agency securities| — | — | 888 | 0.76 | 875 | 2.43 | 2,376 | 2.89   \nAsset backed securities| — | — | 52 | 1.33 | 5,933 | 6.11 | 18,645 | 6.80   \nState, county and municipal securities| 215 | 5.48 | 4,059 | 1.49 | 46,085 | 2.05 | 58,677 | 2.10   \nCorporate debt securities| — | — | 9,698 | 4.80 | 35,746 | 4.34 | 1,946 | 11.12   \nMortgage-backed securities| 20,887 | 7.53 | 41,940 | 3.45 | 6,775 | 1.94 | 152,087 | 2.47   \nTotal debt securities| $| 21,600 | 7.40 | %| $| 56,637 | 3.50 | %| $| 95,414 | 3.16 | %| $| 233,731 | 2.80 | %  \n  \n52\n\nAfter 1 Year But| After 5 Years But  \n---|---  \nHeld to Maturity| Within 1 Year| Within 5 Years| Within 10 Years| After 10 Years  \n(dollars in thousands)| Amount| Yield| Amount| Yield| Amount| Yield| Amount| Yield  \nU.S. treasury securities| $| 3,937 | 1.21 | %| $| 84,506 | 1.05 | %| $| 4,863 | 1.33 | %| $| — | — | %  \nU.S. agency securities| — | — | 7,838 | 1.17 | 8,444 | 1.47 | — | —   \nState, county and municipal securities| — | — | 1,850 | 1.06 | 63,222 | 2.20 | 71,613 | 1.94   \nMortgage-backed securities| — | — | 24,115 | 1.74 | 45,058 | 1.95 | 133,585 | 2.13   \nTotal debt securities| $| 3,937 | 1.21 | %| $| 118,309 | 1.20 | %| $| 121,587 | 2.02 | %| $| 205,198 | 2.06 | %  \n  \nSecurities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity.

Securities available for sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. The Company had both held to maturity and available for sale securities in the investment portfolio at December 31, 2023. Management also evaluates its securities portfolio for any credit-related impairment on a quarterly basis. The Company did not identify any credit-related impairment in its held to maturity or available for sale portfolios at December 31, 2023.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, there were no holdings of any one issuer, other than the U.S. government and its agencies, in an amount greater than 10% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity.\n\nThe average yield of the securities portfolio was 2.72% in 2023 and 2.16% in 2022. The increase in the average yield from 2022 to 2023 was primarily attributed to paydowns of lower yielding investments and repricing of variable rate securities. \n\nDeposits\n\nThe following table presents the average amount outstanding and the average rate paid on deposits by the Company for the years 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n\n2023| 2022| 2021  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| AverageAmount| Average Rate | Average Amount| Average Rate | Average Amount| Average Rate   \nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits| $| 519,225 | — | $| 564,322 | — | $| 449,445 | —   \nInterest-bearing demand and savings deposits| 1,390,247 | 1.14 | %| 1,439,234 | 0.21 | %| 1,073,824 | 0.09 | %  \nTime deposits| 619,083 | 3.17 | %| 370,375 | 0.76 | %| 297,704 | 0.56 | %  \nTotal deposits| $| 2,528,555 | 1.40 | %| $| 2,373,931 | 0.25 | %| $| 1,820,973 | 0.14 | %  \n  \nThe following table presents the maturities of the Company’s time deposits as of December 31, 2023.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| TimeDeposits$250,000 or Greater| TimeDepositsLess than $250,000| Total  \n---|---|---|---  \nMonths to Maturity  \n3 months or less| $| 29,203 | $| 150,150 | $| 179,353   \nOver 3 months through 6 months| 67,382 | 121,717 | 189,099   \nOver 6 months through 12 months| 54,580 | 125,802 | 180,382   \nOver 12 months| 16,515 | 60,839 | 77,354   \n$| 167,680 | $| 458,508 | $| 626,188   \n  \n53\n\nAverage deposits increased $154.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in 2023 included $248.7 million, or 67.2% in time deposits, which were partially offset by decreases in interest-bearing demand and savings deposits of $49.0 million, or 3.4% and noninterest-bearing deposits of $45.1 million, or 8.0%. The increase in our overall deposits is due primarily to the increase in the rate the Company offers on its time deposit products as well as the increase in brokered deposits. The increase in deposit rates is attributable to the 100 basis point increase in the national federal funds rate during 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, $777.8 million and $882.2 million, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting requirements. \n\nThe Company supplements deposit sources with brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $93.6 million, or 3.68% of total deposits, in brokered certificates of deposit attracted by external third parties. Additional information is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for Deposits.\n\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, our Bank has granted commitments to extend credit to approved customers. Generally, these commitments to extend credit have been granted on a temporary basis for seasonal or inventory requirements or for construction period financing and have been approved within the Bank’s credit guidelines. Our Bank has also granted commitments to approved customers for financial standby letters of credit. These commitments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the financial instruments become payable. The Bank uses the same credit policies for these off-balance-sheet commitments as it does for financial instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\n\nThe following table summarizes commitments and contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2023.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| Payments Due by Period  \n---|---  \nTotal| Less Than 1Year| 1 – 3 Years| 3 – 5 Years| More Than 5 Years  \nContractual Obligations:  \nBorrowings| $| 238,445 | $| 70,000 | $| 25,000 | $| 80,000 | $| 63,445   \nOperating lease liabilities| 1,967| 642 | 956 | 369 | —   \nTime Deposits| 626,188| 548,834 | 67,891 | 9,195 | 268   \n$| 866,600 | $| 619,476 | $| 93,847 | $| 89,564 | $| 63,713   \nOther Commitments:  \nLoan commitments| $| 362,878 | $| 172,757 | $| 51,873 | $| 11,930 | $| 126,318   \nStandby letters of credit| 5,656 | 4,702 | 954 | — | —   \n368,534 | 177,459 | 52,827 | 11,930 | 126,318   \nTotal Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments| $| 1,235,134 | $| 796,935 | $| 146,674 | $| 101,494 | $| 190,031   \n  \nLoan Commitments. The Company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of the Company’s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. The Company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. Management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses. Loan commitments outstanding at December 31, 2023 are included in the preceding table.\n\nStandby Letters of Credit. Letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, the Company would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the \n\n54\n\ncommitment is funded, the Company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. The Company’s policies generally require that standby letters of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements. Standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2023 are included in the preceding table.\n\nCapital Requirements\n\nThe Bank and the Company are each required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. For more information, see “Item 1. Business – Supervision and Regulation – Regulation of the Company – Capital Requirements.”\n\nAt December 31, 2023, shareholders’ equity totaled $254.9 million compared to $230.3 million at December 31, 2022. In addition to net income of $21.7 million, another significant change in shareholders’ equity during 2023 included $7.7 million of dividends declared on common stock. The accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders’ equity totaled $55.6 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $66.4 million at December 31, 2022. This fluctuation was mostly related to the after-tax effect of changes in the fair value of securities available for sale. Under regulatory requirements, the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale does not increase or reduce regulatory capital and is not included in the calculation of risk-based capital and leverage ratios. Regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure Tier 1 and total capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items.\n\nTier 1 capital consists of common stock and qualifying preferred securities less goodwill, intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets. Tier 2 capital consists of certain convertible, subordinated and other qualifying debt and the allowance for credit losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. The Company's Tier 2 capital consists of subordinated notes and the allowance for credit losses.\n\nUsing the capital requirements presently in effect, the Tier 1 ratio as of December 31, 2023 was 12.77% and total Tier 1 and 2 risk-based capital was 15.47%. Both of these measures compare favorably with the regulatory minimum of 6.0% for Tier 1 and 8% for total risk-based capital. The Company’s common equity Tier 1 ratio as of December 31, 2023 was 11.66%, which exceeds the regulatory minimum of 4.50%. The Company’s Tier 1 leverage ratio as of December 31, 2023 was 9.17%, which exceeds the required ratio standard of 4.0%.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, average capital was $238.9 million representing 7.9% of average assets for the year. This compares to average capital of $236.3 million, representing 8.6% of average assets for 2022.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.\n\nThe Company granted 55,210 and 139,720 restricted shares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. All restricted shares vest over a three year period.\n\nA cash dividend of $7.7 million and $7.2 million was paid for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nLiquidity\n\nThe Company, primarily through the actions of its subsidiary bank, engages in liquidity management to ensure adequate cash flow for deposit withdrawals, credit commitments and repayments of borrowed funds. Needs are met through loan repayments, net interest and fee income and the sale or maturity of existing assets. In addition, liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits, the renewal of maturing deposits and external borrowings.\n\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $83.3 million and $80.7 million, respectively. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to increases in deposits and other borrowings needed to fund loan growth. \n\n55\n\nManagement believes the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the Company’s liquidity needs in these unsettled times without any material adverse impact on our operating results.\n\nManagement monitors deposit flow and evaluates alternate pricing structures to retain and grow deposits. To the extent needed to fund loan demand, traditional local deposit funding sources are supplemented by the use of FHLB borrowings, brokered deposits and other wholesale deposit sources outside the immediate market area. Internal policies have been updated to monitor the use of various core and non-core funding sources, and to balance ready access with risk and cost. Through various asset/liability management strategies, a balance is maintained among goals of liquidity, safety and earnings potential. Internal policies that are consistent with regulatory liquidity guidelines are monitored and enforced by the Bank.\n\nThe investment portfolio provides a ready means to raise cash if liquidity needs arise. As of December 31, 2023, the available-for-sale bond portfolio totaled $407.4 million. At December 31, 2022, the available for sale bond portfolio totaled $432.6 million. This decrease is primarily attributable to maturities, calls and paydowns on the portfolio during 2023. Only marketable investment grade bonds are purchased. Although approximately 50.2% of the Bank’s bond portfolio is encumbered as pledges to secure various public funds deposits, repurchase agreements, and for other purposes, management can restructure and free up investment securities for sale if required to meet liquidity needs.\n\nManagement continually monitors the relationship of loans to deposits as it primarily determines the Company’s liquidity posture. Colony had ratios of loans to deposits of 74.0% as of December 31, 2023 and 69.7% as of December 31, 2022. Management employs alternative funding sources when deposit balances will not meet loan demands. The ratios of loans to all funding sources (excluding Subordinated Debentures) at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were 69.3% and 66.0%, respectively. Management continues to emphasize programs to generate local core deposits as our Company’s primary funding sources. The stability of the Banks’ core deposit base is an important factor in Colony’s liquidity position. A heavy percentage of the deposit base is comprised of accounts of individuals and small businesses with comprehensive banking relationships and limited volatility. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank had $167.7 million and $114.8 million, respectively, in certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more. These larger deposits represented 6.6% and 4.6% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Management seeks to monitor and control the use of these larger certificates, which tend to be more volatile in nature, to ensure an adequate supply of funds as needed. Relative interest costs to attract local core relationships are compared to market rates of interest on various external deposit sources to help minimize the Company’s overall cost of funds.\n\nThe Company supplemented deposit sources with brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $93.6 million or 3.68% of total deposits in brokered deposits. Additional information is provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding these brokered deposits. Additionally, the Company uses external deposit listing services to obtain out-of-market certificates of deposit at competitive interest rates when funding is needed. The deposits obtained from listing services are often referred to as wholesale or internet CDs. \n\nTo plan for contingent sources of funding not satisfied by both local and out-of-market deposit balances, Colony and its subsidiary have established multiple borrowing sources to augment their funds management. The Company has borrowing capacity through membership of the Federal Home Loan Bank program. The Bank has also established overnight borrowing for Federal Funds Purchased through various correspondent banks. Management believes the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the Company’s liquidity needs in the future without any material adverse impact on operating results. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $175.0 million and $125.0 million, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. Based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had $596.2 million and $574.9 million of additional borrowing availability with the FHLB at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\nOther sources of liquidity include overnight borrowings from the Federal Reserve Discount Window, as well as access to the FRB Term Funding Program which offers loans to eligible depository institutions of up to one year in length. The Company also has unencumbered investment securities which provide the ability to either be pledged as collateral with borrowing sources or sold and converted to cash.\n\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure, the ability to liquidate assets, and the availability of alternative sources of funds. The Company seeks to ensure its funding needs are met by maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset/liability management.\n\n56\n\nAsset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, securities available for sale and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements.\n\nLiability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits. Should the need arise, the Company also maintains relationships with the Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, three correspondent banks and repurchase agreement lines that can provide funds on short notice.\n\nSince Colony is a bank holding Company and does not conduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are dividends up streamed from the subsidiary bank and borrowings from outside sources.\n\nThe liquidity position of the Company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nThe Company’s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). GAAP presently requires the Company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. The primary effect of inflation on the operations of the Company is reflected in increased operating costs, and the Company has experienced material effects of inflation during the last three fiscal years due to the government's monetary policies and the current economic climate. In management’s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the Company, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities, among other things, as further discussed in the next section.\n\nRegulatory and Economic Policies\n\nThe Company’s business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities, among other things. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve Board are (i) conducting open market operations in United States government obligations, (ii) changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings, (iii) imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits, and (iv) restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by financial institutions and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. For that reason alone, the policies of the Federal Reserve Board have a material effect on the earnings of the Company.\n\nGovernmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future; however, the Company cannot accurately predict the nature, timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on its future business and earnings.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nMarket Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity\n\nOur financial performance is impacted by, among other factors, interest rate risk and credit risk. We utilize derivatives to help manage our interest rate risk position and mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. We mitigate our credit risk through reliance on an extensive loan review process and our allowance for credit losses.\n\n57\n\nInterest rate risk is the change in value due to changes in interest rates. The Company is exposed only to U.S. dollar interest rate changes and, accordingly, the Company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin. The Company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of its investment portfolio as held for trading. The Company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and other market risks. Interest rate risk is addressed by our Risk Management Committee which includes senior management representatives. The Risk Management Committee monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact to the net portfolio of equity value and net interest income from potential changes to interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure.\n\nInterest rates play a major part in the net interest income of financial institutions. The repricing of interest earnings assets and interest-bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income. The timing of repriced assets and liabilities is Gap management and our Company has established its policy to maintain a Gap ratio in the one-year time horizon of .80 to 1.20.\n\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by our Board of Directors and by our Risk Management Committee. Interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine our change in net portfolio value in the event of assumed changes in interest rates. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we have implemented strategies to more closely match our balance sheet composition. The Company has engaged Stifel to run a quarterly asset/liability model for interest rate risk analysis. We are generally focusing our investment activities on securities with terms or average lives in the 3 ½ - 5 ½ year range.\n\nMarket risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. This risk of loss can be reflected in either reduced current market values or reduced current and potential net income. Colony’s most significant market risk is interest rate risk. This risk arises primarily from Colony’s extension of loans and acceptance of deposits.\n\nManaging interest rate risk is a primary goal of the asset liability management function. Colony attempts to achieve stability in net interest income while limiting volatility arising from changes in interest rates. Colony seeks to achieve this goal by balancing the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. Colony manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by the Risk Management Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee meets at least quarterly and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policies, reviewing the interest rate sensitivity of Colony, and developing and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet structure and interest rate risk positioning.\n\nColony measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the utilization of Asset/Liability simulation modeling. On at least a quarterly basis, the following twenty-four month time period is simulated to determine a baseline net interest income forecast and the sensitivity of this forecast to changes in interest rates. These simulations include all of Colony’s earning assets and liabilities. Forecasted balance sheet changes, primarily reflecting loan and deposit growth and forecasts, are included in the periods modeled. Projected rates for loans and deposits are based on management’s outlook and local market conditions.\n\nThe magnitude and velocity of rate changes among the various asset and liability groups exhibit different characteristics for each possible interest rate scenario; additionally, customer loan and deposit preferences can vary in response to changing interest rates. Simulation modeling enables Colony to capture the expected effect of these differences. Assumptions utilized in the model are updated on an ongoing basis and are reviewed and approved by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nColony has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the Federal Reserve's targeted range of 5.25% and the prime rate of 8.50% at December 31, 2023. Colony has modeled the impact of a gradual increase in short-term rates of 100 and 200 basis points and a decline of 100 basis points to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months. As illustrated in the table below, the net interest income sensitivity model indicates that, compared with a net interest income forecast assuming stable rates, net interest income is projected to increase by 0.54% and 0.97% if interest rates increased by 100 and 200 basis points, respectively. Net interest income is projected to decline by 2.03% if interest rates decreased by 100 basis points. These changes were within Colony’s policy limit of a maximum 15% negative change.\n\n58\n\nTwelve Month Net Interest Income Sensitivity  \n---  \nEstimated Change in Net Interest Income as of December 31,  \nChange in Short-term Interest Rates(in basis points)| 2023| 2022  \n+200| 0.97%| 2.59%  \n+100| 0.54%| 1.37%  \nFlat| —%| —%  \n-100| 2.03%| -0.61%  \n  \nThe measured interest rate sensitivity indicates an asset sensitive position over the next year, which could serve to improve net interest income in a rising interest rate environment. The actual realized change in net interest income would depend on several factors, some of which could serve to reduce or eliminate the asset sensitivity noted above. These factors include a higher than projected level of deposit customer migration to higher cost deposits, such as certificates of deposit, which would increase total interest expense and serve to reduce the realized level of asset sensitivity. Another factor which could impact the realized interest rate sensitivity in a rising rate environment is the repricing behavior of interest-bearing non-maturity deposits. Assumptions for repricing are expressed as a beta relative to the change in the prime rate. For instance, a 25% beta would correspond to a deposit rate that would increase 0.25% for every 1% increase in the prime rate. Projected betas for interest bearing non-maturity deposit repricing are a key component of determining the Company's interest rate risk position. Should realized betas be higher than projected betas, the expected benefit from higher interest rates would be reduced.\n\nColony is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines. Mortgage banking income is subject to market risk. Mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore, mortgage banking income could be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates. The extension of commitments to customers to fund mortgage loans also subjects Colony to market risk. This risk is primarily created by the time period between making the commitment and closing and delivering the loan. Colony seeks to minimize this exposure by utilizing various risk management tools, the primary of which are forward sales commitments and best efforts commitments. \n\nItem 7A\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nThe information required by this item is located in Item 7 under the heading Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity.\n\nItem 8\n\nFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data\n\n59\n\nMANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThe management of Colony Bankcorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and affected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n•Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n\n•Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n\n•Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Management also conducted an assessment of requirements pertaining to Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. This section relates to management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, including controls over the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) and in compliance with laws and regulations. Our evaluation included a review of the documentation of controls, evaluations of the design of the internal control system and tests of the effectiveness of internal controls.\n\nBased on our assessment, management concluded that as of December 31, 2023, Colony Bankcorp, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Mauldin and Jenkins, LLC, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n\n/s/ T. Heath Fountain  \n---  \nT. Heath FountainChief Executive Officer/Director  \n  \n/s/ Derek Shelnutt \n\nDerek Shelnutt\n\nExecutive Vice President/Chief Financial Officer\n\n60\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\n\nColony Bankcorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries\n\nFitzgerald, Georgia\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Colony Bankcorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 14, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements.The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n61\n\nAllowance for credit losses\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAs described in Note 4 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company has a gross loan portfolio of $1.9 billion and related allowance for credit losses of $18.4 million as of December 31, 2023. As described by the Company in Note 1, the Company computes quantitative and qualitative components for the allowance for credit losses. The quantitative component is evaluated on a collective (pool) basis, segregated by class of loans (the quantitative collective ACL). The Company estimated the quantitative collective ACL utilizing a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology applied to their loan pools segregated by similar risk characteristics. The Company’s DCF methodology generates cash flow projections at the loan level wherein payment expectations are adjusted for estimated prepayment speeds, curtailments, time to recovery, probability of default (PD), and loss given default (LGD). The modeling of expected prepayment speeds and curtailment rates are based on historical internal data and consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. The Company uses regression analysis of historical internal and peer loss data to determine suitable macroeconomic variables to utilize when modeling lifetime PD and LGD. This analysis also determines how expected PD and LGD will react to forecasted levels of the macroeconomic variables over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. At the end of the four-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to a historical loss rate on a straight-line basis over eight quarters. For loans that have elevated risk characteristics when compared to the collectively pooled loans, they are evaluated on an individual basis.\n\nThe qualitative component is comprised of measurements used to quantify the risks within each of these loans classes and are subjectively selected by management but measured by objective measurements period over period. The data for each measurement is obtained from internal and external sources. These adjustments are based upon quarterly trend assessments in certain economic factors as well as loan segment specific risks that cannot be addressed in the quantitative methods.\n\nWe identified the Company’s estimate of the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination of the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter related to the subjective and complex auditor judgment involved in the assessment of the quantitative collective ACL due to significant measurement uncertainty and the high degree of subjectivity in the Company’s judgments in determining the qualitative factors. Auditing these complex judgments and assumptions by the Company involves especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit evidence and effort required to address these matters, including the extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed.\n\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n\n•We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s determination of the allowance for credit losses, including controls over development of the quantitative and qualitative factors.\n\n•We evaluated the Company’s allowance for credit losses methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n•We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to management’s review of reliability and accuracy of data used to calculate and estimate the various components of the allowance for credit losses, including accuracy of the calculation and validation procedures over the models. \n\n•We evaluated the relevance and the reasonableness of assumptions related to evaluation of the loan portfolio, current and forecasted economic conditions, and other risk factors used in development of the qualitative factors.\n\n•We evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions and data used by the Company in developing the qualitative factors by comparing these data points to internally developed and third-party sources, and other audit evidence gathered. \n\n•We assessed the overall trends in credit quality by comparing the overall allowance for credit losses to those recorded by the Company’s peer institutions.\n\n•We evaluated subsequent events and transactions and considered whether they corroborated or contradicted the Company’s conclusion.\n\n/s/ Mauldin & Jenkins, LLC\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\n\nAlbany, Georgia\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n62\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\n\nColony Bankcorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries\n\nFitzgerald, Georgia\n\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited Colony Bankcorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. \n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Colony Bankcorp, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements) and our report dated March 14, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion. \n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Mauldin & Jenkins, LLC\n\nAlbany, Georgia\n\nMarch 14, 2024\n\n63\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNOTE 1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nNature of Business\n\nColony Bankcorp, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a financial holding company headquartered in Fitzgerald, Georgia, whose primary business is presently conducted by Colony Bank, its wholly owned banking subsidiary (the “Bank”). The Company operates locations throughout Georgia and has expanded its presence in 2023 to serve Birmingham, Alabama, as well as Tallahassee and the Florida Panhandle. Through the Bank, the Company offers a broad range of banking solutions for personal and business customers. In addition to traditional banking services, the Bank provides specialized solutions including mortgage, government guaranteed lending, wealth management, and merchant services. The Company also provides an option for its customers to purchase insurance services including vehicle, home, renters and life insurance. Additionally, Colony Risk Management, Inc. is a subsidiary of the Company and is located in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is a captive insurance subsidiary which insures various liability and property damage policies for the Company and its related subsidiaries. Colony Risk Management is regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance. The Company is subject to the regulations of certain state and federal agencies and are periodically examined by those regulatory agencies.\n\nBasis of Presentation and Accounting Estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Colony Bankcorp, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Colony Bank and Colony Risk Management. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nTransfer of Financial Assets\n\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Company, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nFor purposes of reporting cash flow, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in process of collection, amounts due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in banks and federal funds sold.\n\nInvestment Securities\n\nThe Company classifies its debt securities in one of three categories: (i) trading, (ii) held to maturity or (iii) available for sale. Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Held to maturity securities are those securities for which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. All other debt securities are classified as available for sale. As of the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, debt securities were classified as either held to maturity or available for sale.\n\nAvailable for sale securities are carried at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related deferred tax effect, on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity until realized. Held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Transfers of securities between categories are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer. Unrealized holding gains or losses associated with transfers of securities from held to maturity to available for sale are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. These unrealized holding gains or losses are amortized into income over the remaining life of the security as an adjustment to the yield in a manner consistent with the amortization or accretion of the original purchase premium or discount on the associated security.\n\n70\n\nThe amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the expected life of the securities. Realized gains and losses, determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold, are included in earnings on the trade date. The Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of debt securities and report accrued interest in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. A debt security is placed on nonaccrual status at the time any principal or interest payments become more than 90 days delinquent or if full collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. Accrued interest for a security placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. There was no accrued interest related to debt securities reversed against interest income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Accrued interest receivable on debt securities totaled $4.3 million and $4.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n\nThe Company evaluates available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position to determine if credit-related impairment exists. The Company first evaluates whether it intends to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell an impaired security before recovering its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the entire amount of unrealized loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security's amortized cost basis. If either of the above criteria is not met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is attributable to credit or resulted from other factors. If credit-related impairment exists, the Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\"), limited to the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment not recognized through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax, as a non credit-related impairment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $407.4 million and $432.6 million available for sale securities, respectively, with no related allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe Company uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for debt securities held to maturity considering the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the portfolio. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the held to maturity portfolio. The Company monitors the held to maturity portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation account would need to be recorded. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $449.0 million and $465.9 million held to maturity securities, respectively, with no related allowance for credit losses. \n\nOther Investments\n\nOther investments include managed investment funds which are carried at their fair value and unrealized gains or losses are recorded through earnings as a component of noninterest income. \n\nFederal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and First National Bankers Bank (\"FNBB\") stock are also included in other investments. These investments do not have a readily determinable market value due to restrictions placed on transferability and therefore are carried at cost. \n\nThese other investments are periodically evaluated for credit-related impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value or cost basis. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.\n\nLoans Held for Sale\n\nMortgage and SBA loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from third party investors in the secondary market. Adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale of the mortgage loans held for sale are classified as mortgage fee income in the consolidated statements of income. Adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of SBA loans held for sale and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale of the SBA loans held for sale are classified as gain on sale of SBA loans in the consolidated statements of income. \n\nServicing Rights\n\nWhen mortgage and SBA loans are sold withservicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in mortgage banking activity or gain on sale of SBA loans accordingly. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. \n\n71\n\nServicing fee income, which is reported on the income statement in mortgage banking activity for serviced mortgage loans and other noninterest income for all other serviced loans, is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income.\n\nServicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amount. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into strata based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized for a particular stratum through a valuation allowance, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular stratum, a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income. Changes in valuation allowances related to servicing rights are reported in mortgage banking activity and other noninterest income on the income statement. \n\nThe Company's servicing rights are a result of SBA loans that are sold with servicing retained and are recorded at fair value and follow the amortization method. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $2.3 million and $1.9 million in servicing rights, respectively, and no related valuation allowance.\n\nLoans\n\nLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances less unearned income, net of deferred fees and origination costs. Interest income is accrued on the outstanding principal balance. For all classes of loans, the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to make payments as they become due, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether such loans are considered past due. All interest accrued, but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off, is reversed against interest income. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is applied against principal until the loans are returned to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses (\"ACL\") – Loans\n\nThe current expected credit loss (“CECL”) approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). It replaced the incurred loss approach’s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred. The estimate of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. The Company then considers whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the historical period used. The Company also considers future economic conditions and portfolio performance as part of a reasonable and supportable forecast period.\n\nThe ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the ACL when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nManagement determines the ACL balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit behaviors along with model judgments provide the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to modeled loss estimates may be made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in economic conditions, property values, or other relevant factors. For the majority of loans and leases the ACL is calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology applied at a loan level with a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and a two-year straight-line reversion period.\n\nThe ACL-loans is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company has identified the following portfolio segments and calculates the ACL for each using a discounted cash flow methodology at the loan level, with loss rates, prepayment assumptions and curtailment assumptions driven by each loan’s collateral type:\n\n72\n\n•Construction, land & land development - Risks common to construction, land & development loans are cost overruns, changes in market demand for property, inadequate long-term financing arrangements and declines in real estate values.\n\n•Other commercial real estate - Loans in this category are susceptible to business failures and declines in general economic conditions, including declines in real estate value, declines in occupancy rates, and lack of suitable alternative use for the property.\n\n•Residential real estate - Residential real estate loans are susceptible to weakening general economic conditions, increases in unemployment rates and declining real estate values.\n\n•Commercial, financial & agricultural - Risks to this loan category include the inability to monitor the condition of the collateral, which often consists of inventory, accounts receivable and other non-real estate assets. Equipment and inventory obsolescence can also pose a risk. Declines in general economic conditions and other events can cause cash flows to fall to levels insufficient to service debt.\n\n•Consumer and other - Risks common to consumer direct loans include unemployment and changes in local economic conditions as well as the inability to monitor collateral consisting of personal property.\n\nWhen management determines that foreclosure is probable or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\n\nFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.\n\nManagement estimates expected credit losses on commitments to extend credit over the contractual period during which the Company is exposed to credit risk on the underlying commitments. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The ACL is calculated using the same aggregate reserve rates calculated for the funded portion of loans at the portfolio level applied to the amount of commitments expected to fund.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Held-to-Maturity Securities (\"HTM\")\n\nManagement measures current expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. The estimate of current expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Management classifies the HTM portfolio into the following major security types: U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, State, county & municipal securities, and Mortgage-backed securities. Accrued interest receivable on HTM debt is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nAll of the residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities held by the Company as HTM are issued by U.S. Government agencies and government sponsored entities. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The state and political subdivision securities are also highly rated by major rating agencies.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Available-for-Sale Securities (\"AFS\")\n\nFor AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash \n\n73\n\nflows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any amount of unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income. Accrued interest receivable on AFS debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nChanges in the ACL are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the ACL when management believes the uncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\n\nPremises and Equipment\n\nLand is carried at cost. Other premises and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. In general, estimated lives for buildings are up to 40 years, furniture and equipment useful lives range from five to 10 years and the lives of software and computer related equipment range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the related lease, or the related assets, whichever is shorter. Expenditures for major improvements of the Company’s premises and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Minor repairs, maintenance and improvements are charged to operations as incurred. When assets are sold or disposed of, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company has entered into various operating leases for certain branch locations, ATM locations, loan production offices, and corporate support services locations. Generally, these leases have initial lease terms of 6 years or less. Many of the leases have one or more lease renewal options. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion and is considered on a case-by-case basis. Certain of our lease agreements contain early termination options. If renewal options or early termination options are determined by management to be reasonably certain, then they are included in the calculation of the operating right-of-use assets or operating lease liabilities. Certain of our lease agreements provide for periodic adjustments to rental payments for inflation. At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid, discounted using the discount rate for the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. As the majority of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the term of the lease. At the commencement date, the company also recognizes a right-of-use asset measured at (i) the initial measurement of the lease liability; (ii) any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and (iii) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. For these short-term leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At December 31, 2023, the Company had no leases classified as finance leases.\n\nGoodwilland Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value.\n\nIntangible assets consist of core deposit and customer relationship intangibles acquired in connection with a business combination. The core deposit intangible is initially recognized based on an independent valuation performed as of the acquisition date. The core deposit intangible is amortized by the straight-line method over the average remaining life of the acquired customer deposits. The customer relationship intangible is associated with the acquisition of several insurance companies during 2021. The customer intangible assets were also initially recognized based on independent valuations performed as of the acquisition date and are being amortized by the straight-line method over 10 years.\n\nCash Value of Bank Owned Life Insurance\n\nThe Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain officers. The life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.\n\n74\n\nOther Real Estate\n\nOther real estate generally represents real estate acquired through foreclosure and is initially recorded at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition less the cost of disposal. Losses from the acquisition of property in full or partial satisfaction of debt are recorded as loan losses. Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values, and valuation allowances are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value less estimated cost of disposal. Routine holding costs and gains or losses upon disposition are included in foreclosed property expense. \n\nDerivatives\n\nThe Company records cash flow hedges at the inception of a derivative contract based on management’s intentions and belief as to the likely effectiveness of the hedge. Cash flow hedges represent a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and is reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not highly effective in hedging the expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately as interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. \n\nNet cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense, based on the item being hedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in noninterest income or noninterest expense. Cash flows from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same manner as the items being hedged.\n\nThe Company formally documents the relationship between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking hedge transactions at the inception of the hedging relationship. This documentation includes linking cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. The Company discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminated, a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, a hedged firm commitment is no longer firm or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended.\n\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as interest expense. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in OCI are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes is based upon income for financial statement purposes, adjusted for nontaxable income and nondeductible expenses. Deferred income taxes have been provided when different accounting methods have been used in determining income for income tax purposes and for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on future tax consequences attributable to differences arising from the financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. The differences relate primarily to depreciable assets (use of different depreciation methods for financial statement and income tax purposes) and allowance for credit losses (use of the allowance method for financial statement purposes and the direct write-off method for tax purposes). In the event of changes in the tax laws, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted in the period of the enactment of those changes, with effects included in the income tax provision. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return. The subsidiary pays its proportional share of federal income taxes to the Company based on its taxable income.\n\nThe Company’s federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Georgia Department of Revenue, generally for three years after filing.\n\nThe Company believes that its income tax filing positions taken or expected to be taken on its tax returns will more likely than not be sustained upon audit by the taxing authorities and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded.\n\n75\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's contracts with customers generally do not contain terms that require significant judgment to determine the amount of revenue to recognize. The Company's' policies for recognizing noninterest income that falls within the scope of ASC Topic 606, and include service charges on deposits, interchange fees, and insurance revenue (included with other noninterest income). \n\nService charges on deposits include both account maintenance fees and overdraft fees and revenue from safe deposit box rental fees and lockbox services and ATM fees. Revenue is recognized for these services either over time, corresponding with deposit accounts' monthly cycle, or at a point in time for transaction-related services and fees. Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to clients' accounts. Safe deposits and lockbox service fees are recognized over time, on a monthly basis, as the Company's' performance obligation for services is satisfied. ATM fees are transaction-based fees recognized at the time the transaction is executed as that is the point at which the Company satisfies the performance obligation.\n\nInterchange fees include debit card interchange fees. Debit card interchange fees are earned from debit card holder transactions conducted through various payment networks. Interchange fees from debit card holders transactions represent a percentage of the underlying transaction amount and are recognized daily, concurrently with the transaction processing services provided to the debit cardholder.\n\nOther income includes insurance revenue (included in other noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income): Insurance revenue primarily consists of commissions received on insurance products sold. The commissions are recognized as revenue when the client executes an insurance policy with the insurance carrier. In some cases, the company receives payment of trailing commissions each year when the client pays its annual premium. \n\nEarnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the sum of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the effect of the issuance of potential common shares that are dilutive. Potential common shares consist of restricted shares for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and are determined using the treasury stock method. The Company has determined that its outstanding non-vested stock awards are participating securities, and all dividends on these awards are paid similar to other dividends. \n\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nAccounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, represent equity changes from economic events of the period other than transactions with owners. Such items are considered components of other comprehensive income (loss). Accounting standards codification requires the presentation in the consolidated financial statements of net income and all items of other comprehensive income as total comprehensive income (loss).\n\nFair Value Measures\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 16. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates.\n\nOperating Segments\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments, the Banking Division, the Retail Mortgage Division and the Small Business Specialty Lending Division. The Banking Division derives its revenues from the delivery of full service financial services to include commercial loans, consumer loans and deposit accounts. The Retail Mortgage Division derives its revenues from the origination, sales and servicing of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. The Small Business Specialty Lending Division derives its revenues from origination, sales and servicing of SBA and USDA government guaranteed loans.\n\n76\n\nThe Banking, Retail Mortgage and Small Business Specialty Lending Divisions are managed as separate business units because of the different products and services they provide. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on profit or loss from operations. There are no material intersegment sales or transfers.\n\nReclassifications\n\nCertain amounts, previously reported, have been reclassified to state all periods on a comparable basis and had no effect on stockholders’ equity or net income.\n\nAccounting Standards Updates \n\nASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, as amended, was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2023, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Topic 842 on leases. In addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available-for-sale debt securities. One such change is to require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available-for-sale debt securities when management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will not be required to sell.\n\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized cost, and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The Company recorded a net decrease to retained earnings of $1.2 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2023 for the cumulative effect of adopting ASC 326, primarily related to credit losses for unfunded commitments. \n\nASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2023. This ASU provides guidance on eliminating the requirement for classification of and disclosures around troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). The purpose of this guidance is to eliminate unnecessary and overly-complex disclosures of loans that are already incorporated into the allowance for credit losses and related disclosures while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Modified terms include one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the term or amortization period, a more than insignificant payment delay or principal forgiveness. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had two loans that met the requirements of this disclosure and are included in Note 3 - Loans. This ASU further requires the disclosure of current-period gross charge-offs by year of origination. Current period gross charge-offs are included in the term loan vintage table in Note 3 - Loans.\n\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, “Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.” ASU 2023-02 expands the population of investments for which an investor may elect to apply the proportional amortization method. Under the ASU, an investor in a tax equity investment may elect the proportional amortization method for qualifying investments on a tax credit program-by-program basis. To qualify for the proportional amortization method, an investment must meet the criteria previously applicable to low income housing tax credit investments, as clarified by the ASU. The required date of adoption for ASU 2023-02 is January 1, 2024 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (\"ASU 2020-04\"). This ASU provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. It provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The updated guidance was originally effective for all entities from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company has been diligent in responding to reference rate reform and does not anticipate a significant impact to its financial statements as a result. \n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07\"). This ASU was issued to improve segment reporting disclosures. The amendments in this ASU improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information including significant segment expenses \n\n77\n\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker as well as the amount and composition of other segment items on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. Retrospective application is required in all prior periods unless impracticable to do so. The Company will adopt the new disclosure requirements for the annual period beginning on January 1, 2024 and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the incremental segment information that will be required to be disclosed as well as the impact to the Segment Reporting footnote.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-09\"). This ASU was issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The ASU addresses investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Retrospective application in all prior periods is permitted. The Company will adopt the new disclosures for the annual periods beginning on January 1, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the incremental income taxes information that will be required to be disclosed as well as the impact to the Income Taxes footnote. \n\n78\n\nNOTE 2.

As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, accrued interest receivable for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled $2.4 million and $2.6 million, and $1.9 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and is included in the \"other assets\" line item on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n\n79\n\nThe Company transferred certain agency-issued securities from the available-for-sale to held-to-maturity portfolio on January 1, 2022 and September 1, 2022, having a combined book value of approximately $511.0 million and a combined market value of approximately $477.0 million. As of the date of each transfer, the related pre-tax net unrecognized losses of approximately $34.0 million included in other comprehensive loss and remained in other comprehensive loss, to be amortized out of other comprehensive loss over the remaining term of the securities using the effective interest method. This transfer was completed after careful consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Factors used in assessing the ability to hold these securities to maturity were future liquidity needs and sources of funding. The Company has had no other transfers of securities since September 1, 2022.\n\nInformation pertaining to available-for-sale securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 aggregated by investment category and length of time that securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position are summarized as follows:\n\nLess Than 12 Months| 12 Months or More| Total  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| EstimatedFairValue| UnrealizedLosses| EstimatedFairValue| UnrealizedLosses| EstimatedFairValue| UnrealizedLosses  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nU.S. treasury securities| $| — | $| — | $| 498 | $| (2)| $| 498 | $| (2)  \nU.S. agency securities| — | — | 4,139 | (361)| 4,139 | (361)  \nAsset backed securities| 6,196 | (75)| 17,424 | (330)| 23,620 | (405)  \nState, county and municipal securities| 1,033 | (138)| 107,443 | (15,356)| 108,476 | (15,494)  \nCorporate debt securities| 1,446 | (105)| 45,044 | (6,355)| 46,490 | (6,460)  \nMortgage-backed securities| 5,921 | (49)| 212,876 | (25,199)| 218,797 | (25,248)  \nTotal debt securities| $| 14,596 | $| (367)| $| 387,424 | $| (47,603)| $| 402,020 | $| (47,970)  \nDecember 31, 2022  \nU.S. treasury securities| $| 1,377 | $| (17)| $| 245 | $| (5)| $| 1,622 | $| (22)  \nU.S. agency securities| 3,221 | (257)| 1,364 | (193)| 4,585 | (450)  \nAsset backed securities| 10,780 | (319)| 19,208 | (1,161)| 29,988 | $| (1,480)  \nState, county and municipal securities| 29,284 | (3,629)| 75,472 | (17,734)| 104,756 | $| (21,363)  \nCorporate debt securities| 17,258 | (1,463)| 30,651 | (3,857)| 47,909 | (5,320)  \nMortgage-backed securities| 122,031 | (7,890)| 119,409 | (21,301)| 241,440 | (29,191)  \nTotal debt securities| $| 183,951 | $| (13,575)| $| 246,349 | $| (44,251)| $| 430,300 | $| (57,826)  \n  \n80\n\nInformation pertaining to held-to-maturity securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position is summarized as follows:\n\nLess Than 12 Months| 12 Months or Greater| Total  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| FairValue| GrossUnrealizedLosses| FairValue| GrossUnrealizedLosses| FairValue| GrossUnrealizedLosses  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nU.S. treasury securities| $| — | $| — | $| 90,094 | $| (3,212)| $| 90,094 | $| (3,212)  \nU.S. agency securities| — | — | 14,858 | (1,424)| 14,858 | (1,424)  \nState, county & municipal securities| 1,461 | (78)| 103,500 | (13,781)| 104,961 | (13,859)  \nMortgage-backed securities| — | — | 177,442 | (25,316)| 177,442 | (25,316)  \n$| 1,461 | $| (78)| $| 385,894 | $| (43,733)| $| 387,355 | $| (43,811)  \nDecember 31, 2022  \nU.S. treasury securities| $| — | $| — | $| 87,466 | $| (4,149)| $| 87,466 | $| (4,149)  \nU.S. agency securities| — | — | 14,571 | (1,838)| 14,571 | (1,838)  \nState, county & municipal securities| 9,858 | (1,392)| 105,734 | (18,126)| 115,592 | (19,518)  \nMortgage-backed securities| 13,580 | (729)| 178,995 | (28,392)| 192,575 | (29,121)  \n$| 23,438 | $| (2,121)| $| 386,766 | $| (52,505)| $| 410,204 | $| (54,626)  \n  \nManagement evaluates available for sale securities in an unrealized loss position at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation to determine if credit-related impairment exists. Management first evaluates whether they intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell an impaired security before recovering its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the entire amount of unrealized loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security's amortized cost basis. If either of the above criteria is not met, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value is attributable to credit or resulted from other factors. The Company does not intend to sell these investment securities at an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2023, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity. Based on management's review, the Company's available for sale securities have no expected credit losses and no related allowance for credit losses has been established.\n\nThe Company uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for debt securities held to maturity considering the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the portfolio. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the held to maturity portfolio. The Company monitors the held to maturity portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation account would need to be recorded. Based on management's review, the Company's held to maturity securities have no expected credit losses and no related allowance for credit losses has been established.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 273 available-for-sale securities and 146 held-to-maturity securities that have unrealized losses from the Company’s amortized cost basis. These securities are guaranteed by either the U.S. Government, other governments or U.S. corporations. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition. The unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. As management has the ability to hold debt securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future if classified as available-for-sale, no declines are due to reasons of credit quality. \n\nThe amortized cost and fair value of investment securities as of December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity, are shown hereafter. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities for certain investments because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. This is often the case with mortgage-backed securities, which are disclosed separately in the table below.\n\n81\n\nAvailable for Sale| Held to Maturity  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Amortized Cost| Fair Value| Amortized Cost| Fair Value  \nDue in one year or less| $| 715 | $| 713 | $| 3,937 | $| 3,882   \nDue after one year through five years| 15,714 | 14,697 | 94,194 | 90,873   \nDue after five years through ten years| 102,474 | 88,639 | 76,529 | 68,260   \nDue after ten years| 89,490 | 81,644 | 71,613 | 65,119   \n$| 208,393 | $| 185,693 | $| 246,273 | $| 228,134   \nMortgage-backed securities| 246,901 | 221,689 | 202,758 | 177,442   \n$| 455,294 | $| 407,382 | $| 449,031 | $| 405,576   \n  \nThe Company had no sales of investment securities in 2023. For the year ended 2022, proceeds from sales of investments available for sale were $60.9 million. Gross realized gains totaled $24,000 and gross realized losses totaled $106,000 in 2022.\n\nInvestment securities having a carrying value totaling $429.9 million and $541.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and for other purposes.\n\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended on January 1, 2023 which included evaluation of expected credit losses on debt securities. As part of the Company's calculated credit losses, the allowance for credit losses on investment securities was determined to be de minimis due to the high credit quality of the portfolio, which includes securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agencies and high quality municipalities. Therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded as of December 31, 2023. See Note 1 for additional details on the allowance for credit losses as it relates to the securities portfolio.\n\n82\n\nNOTE 3.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, accrued interest receivable for loans totaled $8.8 million and $6.8 million and is included in the \"other assets\" line item on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\n\nCommercial, financial and agricultural loans are extended to a diverse group of businesses within the Company’s market area. These loans are often underwritten based on the borrower’s ability to service the debt from income from the business. Real estate construction loans often require loan funds to be advanced prior to completion of the project. Due to uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, changes in interest rates and other economic conditions, these loans often pose a higher risk than other types of loans. Consumer loans are originated at the bank level. These loans are generally smaller loan amounts spread across many individual borrowers to help minimize risk.\n\nCredit Quality Indicators. As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to (1) the risk grade assigned to commercial and consumer loans, (2) the level of classified commercial loans, (3) net charge-offs, (4) nonperforming loans, and (5) the general economic conditions in the Company’s geographic markets.\n\nThe Company uses a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each of its loans. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 10. A description of the general characteristics of the grades is as follows:\n\n•Grades 1, 2 and 3 - Borrowers with these assigned risk grades range from virtual absence of risk to minimal risk. Such loans may be secured by Company-issued and controlled certificates of deposit or properly margined equity securities or bonds. Other loans comprising these grades are made to companies that have been in existence for a long period of time with many years of consecutive profits and strong equity, good liquidity, excellent debt service ability and unblemished past performance, or to exceptionally strong individuals with collateral of unquestioned value that fully secures the loans. Loans in this category fall into the “pass” classification.\n\n•Grades 4 and 5 - Loans assigned these “pass” risk grades are made to borrowers with acceptable credit quality and risk. The risk ranges from loans with no significant weaknesses in repayment capacity and collateral protection to \n\n83\n\nacceptable loans with one or more risk factors considered to be more than average. These loans are also included in the “pass” classification.\n\n•Grade 6 - This grade includes “special mention” loans on management’s watch list and is intended to be used on a temporary basis for pass grade loans where risk-modifying action is intended in the short-term.\n\n•Grades 7 and 8 - These grades includes “substandard” loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines. This category includes borrowers with well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the payment of the debt in accordance with the agreed terms. Loans considered to be impaired are assigned grade 8, and these loans often have assigned loss allocations as part of the allowance for credit losses. Generally, loans on which interest accrual has been stopped would be included in this grade.\n\n•Grades 9 and 10 - These grades correspond to regulatory classification definitions of “doubtful” and “loss,” respectively. In practice, any loan with these grades would be for a very short period of time, and generally the Company has no loans with these assigned grades. Management manages the Company’s problem loans in such a way that uncollectible loans or uncollectible portions of loans are charged off immediately with any residual, collectible amounts assigned a risk grade of 7 or 8. \n\nThe following table presents the loan portfolio segregated by class of loans and the risk category of term loans by vintage year, which is the year of origination or most recent renewal, as of December 31, 2023. Those loans with a risk grade of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 have been combined in the pass column for presentation purposes. There were no loans with a risk rating of \"doubtful\" or \"loss\" at December 31, 2023.\n\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022| 2021| 2020| 2019| Prior| Revolvers| Revolvers converted to term loans| Total  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nConstruction, land & land development  \nRisk rating  \nPass| $| 112,587 | $| 91,981 | $| 27,332 | $| 5,654 | $| 1,000 | $| 5,765 | $| 605 | $| 31 | $| 244,955   \nSpecial Mention| 792 | — | 25 | — | — | 29 | 282 | — | 1,128   \nSubstandard| — | 888 | 4 | — | 20 | 151 | — | — | 1,063   \nTotal Construction, land & land development| 113,379 | 92,869 | 27,361 | 5,654 | 1,020 | 5,945 | 887 | 31 | 247,146   \nCurrent period gross write offs| $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| —   \nOther commercial real estate  \nRisk rating  \nPass| 61,816 | 341,656 | 204,145 | 88,629 | 79,123 | 145,374 | 24,158 | 2,031 | 946,932   \nSpecial Mention| 75 | 3,251 | 766 | 2,113 | 5,733 | 4,694 | 545 | 48 | 17,225   \nSubstandard| 2,303 | 2,615 | 211 | — | 486 | 4,395 | 208 | — | 10,218   \nTotal Other commercial real estate| 64,194 | 347,522 | 205,122 | 90,742 | 85,342 | 154,463 | 24,911 | 2,079 | 974,375   \nCurrent period gross write offs| — | — | 69 | — | — | — | — | — | 69   \nResidential real estate  \nRisk rating  \nPass| 78,088 | 116,704 | 50,986 | 21,892 | 8,510 | 43,038 | 22,642 | 100 | 341,960   \nSpecial Mention| 856 | 466 | 10 | 50 | 679 | 4,687 | 424 | — | 7,172   \nSubstandard| — | 1,169 | 384 | 296 | 272 | 4,735 | 246 | — | 7,102   \nTotal Residential real estate| 78,944 | 118,339 | 51,380 | 22,238 | 9,461 | 52,460 | 23,312 | 100 | 356,234   \nCurrent period gross write offs| 253 | 492 | 26 | — | — | — | — | — | 771   \n  \n84\n\nCommercial, financial & agricultural  \n---  \nRisk rating  \nPass| 66,820 | 51,439 | 21,673 | 12,489 | 4,734 | 14,002 | 58,607 | 306 | 230,070   \nSpecial Mention| 4,186 | 894 | 376 | 745 | 188 | 40 | 974 | — | 7,403   \nSubstandard| 164 | 1,872 | 1,979 | 190 | 25 | 165 | 866 | 22 | 5,283   \nTotal Commercial, financial & agricultural| 71,170 | 54,205 | 24,028 | 13,424 | 4,947 | 14,207 | 60,447 | 328 | 242,756   \nCurrent period gross write offs| 150 | 168 | 408 | 200 | 9 | 134 | — | — | 1,069   \nConsumer and other  \nRisk rating  \nPass| 53,117 | 4,021 | 2,004 | 1,240 | 925 | 908 | 462 | 1 | 62,678   \nSpecial Mention| 79 | 42 | 38 | 12 | 25 | 1 | — | — | 197   \nSubstandard| 43 | 20 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 9 | — | — | 84   \nTotal Consumer and other| 53,239 | 4,083 | 2,045 | 1,257 | 954 | 918 | 462 | 1 | 62,959   \nCurrent period gross write offs| 9 | 12 | 10 | 2 | — | 2 | — | — | 35   \nTotal Loans  \nRisk rating  \nPass| 372,428 | 605,801 | 306,140 | 129,904 | 94,292 | 209,087 | 106,474 | 2,469 | 1,826,595   \nSpecial Mention| 5,988 | 4,653 | 1,215 | 2,920 | 6,625 | 9,451 | 2,225 | 48 | 33,125   \nSubstandard| 2,510 | 6,564 | 2,581 | 491 | 807 | 9,455 | 1,320 | 22 | 23,750   \nTotal Loans| $| 380,926 | $| 617,018 | $| 309,936 | $| 133,315 | $| 101,724 | $| 227,993 | $| 110,019 | $| 2,539 | $| 1,883,470   \nTotal current period gross write offs| $| 412 | $| 672 | $| 513 | $| 202 | $| 9 | $| 136 | $| — | $| — | $| 1,944   \n  \nThe following table presents the loan portfolio by credit quality indicator (risk grade) as of December 31, 2022.

Loan risk grades are subject to reassessment at various times throughout the year as part of the Company’s ongoing loan review process. Loans with an assigned risk grade of 7 or worse and an outstanding balance of $500,000 or more are reassessed on a quarterly basis. During this reassessment process individual reserves may be identified and placed against certain loans which are not considered impaired. In assessing the overall economic condition of the markets in which it operates, the Company monitors the unemployment rates for its major service areas. The unemployment rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the allowance for credit loss determination.\n\nLoans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provision. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether such loans are considered past due. \n\n85\n\nLoans are classified as collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral. Our commercial loans have collateral that is comprised of real estate and business assets. Our consumer loans have collateral that is substantially comprised of residential real estate.\n\nThe following table represents an age analysis of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, segregated by class of loans, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nAccruing Loans  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| 30-89 DaysPast Due| 90 Daysor MorePast Due| Total AccruingLoans Past Due| NonaccrualLoans| Current Loans| Total Loans  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 812 | $| — | $| 812 | $| 85 | $| 246,249 | $| 247,146   \nOther commercial real estate| 1,796 | — | 1,796 | 4,219 | 968,360 | 974,375   \nTotal commercial real estate| 2,608 | — | 2,608 | 4,304 | 1,214,609 | 1,221,521   \nResidential real estate| 2,503 | 350 | 2,853 | 3,561 | 349,820 | 356,234   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 775 | — | 775 | 1,956 | 240,025 | 242,756   \nConsumer and other| 183 | 20 | 203 | 18 | 62,738 | 62,959   \nTotal loans| $| 6,069 | $| 370 | $| 6,439 | $| 9,839 | $| 1,867,192 | $| 1,883,470   \n  \nAccruing Loans  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| 30-89 DaysPast Due| 90 Daysor MorePast Due| Total AccruingLoans Past Due| NonaccrualLoans| Current Loans| Total Loans  \nDecember 31, 2022  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| — | $| — | $| — | $| 149 | $| 229,286 | $| 229,435   \nOther commercial real estate| 395 | — | 395 | 1,509 | 973,543 | 975,447   \nTotal commercial real estate| 395 | — | 395 | 1,658 | 1,202,829 | 1,204,882   \nResidential real estate| 882 | — | 882 | 2,686 | 286,486 | 290,054   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 476 | — | 476 | 1,341 | 222,106 | 223,923   \nConsumer and other| 40 | — | 40 | 21 | 18,186 | 18,247   \nTotal loans| $| 1,793 | $| — | $| 1,793 | $| 5,706 | $| 1,729,607 | $| 1,737,106   \n  \nThe following table is a summary of the Company's nonaccrual loans by major categories for the periods indicated.\n\nDecember 31, 2023| December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Nonaccrual Loans with No Related ACL| Nonaccrual Loans with a Related ACL| Total Nonaccrual Loans| NonaccrualLoans  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 27 | $| 58 | $| 85 | $| 149   \nOther commercial real estate| 2,806 | 1,413 | 4,219 | 1,509   \nTotal commercial real estate| 2,833 | 2,833 | 1,471 | 4,304 | 1,658   \nResidential real estate| 725 | 2,836 | 3,561 | 2,686   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| — | 1,956 | 1,956 | 1,341   \nConsumer and other| — | 18 | 18 | 21   \nTotal loans| $| 3,558 | $| 6,281 | $| 9,839 | $| 5,706   \n  \n86\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties that were in the process of foreclosure were $1.0 million and are included in the total nonaccrual loan balance above.

Had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contractual terms, the Company would have recognized additional interest income of approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nInterest income recorded on impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $724,000, and reflects interest income recorded on nonaccrual loans prior to them being placed on nonaccrual status and interest income recorded on TDRs. Had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contractual terms, the Company would have recognized additional interest income of approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification.\n\n87\n\nBecause the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its real estate loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses.\n\nIn some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan, or portion of a loan, has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan, or portion of the loan, is written off.\n\nThe following table presents loans modified due to a financial difficulty under the above terms during the year ended December 31, 2023\n\nLoans modified due to financial difficulty  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Term Extension| Term Extension and Payment Delay| Total*  \nResidential real estate| $| 12 | $| — | $| 12   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| — | 10 | 10   \nTotal Loans| $| 12 | $| 10 | $| 22   \n*less than .01% of total class of receivable  \n.\n\nThere was one loan in each of the above categories. The residential real estate loan had a term extension of two years. The commercial, financial & agricultural loan had a term extension of two years and was given a payment delay.\n\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, the restructuring of a loan was considered a troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR\") if both the borrower was experiencing financial difficulties and the Company had granted a concession to the terms of the loan. Concessions may have included interest rate reductions to below market interest rates, principal forgiveness, restructured amortization schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses.\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, once a loan was identified as a TDR, it was accounted for as an impaired loan. The Company had no unfunded commitments to lend to a customer that had a troubled debt restructured loan as of December 31, 2022. Loans modified in a TDR were considered to be in default once the loan became 90 days past due. A TDR ceased being classified as impaired if the loan was subsequently modified at market terms and, had performed according to the modified terms for at least six months, and there had not been any prior principal forgiveness on a cumulative basis.\n\nThe Company had no loans that subsequently defaulted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. \n\n88\n\nNOTE 4. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\nAs previously mentioned in Note 1, since the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, the ACL for loans represents management's estimate of life of loan credit losses in the portfolio as of the end of the period. The ACL related to unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The following table presents the balance sheet activity in the ACL by portfolio segment for loans, using the CECL methodology for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\nCECL  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Balance, December 31, 2022| Adoption of ASU 2016-13| Charge-offs| Recoveries| Provision for credit losses on loans| Balance, December 31, 2023  \nYear ended December 31, 2023  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 1,959 | $| 148 | $| — | $| 10 | $| 87 | $| 2,204   \nOther commercial real estate| 8,886 | (630)| (69)| 42 | (1,165)| 7,064   \nTotal commercial real estate| 10,845 | (482)| (69)| 52 | (1,078)| 9,268   \nResidential real estate| 2,354 | 1,053 | (771)| 79 | 2,390 | 5,105   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 2,709 | (690)| (1,069)| 201 | 959 | 2,110   \nConsumer and other| 220 | 66 | (35)| 22 | 1,615 | 1,888   \nTotal allowance for credit losses on loans| $| 16,128 | $| (53)| $| (1,944)| $| 354 | $| 3,886 | $| 18,371   \n  \nColony used a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. The changes in loss rates used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses during this period were modeled using historical data from peer banks and macroeconomic forecast data obtained from a third party vendor, which were then applied to Colony's recent default experience as a starting point. As of December 31, 2023, the Company expects that the markets in which it operates will experience stable economic and unemployment conditions with the trend of delinquencies returning to more normalized levels, over the next two years. Management adjusted the historical loss experience for these expectations. No reversion adjustments were necessary, as the starting point for the Company's estimate was a cumulative loss rate covering the expected contractual term of the portfolio.\n\nThe following table details activity in the allowance for loan losses, segregated by class of loans, using the incurred loss methodology for the year ended December 31, 2022. Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other loan categories and periodically may result in reallocation within the provision categories.\n\nIncurred Loss  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Balance, December 31, 2021| Charge-offs| Recoveries| Provision| Balance, December 31, 2022  \nYear ended December 31, 2022  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 1,127 | $| — | $| 25 | $| 807 | $| 1,959   \nOther commercial real estate| 7,691 | (58)| 85 | 1,168 | 8,886   \nTotal commercial real estate| 8,818 | (58)| 110 | 1,975 | 10,845   \nResidential real estate| 1,805 | (48)| 50 | 547 | 2,354   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 1,083 | (314)| 139 | 1,801 | 2,709   \nConsumer and other| 1,204 | (60)| 29 | (953)| 220   \nTotal allowance for loan losses| $| 12,910 | $| (480)| $| 328 | $| 3,370 | $| 16,128   \n  \n89\n\nThe following table represents the recorded investment in loans by portfolio segment and the balance of the allowance assigned to each segment based on the incurred loss methodology of evaluating the loans for impairment as of December 31, 2022.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| Construction,land & landdevelopment| Othercommercialreal estate| Residentialreal estate| Commercial,financial &agricultural| Consumer andother| Total  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nYear ended December 31, 2022  \nPeriod-end amount allocated to:  \nIndividually evaluated for impairment| $| 44 | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| — | $| 44   \nCollectively evaluated for impairment| 1,915 | 8,853 | 2,354 | 2,709 | 220 | 16,051   \nPurchase credit impaired| — | 33 | — | — | — | 33   \nEnding balance| $| 1,959 | $| 8,886 | $| 2,354 | $| 2,709 | $| 220 | $| 16,128   \nLoans:  \nLoans individually evaluated for impairment| $| 514 | $| 3,754 | $| 62 | $| — | $| — | $| 4,330   \nLoans collectively evaluated for impairment| 228,921 | 970,895 | 289,992 | 223,923 | 18,247 | 1,731,978   \nPurchase credit impaired| — | 798 | — | — | — | 798   \nEnding balance| $| 229,435 | $| 975,447 | $| 290,054 | $| 223,923 | $| 18,247 | $| 1,737,106   \n  \nThe Company determines its individual reserves during its quarterly review of substandard loans. This process involves reviewing all loans with a risk grade of 7 or greater and an outstanding balance of $500,000 or more, regardless of the loans impairment classification.\n\nThe Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit, commitments to extend future credit, as well as both standby and commercial letters of credit when there is a contractual obligation to extend credit and when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments is separately classified on the balance sheet within Other liabilities.\n\nThe following table presents the balance and activity in the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| Total Allowance for Credit Losses-Unfunded Commitments  \n---|---  \nYear Ended  \nBalance, December 31, 2022| $| —   \nAdjustment to allowance for unfunded commitments for adoption of ASU 2016-13| 1,661   \nChange in unfunded commitments| (286)  \nBalance, December 31, 2023| $| 1,375  \n  \n90\n\nNOTE5.PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT\n\nPremises and equipment are comprised of the following as of December 31:\n\n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022  \n---|---|---  \nLand| $| 11,559 | $| 12,944   \nBuilding| 38,567 | 37,718   \nFurniture, fixtures and equipment| 20,670 | 19,524   \nLeasehold improvements| 1,384 | 1,099   \nConstruction in progress | 182 | 942   \nTotal cost| 72,362 | 72,227   \nAccumulated depreciation| (32,492)| (30,621)  \nTotal premises and equipment| $| 39,870 | $| 41,606   \n  \nDepreciation charged to operations totaled $2.4 million in 2023 and $2.7 million in 2022.

DERIVATIVES\n\nAs part of its asset liability management activities, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps to help manage its interest rate risk position and mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. The Company entered into two interest rate swaps during the second quarter of 2023, to hedge the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark SOFR interest rate risk for its short-term funding over the term of these cash flow hedges. \n\nThe notional amount of an interest rate swap does not represent the amount exchanged by the parties. The exchange of cash flows is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the interest rate swap agreements.\n\nOn June 23, 2023, the Company entered into a five-year interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $25.0 million. On June 26, 2023 the Company entered into a three-year interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $25.0 million. Both of the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of certain variable rate liabilities.\n\nThe derivatives are recorded in other liabilities on the Company's balance sheet and has a value of $438,000 as of December 31, 2023.\n\nGains were recorded on the swap transactions, which totaled $349,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Amounts reported in accumulated OCI related to swaps are reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Bank's variable rate liabilities.\n\nThe following table presents the amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of income and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income relating to the interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| Year ended December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAmount of loss recognized in OCI| $| 326   \nAmount of gain reclassified from OCI to interest expense| $| 349   \n  \n95\n\nNOTE11.

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the lendable collateral value of those loans and securities pledged was $235.2 million and $150.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the Company had remaining credit availability from the FHLB of $596.2 million. At December 31, 2022, the Company had remaining credit availability from the FHLB of $574.9 million. The Company may be required to pledge additional qualifying collateral in order to utilize the full amount of the remaining credit line.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company also has available federal funds lines of credit with various financial institutions totaling $64.5 million, of which there were none outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe Company has the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of Atlanta utilizing the discount window. The discount window is an instrument of monetary policy that allows eligible institutions to borrow money from the FRB on a short-term basis to meet temporary liquidity shortages caused by internal or external disruptions. The Company had borrowing capacity available under this arrangement, with none outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company could be required to pledge certain available-for-sale investment securities as collateral under this agreement.\n\nThe Company also has the ability to participate in the FRB Term Funding Program, a new form of one-year emergency funding, with an available line of $100.0 million. The Company would be required to purchase Treasury securities or other debt obligations. The Company has not utilized this source of funding as of December 31, 2023.\n\nOn May 20, 2022, the Company completed a private placement of $40.0 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). The Notes will bear a fixed rate of 5.25% for the first five years and will reset quarterly thereafter to then current three-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 265 basis points for the five year floating term. The Company is entitled to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after May 20, 2027, or at any time, in whole but not in part, upon certain other specified events. At December 31, 2023, $39.2 million of the Notes, net of debt issuance costs were outstanding. The notes are recorded as other borrowings on the consolidated balance sheets and, subject to certain limitations, qualify as Tier 2 Capital for regulatory capital purposes.\n\nSubordinated Debentures (Trust Preferred Securities)\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2004, the Company formed Colony Bankcorp Statutory Trust III for the sole purpose of issuing $4,500,000 in Trust Preferred Securities through a pool sponsored by FTN Financial Capital Market. The securities have a maturity of thirty years and are redeemable after five years with certain exceptions.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2006, the Company formed Colony Bankcorp Capital Trust I for the sole purpose of issuing $5,000,000 in Trust Preferred Securities through a pool sponsored by Truist Capital Markets. The securities have a maturity of thirty years and are redeemable after five years with certain exceptions.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2007, the Company formed Colony Bankcorp Capital Trust II for the sole purpose of issuing $9,000,000 in Trust Preferred Securities through a pool sponsored by Trapeza Capital Management, LLC. The securities have a maturity of thirty years and are redeemable after five years with certain exceptions. Proceeds from this issuance were used to pay off trust preferred securities issued on March 26, 2002 through Colony Bankcorp Statutory Trust I.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2007, the Company formed Colony Bankcorp Capital Trust III for the sole purpose of issuing $5,000,000 in Trust Preferred Securities through a pool sponsored by Trapeza Capital Management, LLC. The securities have a maturity of thirty years and are redeemable after five years with certain exceptions. Proceeds from this issuance were used to pay off trust preferred securities issued on December 19, 2002 through Colony Bankcorp Statutory Trust II.\n\nThe Company is not in default of any outstanding Trust Preferred Securities as of December 31, 2023.\n\n97\n\nThe following table presents the information regarding the Company's subordinated debentures at December 31, 2023 and 2022. All subordinated debentures are at benchmark rates based on SOFR at December 31, 2023.\n\nDescription| Date| Amount| AddedPoints | Maturity| 5-YearCall Option  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)  \nColony Bankcorp Statutory Trust III| June 16, 2004| $| 4,640 | 2.68%| June 17, 2034| June 17, 2009  \nColony Bankcorp Capital Trust I| April 13, 2006| 5,155 | 1.50%| June 30, 2036| April 13, 2011  \nColony Bankcorp Capital Trust II| March 12, 2007| 9,279 | 1.65%| March 30, 2037| March 12, 2012  \nColony Bankcorp Capital Trust III| September 14, 2007| 5,155 | 1.40%| October 30, 2037| September 14, 2012  \n  \nThe Trust Preferred Securities are recorded as subordinated debentures on the consolidated balance sheets and, subject to certain limitations, qualify as Tier 1 Capital for regulatory capital purposes. The proceeds from these offerings were used to fund certain acquisitions, pay off holding company debt and inject capital into the Bank subsidiary. The Trust Preferred Securities pay interest quarterly.\n\n98\n\nNOTE12. LEASES\n\nA lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-2 and all subsequent ASUs that modified this topic (collectively referred to as “Topic 842”). For the Company, Topic 842 primarily affected the accounting treatment for operating lease agreements in which the Company is the lessee.\n\nSubstantially all of the leases in which the Company is the lessee are comprised of real estate for branches and office space with terms extending through 2028. All of our leases are classified as operating leases, and therefore, were previously not recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. With the adoption of Topic 842, operating lease arrangements are required to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability.\n\nThe following table represents the consolidated balance sheet classification of the Company’s ROU assets and liabilities. The Company elected not to include short-term leases (i.e., leases with initial terms of twelve months or less), or equipment leases (deemed immaterial) on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n(dollars in thousands)| Classification| December 31, 2023| December 31, 2022  \n---|---|---|---  \nAssets  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| Other assets| $| 1,579 | $| 1,834   \nLiabilities  \nOperating lease liabilities| Other liabilities | $| 1,829 | $| 1,895   \n  \nThe calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments and lease incentive payments. The Company’s lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Company’s discretion. If at lease inception the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Regarding the discount rate, Topic 842 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term. For operating leases existing prior to January 1, 2019, the rate for the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019 was used.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, operating lease cost was $626,000 and $615,000, respectively.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term was 3.89 years and the weighted average discount rate was 4.31%.\n\nThe following table represents the future maturities of the Company’s operating lease liabilities and other lease information.\n\n(dollars in thousands)  \n---  \nYear| Lease Liability  \n2024| $| 642   \n2025| 596   \n2026| 360   \n2027| 297   \n2028| 72   \nTotal Lease Payments| $| 1,967   \nLess: Interest| (138)  \nPresent Value of Lease Liabilities| $| 1,829   \n  \nSupplemental Lease Information: (dollars in thousands)| December 31, 2023| December 31, 2022  \n---|---|---  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:  \nOperating cash flows from operating leases (cash payments)| $| 645 | $| 549   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for leases entered into during the period| 500 | 1,750   \n  \n99\n\nNOTE13.COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nThe Company offers a defined contribution 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the \"Plan\") which covers substantially all employees who meet certain age and service requirements. The Plan allows employees to make voluntary pre-tax salary deferrals to the Plan. The Company, at its discretion, may elect to make an annual contribution to the Plan equal to a percentage of each participating employee’s salary. Such discretionary contributions must be approved by the Company’s board of directors. Employees are fully vested in the Company contributions after six years of service. In 2023 and 2022, the Company made total contributions of $1.9 million and $1.9 million to the Plan, respectively.\n\nColony Bank, the wholly-owned subsidiary, has deferred compensation plans covering certain former directors and certain officers choosing to participate through individual deferred compensation contracts. In accordance with terms of the contracts, the Bank is committed to pay the participant’s deferred compensation over a specified number of years, beginning at age 65. In the event of a participant’s death before age 65, payments are made to the participant’s named beneficiary over a specified number of years, beginning on the first day of the month following the death of the participant.\n\nLiabilities accrued under the plans totaled $1.1 million and $1.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Benefits accrued monthly under the contracts totaled $32,000 in 2023 and $39,000 in 2022. Payments were $140,000 in 2023 and $151,000 in 2022. \n\nThe Company has purchased life insurance policies on the plans’ participants and uses the cash flow from these policies to partially fund the plan. There was no fee income recognized in 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe Company awards restricted shares of the Company's common stock to various bank employees with a grant price equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. The restricted shares vest in equal installments over three years, subject to continued service through each applicable vesting date, or earlier upon the occurrence of a change in control. With the restricted stock, there will be no cash consideration to the Company for the shares. The employees will have the right to vote all shares subject to such grant and receive all dividends with respect to such shares, whether or not the shares have vested.\n\nThe following table presents the outstanding balance for restricted stock awards as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. \n\nQuantity| Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value  \n---|---  \nOutstanding at December 31, 2021| 187,300 | $| 17.93   \nGranted| 139,720 | 16.11   \nVested| (71,154)| 17.93   \nForfeited| (9,000)| 17.36   \nOutstanding at December 31, 2022| 246,866 | 16.92   \nGranted| 55,210 | 9.67   \nVested| (103,224)| 17.12   \nForfeited| (22,859)| 16.29   \nOutstanding at December 31, 2023| 175,993 | 14.67   \n  \nCompensation expense for restricted stock is based on the market price of the Company stock at the time of the grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Total compensation expense unrecognized for the restricted shares granted for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.\n\nNOTE14.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nCredit-Related Financial Instruments. The Company is a party to credit-related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments \n\n100\n\nto extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk:\n\nContract Amount  \n---  \n2023| 2022  \n(dollars in thousands)  \nCommitments to extend credit| $| 362,878 | $| 379,997   \nStandby letters of credit| 5,656 | 3,333   \n  \nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer.\n\nUnfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed.\n\nStandby and performance letters of credit are conditional lending commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Essentially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.\n\nLegal Contingencies. In the ordinary course of business, there are various legal proceedings pending against Colony and its subsidiaries. The aggregate liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on Colony’s consolidated financial position.\n\nNOTE 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe following table reflects the activity and aggregate balance of direct and indirect loans to directors, executive officers or principal holders of equity securities of the Company. All such loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and do not involve more than a normal risk of collectability. A summary of activity of related party loans is shown below:\n\n(dollars in thousands)| 2023| 2022  \n---|---|---  \nBalance, Beginning| $| 3,443 | $| 7,732   \nNew loans| 4,095 | 1,182   \nRepayments| (1,146)| (5,471)  \nTransactions due to changes in directors| (285)| —   \nBalance, Ending| $| 6,107 | $| 3,443   \n  \n101\n\nNOTE16.FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nGenerally accepted accounting standards in the U.S. require disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the face of the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of Colony Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiaries financial instruments are detailed hereafter. Where quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. The use of discounted cash flows can be significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles related to Fair Value Measurements define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\n\n• Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\n• Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial\n\ninstrument.\n\n• Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and represent the Company’s own assumptions about the\n\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\n\nThe following disclosures should not be considered a surrogate of the liquidation value of the Company, but rather a good-faith estimate of the increase or decrease in value of financial instruments held by the Company since purchase, origination or issuance.\n\n102\n\nCash and short-term investments - For cash, due from banks, bank-owned deposits and federal funds sold, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value and is classified Level 1.\n\nInvestment securities - Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices where available and classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments and classified as Level 2. If a comparable is not available, the investment securities are classified as Level 3.\n\nOther investments, at cost - The fair value of other bank stock approximates carrying value and is classified as Level 2. Fair values for investment funds are based on quoted market prices where available and classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments and classified as Level 2. If a comparable is not available, the investment securities are classified as Level 3.\n\nLoans held for sale – The fair value of loans held for sale is determined on outstanding commitments from third party investors in the secondary markets and is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\n\nLoans, net - The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. For variable rate loans, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Loans are classified as Level 3.\n\nDerivative instruments - The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments. The variable cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2.\n\nDeposit liabilities - The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date and is classified as Level 1. The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities and is classified as Level 2.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances – The fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank advances is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar advances would be obtained. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are classified as Level 2.\n\nOther borrowings – The fair value of other borrowings is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows using an estimated interest rate based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar remaining maturities and collateral terms. Other borrowings is classified as Level 2 due to their expected maturities.\n\n103\n\nDisclosures of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis, are required in the financial statements.\n\nThe carrying amount, estimated fair values, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows: \n\nCarrying| Estimated| Level  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Amount| Fair Value| 1| 2| 3  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nAssets  \nCash and short-term investments| $| 83,322 | $| 83,322 | $| 83,322 | $| — | $| —   \nInvestment securities available for sale| 407,382 | 407,382 | — | 396,568 | 10,814   \nInvestment securities held to maturity| 449,031 | 405,576 | — | 405,576 | —   \nOther investments| 16,868 | 16,868 | — | 16,868 | —   \nLoans held for sale| 27,958 | 27,958 | — | 27,958 | —   \nLoans, net| 1,865,099 | 1,699,870 | — | — | 1,699,870   \nLiabilities  \nDeposits| 2,544,790 | 2,538,477 | — | 2,538,477 | —   \nFederal Home Loan Bank advances| 175,000 | 176,022 | — | 176,022 | —   \nOther borrowed money| 63,445 | 51,056 | — | 51,056 | —   \nDerivative instruments| 438 | 438 | — | 438 | —   \nDecember 31, 2022  \nAssets  \nCash and short-term investments| $| 80,678 | $| 80,678 | $| 80,678 | $| — | $| —   \nInvestment securities available for sale| 432,553 | 432,553 | — | 416,957 | 15,596   \nInvestment securities held to maturity| 465,858 | 411,264 | 411,264 | —   \nOther investments, at cost| 13,793 | 13,793 | — | 13,003 | 790   \nLoans held for sale| 17,743 | 17,743 | — | 17,743 | —   \nLoans, net| 1,720,978 | 1,469,707 | — | — | 1,469,707   \nLiabilities  \nDeposits| 2,490,997 | 2,489,481 | — | 2,489,481 | —   \nFederal Home Loan Bank advances| 125,000 | 125,163 | — | 125,163 | —   \nOther borrowed money| 78,352 | 69,930 | — | 69,930 | —   \n  \nFair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on many judgments. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.\n\nFair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments include deferred income taxes and premises and equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.\n\n104\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy:\n\nSecurities – Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 inputs include securities that have quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flow. Examples of such instruments, which would generally be classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include certain collateralized mortgage and debt obligations and certain high-yield debt securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. When measuring fair value, the valuation techniques available under the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used. The Company’s evaluations are based on market data and the Company employs combinations of these approaches for its valuation methods depending on the asset class.\n\nCollateral Dependent Impaired Loans - Impaired loans are those loans which the Company has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan’s collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third-party appraisals of the properties, or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. These assets are included as level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.\n\nOther Real Estate Owned - Other real estate owned assets are adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs upon transfer of the loans to other real estate owned. Typically, an external, third-party appraisal is performed on the collateral upon transfer into the other real estate owned account to determine the asset’s fair value. Subsequent adjustments to the collateral’s value may be based upon either updated third-party appraisals or management’s knowledge of the collateral and the current real estate market conditions. Appraised amounts used in determining the asset’s fair value, whether internally or externally prepared, are discounted 10 percent to account for selling and marketing costs. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Because of the high degree of judgment required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned assets and because of the relationship between fair value and general economic conditions, we consider the fair value of other real estate owned assets to be highly sensitive to changes in market conditions.\n\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring and Nonrecurring Basis - The following table presents the recorded amount of the Company’s assets measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall. The table below includes collateral dependent loans and other real estate properties at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Those collateral dependent loans and other real estate properties are shown net of the related specific reserves and valuation allowances.\n\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Total FairValue| Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1)| SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2)| SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)  \nDecember 31, 2023  \nNonrecurring  \nCollateral dependent loans| $| 1,410 | $| — | $| — | $| 1,410   \nOther real estate| 448 | — | — | 448   \nDecember 31, 2022  \nNonrecurring  \nCollateral dependent loans| $| 521 | $| — | $| — | $| 521   \nOther real estate| 651 | — | — | 651   \n  \n105\n\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\n\nThe following tables present quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements for assets in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy measured on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Upon approval by regulatory authorities, the Bank may pay cash dividends to the parent company in excess of regulatory limitations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and, possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\n\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets, and of Tier I capital to average assets. As of December 31, 2023, the interim final Basel III rules (Basel III) require the Company to also maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets. These amounts and ratios as defined in regulations are presented hereafter. Management believes, as of December 31, 2023, the Company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. In the opinion of management, there are no conditions or events since prior notification of capital adequacy from the regulators that have changed the institution’s category.\n\nThe Basel III rules also require the Company to maintain a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.\n\n108\n\nThe following table summarizes regulatory capital information as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 on a consolidated basis and for the subsidiary, as defined. Regulatory capital ratios for December 31, 2023 and 2022 were calculated in accordance with the Basel III rules. \n\nActual| For CapitalAdequacy Purposes| To Be WellCapitalized UnderPrompt CorrectiveAction Provisions  \n---|---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Amount| Ratio| Amount| Ratio| Amount| Ratio  \nAs of December 31, 2023  \nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets  \nConsolidated| $| 337,159 | 15.47 | %| $| 174,355 | 8.00 | %| $| 217,944 | 10.00 | %  \nColony Bank| 300,497 | 13.85 | 173,572 | 8.00 | 216,965 | 10.00   \nTier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets  \nConsolidated| 278,196 | 12.77 | 130,711 | 6.00 | 174,281 | 8.00   \nColony Bank| 280,751 | 12.94 | 130,178 | 6.00 | 173,571 | 8.00   \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets  \nConsolidated| 253,967 | 11.66 | 98,015 | 4.50 | 141,577 | 6.50   \nColony Bank| 280,751 | 12.94 | 97,634 | 4.50 | 141,026 | 6.50   \nTier I Capital to Average Assets  \nConsolidated| 278,196 | 9.17 | 121,350 | 4.00 | 151,688 | 5.00   \nColony Bank| 280,751 | 9.28 | 121,013 | 4.00 | 151,267 | 5.00   \nAs of December 31, 2022  \nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets  \nConsolidated| $| 318,250 | 15.11 | %| $| 168,498 | 8.00 | %| N/A| N/A  \nColony Bank| 272,812 | 12.99 | 168,014 | 8.00 | $| 210,017 | 10.00 | %  \nTier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets  \nConsolidated| 262,999 | 12.49 | 126,341 | 6.00 | N/A| N/A  \nColony Bank| 256,684 | 12.22 | 126,031 | 6.00 | 168,042 | 8.00   \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets  \nConsolidated| 238,770 | 11.34 | 94,750 | 4.50 | N/A| N/A  \nColony Bank| 256,684 | 12.22 | 94,524 | 4.50 | 136,534 | 6.50   \nTier I Capital to Average Assets  \nConsolidated| 262,999 | 9.17 | 114,721 | 4.00 | N/A| N/A  \nColony Bank| 256,684 | 8.97 | 114,463 | 4.00 | 143,079 | 5.00   \n  \n109\n\nNOTE18.FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF COLONY BANKCORP, INC.

Our Articles and Bylaws are incorporated by reference as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 of which this Exhibit 4.1 is a part. As used in this Exhibit 4.1, the terms “Colony,” “we”, “us” and “our” refer only to Colony Bankcorp, Inc. and not to any existing or future subsidiaries of Colony Bankcorp, Inc.\n\nCommon Stock\n\nAuthorized. Colony has 50,000,000 shares of authorized common stock, $1.00 par value, of which 17,564,182 were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\nVoting Rights; Cumulative Voting. Pursuant to the Colony Bylaws, each outstanding share of Colony common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote. Holders of Colony common stock do not have cumulative voting rights.\n\nBoard of Directors. Under Article 3.3 of the Colony Bylaws, the board of directors shall consist of not less than three (3), nor more than twenty-five (25) persons, with the exact number of directors to be determined from time to time by resolution of the board, or by resolution of the shareholders at any annual or special meeting of shareholders. The directors shall be elected by a majority of votes cast at a meeting where a quorum is present, provided, however, that in the event of a contested election for a director seat, such director shall be elected by a plurality of votes received rather than a majority of votes cast. \n\nDividends. Holders of Colony common stock are entitled to receive dividends if, as and when declared by the board of directors out of any funds legally available for dividends. Holders of Colony common stock are also entitled, upon our liquidation, and after claims of creditors and the preferences of any class or series of preferred stock outstanding at the time of liquidation, to receive pro rata net assets, if any. Colony pays dividends on its common stock only if it has paid or provided for all dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock, for the then current period and, in the case of any cumulative preferred stock, all prior periods.\n\nColony is a legal entity separate and distinct from Colony Bank. There are various restrictions that limit the ability of Colony Bank to finance, pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Colony or other affiliates. In addition, subsidiary banks of holding companies are subject to certain restrictions under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act on any extension of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities thereof and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing of services.\n\nThe principal source of funds from which Colony pays cash dividends are the dividends received from its bank subsidiary, Colony Bank. Consequently, dividends are dependent upon Colony Bank’s earnings, capital needs, and regulatory policies, as well as statutory and regulatory limitations. Federal and state banking laws and regulations restrict the amount of dividends and loans a bank may make to its parent company. Georgia law requires prior approval for a bank to pay dividends where the aggregate amount of dividends to be declared or anticipated to be declared during the current calendar year exceeds fifty (50) percent of its net after-tax profits before dividends for the previous calendar year. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized.\n\nPreemptive Rights; Liquidation. Colony common stock does not carry any preemptive rights enabling a holder to subscribe for or receive shares of Colony common stock. In the event of liquidation, holders of Colony common stock are entitled to share in the distribution of assets remaining after payment of debts and expenses and after required payments to holders of Colony preferred stock, if any such shares are outstanding. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to Colony common stock.\n\nEXHIBIT 4.1\n\nPreferred Stock\n\nUnder the terms of the Colony Articles, Colony has authorized the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value, any part or all of which shares may be established and designated from time to time by the board of directors by filing an amendment to the Articles, which is effective without shareholder action, in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Georgia Business Corporation Code (“GBCC”). If Colony offers preferred stock, it will file the terms of the preferred stock with the SEC, and the prospectus supplement relating to that offering will include a description of the specific terms of the offerings. The Colony Articles authorize the board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock, and to establish such preferences, limitations and relative rights as may be applicable to each series of preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock and the determination of the terms of preferred stock by the board, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock.\n\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\n\nVoting Requirements; Business Combinations or Control Share Acquisition. The GBCC states that in the absence of a greater requirement in the articles of incorporation, a sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of a corporation’s property requires approval by a majority of the shares entitled to vote on the transaction. The Colony Articles do not provide for a greater than majority vote on such a transaction.\n\nRemoval of Directors. Under Article 3.4 of the Colony Bylaws, the entire board of directors or any individual director may be removed from office with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. \n\nVacancies in the Board of Directors. Under Article 3.5 of the Colony Bylaws, the directors, even though less than a quorum, may fill any vacancy on the board of directors, including a vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors, and such appointment by the directors shall continue until the expiration of the term of the director whose place has become vacant, or until the next election of directors by the shareholders and until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or until his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or death.\n\nIn addition, Section 14-2-810 of the GBCC provides that unless the articles of incorporation or a bylaws approved by the shareholders provides otherwise, if a vacancy occurs on a board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors: (i) the shareholders may fill the vacancy; (ii) the board of directors may fill the vacancy; or (iii) if the directors remaining in office constitute fewer than a quorum of the board, they may fill the vacancy by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the directors remaining in office. The GBCC also provides that if the vacant office was held by a director elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the holders of shares of that voting group or the remaining directors elected by that voting group are entitled to vote to fill the vacancy.\n\nAmendment of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. The Colony Articles may be amended in accordance with the GBCC, which generally requires the approval of the Colony board of directors and the holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment. Colony’s Bylaws may be amended, altered, or repealed by the vote or written consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at any annual or special meeting of the shareholders or by the board of directors at any regular or special meeting of the board of directors; provided, however, that if such action is to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, notice of the general nature of the proposed change in the bylaws must be given in the notice of the meeting.\n\nSpecial Meetings of Shareholders. Under the Colony Bylaws, special meetings of shareholders or a special meeting in lieu of the annual meeting of shareholders shall be called by Colony upon the written request of the holders of forty-five percent (45%) or more of all the shares of capital stock entitled to vote in an election of directors. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time by the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board, or the Board of Directors. Colony must give written or printed notice of the place, day and hour of each special shareholders’ meeting no fewer than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the meeting date to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. The notice of a special meeting must state the general nature of the business to be transacted.\n\nShareholder Proposals and Nominations. Under the Colony Bylaws, shareholder proposals must be received by the Colony Board of Directors not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) day, nor earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day, prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding year’s annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the close of business on the tenth \n\nEXHIBIT 4.1\n\n(10th) day following the date on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the meeting was made, whichever occurs first.\n\nLimitations on Directors’ and Officers’ Liability. The Colony Bylaws provide that any person, his heirs, executors, or administrators, may be indemnified or reimbursed by Colony for reasonable expense actually incurred in connection with any action, suit or proceeding, civil or criminal, to which such person shall be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent of Colony, or that such person is or was serving, at the request of Colony, as a director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent of another firm, corporation, trust or other organization or enterprise; provided, however, that no person shall be so indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any matter in such action, suit or proceeding as to which such person shall finally be adjudged to have been guilty of or liable for gross negligence, willful misconduct or criminal acts in the performance of his duties to Colony, or to such other firm, corporation, trust, organization, or enterprise; and provided further, that no person shall be so indemnified or reimbursed in relation to any matter in such action, suit, or proceeding which has been in the subject of a compromise settlement, except with the approval of (i) a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Colony, or (iii) a majority of the members of the board of directors then holding office, excluding the votes of any directors who are parties to the same or substantially the same action, suit or proceeding.\n\nThe Colony Bylaws also provide that expenses incurred in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to above may be paid by Colony in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by the board of directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, trustee, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount unless it shall ultimately be determined that such director, trustee, officer, employee or agent is entitled to be indemnified by Colony as provided above.\n\nThe Colony Bylaws further provide that Colony may purchase and maintain on behalf of a director, officer, employee or agent of Colony insurance against liability asserted against or incurred by that person serving in such capacity for Colony or arising from his status with Colony whether or not Colony would have the power to indemnify that person under the Bylaws.\n\nExhibit 10.12\n\nEMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT\n\n† This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”), dated as of this 24th day of January, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), is by and between Colony Bank (“Employer”), a Georgia Bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Colony Bankcorp, Inc.

The Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the Protective Covenants will be inadequate, and that in the event Employee breaches, or threatens to breach, any of the Protective Covenants, Employer shall have the right and remedy, without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond, to enjoin, preliminarily and permanently, Employee from violating or threatening to violate the Protective Covenants and to have the Protective Covenants specifically enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction, it being agreed that any breach or threatened breach of the Protective Covenants would cause irreparable injury to Employer and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Employer. Employee understands and agrees that if Employee violates any of the obligations set forth in the Protective Covenants, the period of restriction applicable to each obligation violated shall cease to run during the pendency of any litigation \n\nExhibit 10.12\n\nover such violation, provided that such litigation was initiated during the period of restriction. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to Employer at law or in equity Employer’s ability to enforce its rights under the Protective Covenants or applicable law against Employee shall not be impaired in any way by the existence of a claim or cause of action on the part of Employee based on, or arising out of, this Agreement or any other event or transaction. \n\n(ii) Severability and Modification of Covenants. Employee acknowledges and agrees that each of the Protective Covenants is reasonable and valid in time and scope and in all other respects. The Parties agree that it is their intention that the Protective Covenants be enforced in accordance with their terms to the maximum extent permitted by law. Each of the Protective Covenants shall be considered and construed as a separate and independent covenant. Should any part or provision of any of the Protective Covenants be held invalid, void, or unenforceable, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall not render invalid, void, or unenforceable any other part or provision of this Agreement or such Protective Covenant. If any of the provisions of the Protective Covenants should ever be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to exceed the scope permitted by the applicable law, such provision or provisions shall be automatically modified to such lesser scope as such court may deem just and proper for the reasonable protection of Employer’s legitimate business interests and may be enforced by Employer to that extent in the manner described above and all other provisions of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable. \n\n7. Existing Covenants. Employee represents and warrants that Employee’s employment with Employer does not and will not breach any agreement that Employee has with any former employer to keep in confidence proprietary or confidential information or not to compete with any such former employer. Employee will not disclose to Employer or use on its behalf any proprietary or confidential information of any other party required to be kept confidential by Employee. \n\n8. Disclosure of Agreement. Employee acknowledges and agrees that, during the Restricted Period, Employee will disclose the existence and terms of this Agreement to any prospective employer, business partner, investor or lender prior to entering into an employment, partnership or other business relationship with such prospective employer, business partner, investor or lender. Employee further agrees that Employer shall have the right to make any such prospective employer, business partner, investor or lender of Employee aware of the existence and terms of this Agreement. \n\n9. Miscellaneous. \n\n(a) Applicable Law; Forum Selection; Consent to Jurisdiction. The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles. The Parties that the exclusive forum for any action to enforce this Agreement, as well as any action relating to or arising out of this Agreement, shall be the state or federal courts of the State of Georgia. With respect to any such court action, Employee hereby (a) irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts; (b) consents to venue; and (c) waives any other requirement (whether imposed by statute, rule of court, or otherwise) with respect to personal jurisdiction or venue. The Parties hereto further agree that the state and federal courts of the State of Georgia are convenient forums for any dispute that may arise herefrom and that neither party shall raise as a defense that such courts are not convenient forums. \n\n(b) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement.\n\n(c) Waiver. Failure of either Party to insist, in one or more instances, on performance by the other in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any right granted in this Agreement or of the future performance of any such term or condition or of any other term or condition of this Agreement, unless such waiver is contained in a writing signed by the Party making the waiver.\n\n(d) Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between Employer and Employee with respect to the subject matter hereof and, from and after the date hereof, this Agreement shall \n\nExhibit 10.12\n\nsupersede any other agreement, written or oral, between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Prior Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their respective successors and legal representatives. \n\n(e) Assignment. This Agreement can be assigned by Employer and shall be binding and inure to the benefit of Employer, its successors and assigns. No right, obligation or duty of this Agreement may be assigned by Employee without the prior written consent of Employer. \n\n(f) Notices. Any notice required or desired to be delivered under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, by courier service, by registered mail, return receipt requested, or by telecopy and shall be effective upon actual receipt by the party to which such notice shall be directed, and shall be addressed as follows (or to such other address as the party entitled to notice shall hereafter designate in accordance with the terms hereof): \n\nIf to Employer: Chief Executive Officer \n\n115 S. Grant Street \n\nFitzgerald, GA 31750 \n\nIf to Employee: Derek Shelnutt \n\nCurrent address on file with Employer \n\n(g) Construction. The Parties understand and agree that because they both have been given the opportunity to have counsel review and revise this Agreement, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement. Instead, the language of all parts of this Agreement shall be construed as a whole, and according to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against either of the parties. \n\n(h) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and it shall not be necessary that the signatures of the Parties hereto be contained on any one counterpart hereof. Each counterpart shall be deemed an original but all counterparts together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature page of any such counterpart, or any electronic facsimile thereof, may be attached or appended to any other counterpart to complete a fully executed counterpart of this Agreement, and any telecopy or other electronic transmission of any signature shall be deemed an original and shall bind such Party. \n\n(i) Third Party Beneficiaries. The parties acknowledge and agree that any direct and indirect parent companies or subsidiaries of Employer are intended to be beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall have every right to enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. \n\n(j) Acknowledgements. Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee has read and reviewed this Agreement in its entirety, and that Employee has been given the opportunity to ask Employer questions about this Agreement. Employee further acknowledges and agrees that Employee has been given an opportunity to consult with an attorney of Employee’s choice regarding this Agreement. \n\n10. Code Section 280G. \n\n(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by Employer to or for the benefit of Employee (whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (such benefits, payments or distributions are hereinafter referred to as “Payments”) would, if paid, be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then, prior to the making of any Payments to Employee, a calculation shall be made comparing (X) the net after-tax benefit to Employee of the Payments after payment by Employee of the Excise Tax, to (Y) the net after-tax benefit to Employee if the Payments had been limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax. If the amount calculated under (X) above is less than the amount calculated under (Y) above, then the Payments shall be limited to the extent necessary to avoid being subject to the Excise Tax (the \n\nExhibit 10.12\n\n“Reduced Amount”). The reduction of the Payments due hereunder, if applicable, shall be made by first reducing cash Payments and then, to the extent necessary, reducing those Payments having the next highest ratio of Parachute Value (as defined below) to actual present value of such Payments as of the date of the Change in Control, as determined by the Determination Firm (as defined in Section 10(b)(ii)) below). For purposes of this Section 10, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code. For purposes of this Section 10, the “Parachute Value” of a Payment means the present value as of the date of the Change in Control of the portion of such Payment that constitutes a “parachute payment” under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, as determined by the Determination Firm for purposes of determining whether and to what extent the Excise Tax will apply to such Payment. \n\n(b) All determinations required to be made under this Section 10, including whether an Excise Tax would otherwise be imposed, whether the Payments shall be reduced, the amount of the Reduced Amount, and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determinations, shall be made by an accounting firm or compensation consulting firm selected by Employer (the “Determination Firm”) which shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to Employer and Employee within 15 business days after the receipt of notice from Employee that a Payment is due to be made, or such earlier time as is requested by Employer. All fees and expenses of the Determination Firm shall be borne solely by Employer. Any determination by the Determination Firm shall be binding upon Employer and Employee. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Determination Firm hereunder, it is possible that Payments which Employee was entitled to, but did not receive pursuant to Section 10, could have been made without the imposition of the Excise Tax (“Underpayment”), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. In such event, the Determination Firm shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by Employer to or for the benefit of Employee but no later than March 15 of the year after the year in which the Underpayment is determined to exist, which is when the legally binding right to such Underpayment arises. \n\n(c) In the event that the provisions of Code Section 280G and 4999 or any successor provisions are repealed without succession, this Section 10 shall be of no further force or effect.”\n\n11. Code Section 409A. \n\n(a) General. This Agreement shall be interpreted and administered in a manner so that any amount or benefit payable hereunder shall be paid or provided in a manner that is either exempt from or compliant with the requirements Section 409A of the Code and applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance and Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (and any applicable transition relief under Section 409A of the Code). Nevertheless, the tax treatment of the benefits provided under the Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed. Neither Employer nor its directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be held liable for any taxes, interest, penalties or other monetary amounts owed by Employee as a result of the application of Section 409A of the Code. \n\n(b) Definitional Restrictions. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any amount or benefit that would constitute non-exempt “deferred compensation” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code (“Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation”) would otherwise be payable or distributable hereunder, or a different form of payment of such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation would be effected, by reason of a Change in Control or Employee’s termination of employment, such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation will not be payable or distributable to Employee, and/or such different form of payment will not be effected, by reason of such circumstance unless the circumstances giving rise to such Change in Control or termination of employment, as the case may be, meet any description or definition of “change in control event” or “separation from service”, as the case may be, in Section 409A of the Code and applicable regulations (without giving effect to any elective provisions that may be available under such definition). If this provision prevents the payment or distribution of any Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation, or the application of a different form of payment, such payment or distribution shall be made at the time and in the form that would have applied absent the non-409A-conforming event. \n\nExhibit 10.12\n\n(c) Treatment of Installment Payments. Each payment of termination benefits under Section 5(b) of this Agreement shall be considered a separate payment, as described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-2(b)(2), for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. \n\n(d) Timing of Release of Claims. Whenever in this Agreement a payment or benefit is conditioned on Employee’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, such release must be executed and all revocation periods shall have expired within 60 days after Employee’s date of termination; failing which such payment or benefit shall be forfeited. If such payment or benefit constitutes Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation, then such payment or benefit shall be made (or in the case of installment payments, installments that would have otherwise been payable during such 60-day period shall be accumulated and paid) on the 60th day after Employee’s date of termination provided such release shall have been executed and such revocation periods shall have expired. If such payment or benefit is exempt from Section 409A of the Code, Employer may elect to make or commence payment at any time during such 60-day period. \n\n(e) Six-Month Delay in Certain Circumstances. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit that would constitute Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation would otherwise be payable or distributable under this Agreement by reason of Employee’s separation from service during a period in which Employee is a Specified Employee (as defined below), then, subject to any permissible acceleration of payment by Employer under Treas. Reg. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ii) (domestic relations order), (j)(4)(iii) (conflicts of interest), or (j)(4)(vi) (payment of employment taxes): (i) the amount of such Non-Exempt Deferred Compensation that would otherwise be payable during the six-month period immediately following Employee’s separation from service will be accumulated through and paid or provided on the first day of the seventh month following Employee’s separation from service (or, if Employee dies during such period, within 30 days after Employee’s death) (in either case, the “Required Delay Period”); and (ii) the normal payment or distribution schedule for any remaining payments or distributions will resume at the end of the Required Delay Period. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Specified Employee” has the meaning given such term in Code Section 409A and the final regulations thereunder. \n\n11. Regulatory Action. \n\n(a) If Employee is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of Employer’s affairs by an order issued under Section 8(e)(4) or 8(g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(4) and (g)(1)), all obligations of Employer under this Agreement shall terminate, as of the effective date of such order. \n\n(b) If Employee is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of Employer’s affairs by a notice served under Section 8(e)(3) or 8(g)(1) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(3) and (g)(1)), all obligations of Employer under this Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service, unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the Employer shall reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations which were suspended. \n\n(c) If Employer is in default (as defined in Section 3(x)(1) of the FDIA), all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date of default. \n\n(d) All obligations under this Agreement shall be terminated, except to the extent a determination is made that continuation of the Agreement is necessary for the continued operation of the Employer (1) by the director of the FDIC or Employee’s or Employee’s designee (the “Director”), at the time the FDIC enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of Employer under the authority contained in 13(c) of the FDIA; or (2) by the Director, at the time the Director approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to operation of Employer when Employer is determined by the Director to be in an unsafe and unsound condition. \n\n(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no payments shall be made pursuant to any provision herein in contravention of the requirements of Section 2[18(k)] of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1828(k)). In particular, the provisions pertaining to the potential for payments shall have no force or effect as long as \n\nExhibit 10.12\n\neither the agreement concerning the potential for payments or the actual payment of such amounts would be considered a “golden parachute payment,” with the meaning of 12 C.F.R. Section 359.1(f). \n\n[Signatures on following page] \n\nExhibit 10.12\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have duly executed and delivered this Agreement. \n\nCOLONY BANK \n\nBy: /s/ T.

COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\n\nEach current and former executive officer of Colony Bankcorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") shall repay or forfeit, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any incentive-based compensation (\"Compensation\") erroneously received by him or her as an executive officer on or after October 2, 2023, if:\n\na. The Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws;\n\nb. The Compensation was paid, earned, granted or vested based in whole or in part on the achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement of the Company's financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission;\n\nc. The amount of Compensation received by the executive officer exceeds the amount the executive officer would have received had the Compensation been determined based on the accounting restatement. (i.e., the executive officer received Compensation that he or she would not have received if calculated based on the restated financials).\n\nThe Company shall recover the erroneously awarded Compensation reasonably promptly and without regard to fault or culpability. The Company shall not indemnify any current or former executive officer against the loss of erroneously awarded Compensation.\n\nRecovery under this Policy shall be required for both (i) restatements that correct errors that are material to previously issued financial statements, and (ii) restatements that correct errors that are not material to previously issued financial statements but would result in a material misstatement if the errors were left uncorrected in the current report or the error correction was recognized in the current period.\n\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement to correct a material error, the Company must recover from current and former executive officers Compensation received during the three fiscal years preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare said restatement. For the purposes of this Policy, the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement is the earlier to occur of:\n\na. The date the Company's board of directors (the \"Board\"), a committee of the Board, or the officer or officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws; or\n\nb.The date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an accounting restatement.\n\nFor the purposes of this Policy, Compensation is deemed received in the fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure used to determine the Compensation amount is attained, even if the grant or payment of the Compensation occurs after the end of that period. For incentive-based compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, the Company may use a reasonable estimate of the effect of the restatement on the applicable measure to determine the amount to be recovered.\n\nFor the purposes of this Policy, \"executive officer\" shall mean the Company's president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function, any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company's subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the Company if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company.\n\nThe Company must recover erroneously awarded Compensation pursuant to this Policy except to the extent that (i) the Compensation was awarded pursuant to a tax-qualified retirement plan and said plan's benefits may not be assigned or alienated without losing such qualification, or (ii) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, and (iii) the Company's Compensation Committee, or if no such committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board of the Company, has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable. Before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of erroneously awarded compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq.\n\nEach compensation agreement or other document setting forth the terms and conditions of any incentive-based compensation granted to an executive officer shall be deemed to include the provisions of this Policy. The remedy specified in this Policy shall not be exclusive and shall be in addition to every other right or remedy at law or in equity that may be available to the Company.\n\nThe Board acknowledges that this Policy will be amended if and as required to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\n(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nPresentation\n\nColony Bankcorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a bank holding company located in Fitzgerald, Georgia. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Colony Bank, Fitzgerald, Georgia (the “Bank”). The “Company” or “our,” as used herein, includes Colony Bank, except where the context requires otherwise.\n\nAll adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the interim consolidated financial statements, have been included and fairly and accurately present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. All significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") utilized in the commercial banking industry for interim financial information and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information or notes required for complete financial statements. \n\nThe results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. These statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”).\n\nNature of Operations\n\nThe Bank provides a full range of retail, commercial and mortgage banking services as well as government guaranteed lending, consumer insurance, wealth management and merchant services for consumers and small- to medium-size businesses located primarily in north, central, south and coastal Georgia, Birmingham, Alabama and Tallahassee and the Florida Panhandle. The Bank is headquartered in Fitzgerald, Georgia with locations in the Georgia cities of Albany, Ashburn, Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Broxton, Cedartown, Centerville, Chickamauga, Columbus, Cordele, Douglas, Eastman, Fayetteville, Fitzgerald, LaGrange, Leesburg, Macon, Manchester, Moultrie, Quitman, Rochelle, Rockmart, Savannah, Statesboro, Sylvester, Thomaston, Tifton, Valdosta and Warner Robins along with loan production offices in Birmingham, Alabama and Tallahassee, Florida. Lending and investing activities are funded primarily by deposits gathered through its retail banking office network.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans and fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including goodwill impairment.\n\nReclassifications\n\nIn certain instances, amounts reported in prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations selected for 2024. Such reclassifications have not materially affected previously reported stockholders’ equity or net income.\n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\n\nConcentrations of credit risk can exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers, certain types of collateral, certain types of industries, or certain geographic regions. The Company has a concentration in real estate loans as well as a geographic concentration that could pose an adverse credit risk. At September 30, 2024, approximately 83% of the Company’s loan portfolio was concentrated in loans secured by real estate. A substantial portion of borrowers’ ability to \n\n11\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nhonor their contractual obligations is dependent upon the viability of the real estate economic sector. Management continues to monitor these concentrations and has considered these concentrations in its allowance for credit loss analysis.\n\nThe success of the Company is dependent, to a certain extent, upon the economic conditions in the geographic markets it serves. Adverse changes in the economic conditions in these geographic markets would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The operating results of the Company depend primarily on its net interest income. Accordingly, operations are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding the exposure to changes in the interest rate environment.\n\nAt times, the Company may have cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions in excess of federal deposit insurance limits. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions whose credit ratings are monitored by management to minimize credit risk.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses (\"ACL\") – Loans\n\nThe current expected credit loss (“CECL”) approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). It replaced the incurred loss approach’s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred. The estimate of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. The Company then considers whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the historical period used. The Company also considers future economic conditions and portfolio performance as part of a reasonable and supportable forecast period.\n\nThe ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the ACL when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nManagement determines the ACL balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit behaviors along with model judgments provide the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to modeled loss estimates may be made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in economic conditions, property values, or other relevant factors. For the majority of loans and leases the ACL is calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology applied at a loan level with a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and a two-year straight-line reversion period.\n\nThe ACL-loans are measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company has identified the following portfolio segments and calculates the ACL for each using a discounted cash flow methodology at the loan level, with loss rates, prepayment assumptions and curtailment assumptions driven by each loan’s collateral type:\n\n•Construction, land & land development - Risks common to construction, land & development loans are cost overruns, changes in market demand for property, inadequate long-term financing arrangements and declines in real estate values.\n\n•Other commercial real estate - Loans in this category are susceptible to business failures and declines in general economic conditions, including declines in real estate value, declines in occupancy rates, and lack of suitable alternative use for the property.\n\n•Residential real estate - Residential real estate loans are susceptible to weakening general economic conditions, increases in unemployment rates and declining real estate values.\n\n•Commercial, financial & agricultural - Risks to this loan category include the inability to monitor the condition of the collateral, which often consists of inventory, accounts receivable and other non-real estate assets. Equipment and inventory obsolescence can also pose a risk. Declines in general economic conditions and other events can cause cash flows to fall to levels insufficient to service debt.\n\n12\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\n•Consumer and other - Risks common to consumer direct loans include unemployment and changes in local economic conditions as well as the inability to monitor collateral consisting of personal property.\n\nWhen management determines that foreclosure is probable or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the reporting date and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, adjusted for selling costs as appropriate.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\n\nFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.\n\nManagement estimates expected credit losses on commitments to extend credit over the contractual period during which the Company is exposed to credit risk on the underlying commitments. The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The ACL is calculated using the same aggregate reserve rates calculated for the funded portion of loans at the portfolio level applied to the amount of commitments expected to fund.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Held-to-Maturity (\"HTM\") Securities\n\nManagement measures current expected credit losses on HTM debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. The estimate of current expected credit losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Management classifies the HTM portfolio into the following major security types: U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, State, county & municipal securities, and Mortgage-backed securities. Accrued interest receivable on HTM debt is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nAll of the residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities held by the Company as HTM are issued by U.S. government agencies and government sponsored entities. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses. The state and political subdivision securities are also highly rated by major rating agencies.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Available-for-Sale (\"AFS\") Securities\n\nFor AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any amount of unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an ACL is recognized in other comprehensive income. Accrued interest receivable on AFS debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\n\nChanges in the ACL are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the ACL when management believes the uncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\n\n13\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nDerivatives\n\nAt the inception of a derivative contract, the Company designates the derivative as one of three types based on the Company's intentions and belief as to likely effectiveness as a hedge. These three types are (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (\"cash flow hedge\"), (2) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (\"fair value hedge\"), or (3) an instrument with no hedging designation (\"non-designated derivative\"). For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. For a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings as fair values change. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated are reported currently in earnings, as noninterest income. \n\nNet cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest expense, based on the item being hedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported in noninterest income or noninterest expense. Cash flows from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same manner as the items being hedged.\n\nThe Company formally documents the relationship between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking hedge transactions at the inception of the hedging relationship. This documentation includes linking cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. The Company discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is settled or terminated, a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, a hedged firm commitment is no longer firm or treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended.\n\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as interest expense. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or losses that were accumulated in OCI are amortized into earnings over the same periods which the hedged transactions will affect earnings.\n\nChanges in Accounting Principles\n\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (\"ASU 2020-04\"). This ASU provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. It provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The updated guidance was originally effective for all entities from March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06 which deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Company has adopted this ASU with no material impact to its financial statements.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07\"). This ASU was issued to improve segment reporting disclosures. The amendments in this ASU improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment information including significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker as well as the amount and composition of other segment items on an annual and interim basis for all public entities to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. Retrospective application is required in all prior periods unless impracticable to do so. The amendments in this standard will be effective for the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the incremental segment information that will be required to be disclosed as well as the impact to the Segment Reporting footnote.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-09\"). This ASU was issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The ASU addresses investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information.

Management first evaluates whether they intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell an impaired security \n\n17\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nbefore recovering its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the entire amount of unrealized loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the security's amortized cost basis. If either of the above criteria is not met, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value is attributable to credit or resulted from other factors. The Company does not intend to sell these investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these securities prior to recovery or maturity. Based on management's review, the Company's available-for-sale securities have no expected credit losses and no related allowance for credit losses has been established. \n\nThe Company uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for debt securities held-to-maturity considering the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectibility of the portfolio. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the held-to-maturity portfolio. The Company monitors the held-to-maturity portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation account would need to be recorded. Based on management's review, the Company's held-to-maturity securities have no expected credit losses and no related allowance for credit losses has been established.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, there were 243 available-for-sale securities and 146 held-to-maturity securities that had unrealized losses. These securities are guaranteed by either the U.S. Government, other governments or U.S. corporations. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition. The unrealized losses are largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased. As management has the ability to hold debt securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future if classified as available-for-sale, no declines are due to reasons of credit quality. \n\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), as amended on January 1, 2023 which included evaluation of expected credit losses on debt securities. As part of the Company's calculated credit losses, the allowance for credit losses on investment securities was determined to be de minimis due to the high credit quality of the portfolio, which includes securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. treasury and U.S. government agencies and high quality municipalities. Therefore, no allowance for credit losses was recorded as of September 30, 2024. See Note 1 for additional details on the allowance for credit losses as it relates to the securities portfolio.\n\n(3) Loans\n\nThe following table presents the composition of loans segregated by class of loans, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\n(dollars in thousands)| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 196,390 | $| 247,146   \nOther commercial real estate| 1,012,466 | 974,375   \nTotal commercial real estate| 1,208,856 | 1,221,521   \nResidential real estate| 349,777 | 356,234   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural | 242,389 | 242,756   \nConsumer and other| 85,015 | 62,959   \nTotal Loans| $| 1,886,037 | $| 1,883,470   \n  \n18\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable for loans totaled $8.8 million for both periods and is included in the \"Other assets\" line item on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. \n\nCommercial, financial & agricultural loans are extended to a diverse group of businesses within the Company’s market area. These loans are often underwritten based on the borrower’s ability to service the debt from income from the business. Real estate construction loans often require loan funds to be advanced prior to completion of the project. Due to uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, changes in interest rates and other economic conditions, these loans often pose a higher risk than other types of loans. Consumer and other loans are originated at the Bank level. \n\nCredit Quality Indicators. As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of the loan portfolio, management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends related to (1) the risk grade assigned to commercial and consumer loans, (2) the level of classified commercial loans, (3) net charge-offs, (4) nonperforming loans, and (5) the general economic conditions in the Company’s geographic markets.\n\nThe Company uses a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each of its loans. For commercial loans over $500,000, loans are graded on a scale of 1 to 10. A description of the general characteristics of the grades is as follows:\n\n•Grades 1, 2 and 3 - Loans with these assigned risk grades range from virtual absence of risk to minimal risk. Such loans may be secured by Company-issued and controlled certificates of deposit or properly margined equity securities or bonds. Other loans comprising these grades are made to companies that have been in existence for a long period of time with many years of consecutive profits and strong equity, good liquidity, excellent debt service ability and unblemished past performance, or to exceptionally strong individuals with collateral of unquestioned value that fully secures the loans. Loans in this category fall into the “pass” classification.\n\n•Grades 4 and 5 - Loans assigned these “pass” risk grades are made to borrowers with acceptable credit quality and risk. The risk ranges from loans with no significant weaknesses in repayment capacity and collateral protection to acceptable loans with one or more risk factors considered to be more than average. These loans are also included in the “pass” classification.\n\n•Grade 6 - This grade includes “special mention” loans on management’s watch list and is intended to be used on a temporary basis for pass grade loans where risk-modifying action is intended in the short-term.\n\n•Grades 7 and 8 - These grades include “substandard” loans in accordance with regulatory guidelines. This category includes borrowers with well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the payment of the debt in accordance with the agreed terms. Loans considered to be impaired are assigned grade 8, and these loans often have assigned loss allocations as part of the allowance for credit losses. Generally, loans on which interest accrual has been stopped would be included in this grade range.\n\n•Grades 9 and 10 - These grades correspond to regulatory classification definitions of “doubtful” and “loss,” respectively. In practice, any loan with these grades would be for a very short period of time, and generally the Company has no loans with these assigned grades. Management manages the Company’s problem loans in such a \n\n19\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nway that uncollectible loans or uncollectible portions of loans are charged off immediately with any residual, collectible amounts assigned a risk grade of 7 or 8. \n\nFor smaller commercial loans (under $500,000) and consumer loans, the Company began using behavioral based risk grades during the second quarter of 2024. These loans are assigned risk grades of 98 or 99 based on payment performance with the Company.\n\n◦Grade 98 - Loans assigned this risk grade indicates a \"pass\" credit.\n\n◦Grade 99 - Loans assigned this risk grade indicates a \"substandard\" credit and is moved to a nonaccrual status.\n\nThe following tables present the loan portfolio segregated by class of loans and the risk category of term loans by vintage year, which is the year of origination or most recent renewal, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Loan risk grades are subject to review at various times throughout the year as part of the Company’s ongoing loan review process. Loans with an assigned risk grade of 7, 8, 9, 10 or 99 and an outstanding balance of $500,000 or more are reassessed on a quarterly basis. During this reassessment process individual reserves may be identified and placed against certain loans which are not considered impaired.\n\nIn assessing the overall economic condition of the markets in which it operates, the Company monitors the unemployment rates for its major service areas. The unemployment rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis as part of the allowance for credit loss determination.\n\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due or when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory guidelines. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due.\n\nCollateral-Dependent Loans\n\nWe classify a loan as collateral-dependent when our borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral. Our commercial loans have collateral that is comprised of real estate and business assets. Our consumer loans have collateral that is substantially comprised of residential real estate.

Interest income recorded on nonaccrual loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $390,000 and $265,000, respectively. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to determine the allowance for credit losses. An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification.\n\nBecause the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies loans by providing principal forgiveness on certain of its real estate loans. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses.\n\nIn some cases, the Company will modify a certain loan by providing multiple types of concessions. Typically, one type of concession, such as a term extension, is granted initially. If the borrower continues to experience financial difficulty, another concession, such as principal forgiveness, may be granted. Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan, or portion of a loan, has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan, or portion of the loan, is written off.\n\nThe following tables present loans modified due to a financial difficulty under the above terms during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThree months ended September 30, 2024  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| Term Extension| Payment Delay| Term Extension and Payment Delay| Total*  \nCommercial real estate| $| 224 | $| — | $| — | $| 224   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| — | 1,114 | 558 | 1,672   \nTotal Loans| $| 224 | $| 1,114 | $| 558 | $| 1,896   \n*less than .05% of total class of receivable  \n  \nThere were a total of six loans in the above categories for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The changes in loss rates used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses during this period were modeled using historical data from peer banks and macroeconomic forecast data obtained from a third party vendor, which were then applied to Colony's recent default experience as a starting point. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects that the markets in which it operates will experience stable economic and unemployment conditions with the trend of delinquencies returning to more normalized levels, over the next two years. Management adjusted the historical loss experience for these expectations. No reversion adjustments were necessary, as the starting point for the Company's estimate was a cumulative loss rate covering the expected contractual term of the portfolio. \n\nThe Company determines its individual reserves during its quarterly review of substandard loans. This process involves reviewing all loans with a risk grade of 7, 8, 9, 10 or 99 and an outstanding balance of $500,000 or more, regardless of the loans impairment classification. \n\nThe Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines of credit, commitments to extend future credit, as well as both standby and commercial letters of credit when there is a contractual obligation to extend credit and when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable. The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in computing the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments is separately classified on the balance sheet within other liabilities.\n\n27\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\n(5) Derivatives\n\nAs part of its asset liability management activities, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps to help manage its interest rate risk position and mitigate exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions. The Company entered into two interest rate swaps during the second quarter of 2023, to hedge the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") interest rate risk for its short-term funding over the term of these cash flow hedges. The Company entered into two additional interest rate swaps during the third quarter of 2024, one of which was designated as a cash flow hedge and the other a fair value hedge. Fair value hedging relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of an asset or liability. \n\nThe notional amount of an interest rate swap does not represent the amount exchanged by the parties. The exchange of cash flows is determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the interest rate swap agreements. \n\nOn June 23, 2023, the Company entered into a five-year interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $25.0 million. On June 26, 2023, the Company entered into a three-year interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $25.0 million. Both of the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges of certain variable rate liabilities.\n\nOn September 6, 2024, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $30.0 million with maturity dates ranging from one to two years. This swap was designated as a cash flow hedge of certain variable rate liabilities. On August 30, 2024, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount totaling $25.4 million with maturity dates ranging from three to 3.5 years. This swap was designated as a fair value hedge of certain fixed rate assets.\n\nThe derivatives are recorded in \"Other liabilities\" on the Company's balance sheet and have a total value of $1.1 million as of September 30, 2024, with $879,000 representing cash flow hedges and $175,000 representing fair value hedges.\n\nGains were recorded on the cash flow hedges, which totaled $199,000 and $550,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $164,000 and $173,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Amounts reported in accumulated OCI related to swaps are reclassified to interest income or expense as interest payments are made on the Bank's fixed rate assets and variable rate liabilities. \n\nThe following table presents the amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of income and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income relating to the interest rate swaps for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(dollars in thousands)| 2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nCash flow hedging relationships  \nAmount of gain(loss) recognized in OCI, net of tax| $| 1,052 | $| 482 | $| (330)| $| 681   \nAmount of gain reclassified from OCI to interest expense, net of tax| 159 | 128 | $| 440 | 139   \nFair value hedging relationships  \nAmount of gain(loss) recognized in OCI, net of tax| (130)| — | $| (130)| —   \n  \n29\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC.

As collateral on the outstanding FHLB advances, the Company has provided a blanket lien on its portfolio of qualifying residential first mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, farmland loans, multifamily loans and HELOC loans. At September 30, 2024, the lendable collateral value of those loans pledged is $193.1 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had remaining credit availability from the FHLB of $564.3 million. The Company may be required to pledge additional qualifying collateral in order to utilize the full amount of the remaining credit line.\n\nThe Company's debentures issued in connection with trust preferred securities are recorded as other borrowings on the consolidated balance sheets, but, subject to certain limitations, qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $24.2 million of debentures underlying trust preferred securities were outstanding. The proceeds from the offerings were used to fund certain acquisitions, pay off holding company debt and inject capital into the bank subsidiary. The debentures underlying the trust preferred securities require quarterly interest payments.\n\nThe Company also has fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes which are due 2032 (the \"Notes\"). The Notes bear a fixed rate of 5.25% for the first five years and reset quarterly thereafter to the then current three-month SOFR, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 265 basis points for the five-year floating term. The Company is entitled to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on any interest payment date on or after May 20, 2027, or at any time, in whole but not in part, upon certain other specified events. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $38.8 million and $39.2 million, respectively, of the Notes, net of debt issuance costs were outstanding. The Notes are recorded as other borrowings on the consolidated balance sheets and, subject to certain limitations, qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes.\n\nThe aggregate stated maturities of other borrowed money at September 30, 2024 are as follows:(dollars in thousands)  \n---  \nYear| Amount  \n2024| $| 50,000   \n2025| —   \n2026| 25,000   \n2027| 15,000   \n2028| 65,000   \n2029 and After| 93,016   \n$| 248,016   \n  \nThe Company also has available federal funds lines of credit with various financial institutions totaling $64.5 million, with no outstanding balance at September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company has the ability to borrow funds from the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) of Atlanta utilizing the discount window. The discount window is an instrument of monetary policy that allows eligible institutions to borrow money from the FRB on a short-term basis to meet temporary liquidity shortages caused by internal or external disruptions. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $118.8 million borrowing capacity available under this arrangement, with no outstanding balances. The Company would be required to pledge certain available-for-sale investment securities as collateral under this agreement.\n\n30\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\n(7) Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of restricted stock.\n\nThe following table presents earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.(dollars in thousands, except per share data)| Three Months EndedSeptember 30,| Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,  \n---|---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNumerator  \nNet income available to common stockholders| $| 5,629 | $| 5,804 | $| 16,436 | $| 16,149   \nDenominator  \nWeighted average number of common shares  \nOutstanding for basic earnings per common share| 17,587,902 | 17,569,493 | 17,566,452 | 17,581,817   \nWeighted-average number of shares outstanding for diluted earnings per common share| 17,587,902 | 17,569,493 | 17,566,452 | 17,581,817   \nEarnings per share - basic| $| 0.32 | $| 0.33 | $| 0.94 | $| 0.92   \nEarnings per share - diluted| $| 0.32 | $| 0.33 | $| 0.94 | $| 0.92   \n  \n(8) Commitments and Contingencies\n\nCredit-Related Financial Instruments. The Company is a party to credit related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral held varies, but may include cash or cash equivalents, negotiable instruments, real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, oil, gas and mineral interests, property, plant, and equipment.\n\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk: \n\n31\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nContract Amount  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \nLoan commitments| $| 331,920 | $| 362,878   \nLetters of credit| 5,045 | 5,656   \n  \nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer.\n\nUnfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed.\n\nStandby and performance letters of credit are conditional lending commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Essentially all letters of credit issued have expiration dates within one year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.\n\nLegalContingencies. In the ordinary course of business, there are various legal proceedings pending against the Company and the Bank. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position.\n\n(9) Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\n\nGenerally accepted accounting standards in the U.S. require disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the face of the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of the Company and the Bank’s financial instruments are detailed hereafter. Where quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. The use of discounted cash flows can be significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles related to Fair Value Measurements define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\n\n•Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\n•Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n\n•Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and represent the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\n\n32\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nThe following disclosures should not be considered a surrogate of the liquidation value of the Company, but rather a good-faith estimate of the increase or decrease in value of financial instruments held by the Company since purchase, origination or issuance.\n\nCash and short-term investments – For cash, due from banks, bank-owned deposits and federal funds sold, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value and is classified as Level 1.\n\nInvestment securities – Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices where available and classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments and classified as Level 2. If a comparable is not available, the investment securities are classified as Level 3.\n\nOther investments– The fair value of other bank stock approximates carrying value and is classified as Level 2. Fair values for investment funds are based on quoted market prices where available and classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments and classified as Level 2. If a comparable is not available, the investment securities are classified as Level 3.\n\nLoans held for sale – The fair value of loans held for sale is determined on outstanding commitments from third party investors in the secondary markets and is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\n\nLoans, net – The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings. For variable rate loans, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Most loans are classified as Level 3.\n\nDeposits – The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date and is classified as Level 2. The fair value of deposits is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities and is classified as Level 2.\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances– The fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank advances is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar advances would be obtained. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are classified as Level 2.\n\nOther borrowings – The fair value of other borrowings is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows using an estimated interest rate based on current rates available to the Company for debt of similar remaining maturities and collateral terms. Other borrowings are classified as Level 2 due to their expected maturities.\n\nDerivative instruments – The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments. The variable cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2.\n\nDisclosures of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis, are required in the financial statements.\n\n33\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC.

These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on many judgments. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.\n\nFair value estimates are based on existing on and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments include deferred income taxes and premises and equipment. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.\n\n34\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy:\n\nSecurities – Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 inputs include securities that have quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flow. Examples of such instruments, which would generally be classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include certain collateralized mortgage and debt obligations and certain high-yield debt securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. When measuring fair value, the valuation techniques available under the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used. The Company’s evaluations are based on market data and the Company employs combinations of these approaches for its valuation methods depending on the asset class.\n\nCollateral dependent loans – Loans which the Company has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan’s collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third-party appraisals of the properties, or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.\n\nOther Real Estate Owned – Other real estate owned assets are adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs upon transfer of the loans to other real estate owned. Typically, an external, third-party appraisal is performed on the collateral upon transfer into the other real estate owned account to determine the asset’s fair value. Subsequent adjustments to the collateral’s value may be based upon either updated third-party appraisals or management’s knowledge of the collateral and the current real estate market conditions. Appraised amounts used in determining the asset’s fair value, whether internally or externally prepared, are discounted 10% to account for selling and marketing costs. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. Because of the high degree of judgment required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned assets and because of the relationship between fair value and general economic conditions, we consider the fair value of other real estate owned assets to be highly sensitive to changes in market conditions.\n\n35\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n\n(10) Segment Information\n\nThe Company’s operating segments include banking, mortgage banking and small business specialty lending division. The reportable segments are determined by the products and services offered, and internal reporting. The Bank segment derives its revenues from the delivery of full-service financial services, including retail and commercial banking services and deposit accounts. The Mortgage Banking segment derives its revenues from the origination and sales of residential mortgage loans held for sale. The Small Business Specialty Lending Division segment derives its revenue from the origination, sales and servicing of Small Business Administration loans and other government guaranteed loans. Segment performance is evaluated using net interest income and noninterest income. Income taxes are assessed based on income before income taxes, and indirect expenses (including management fees) are allocated based on various internal factors for each segment. Transactions among segments are made at fair value. Information reported internally for performance assessment follows. The following tables present information reported internally for performance assessment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n(dollars in thousands)| Bank| MortgageBanking| SmallBusinessSpecialtyLendingDivision| Totals  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024  \nNet Interest Income| $| 17,152 | $| 67 | $| 1,322 | $| 18,541   \nProvision for Credit Losses| 698 | — | 52 | 750   \nNoninterest Income| 5,494 | 1,812 | 2,776 | 10,082   \nNoninterest Expenses| 17,075 | 1,533 | 2,227 | 20,835   \nIncome Taxes| 1,017 | 71 | 321 | 1,409   \nSegment Profit| $| 3,856 | $| 275 | $| 1,498 | $| 5,629   \n  \n(dollars in thousands)| Bank| MortgageBanking| SmallBusinessSpecialtyLendingDivision| Totals  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023  \nNet Interest Income| $| 18,778 | $| 52 | $| 791 | $| 19,621   \nProvision for Credit Losses| 286 | — | 714 | 1,000   \nNoninterest Income| 6,233 | 1,725 | 1,760 | 9,718   \nNoninterest Expenses| 16,653 | 2,040 | 2,188 | 20,881   \nIncome Taxes| 1,777 | (53)| (70)| 1,654   \nSegment Profit| $| 6,295 | $| (210)| $| (281)| $| 5,804   \n  \n39\n\nCOLONY BANKCORP, INC.

Upon approval by regulatory authorities, the Bank may pay cash dividends to the parent company in excess of regulatory limitations.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank were categorized as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action in effect at such time. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the Company and the Bank must have exceeded the well-capitalized guideline ratios in effect at the time, as set forth in the tables below, and have met certain other requirements. Management believes that the Company and the Bank exceeded all well-capitalized requirements at September 30, 2024, and there have been no conditions or events since quarter-end that would change the status of well-capitalized.\n\nThe following tables summarize regulatory capital information as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 on a consolidated basis and for the subsidiary, as defined.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe purpose of this discussion and analysis is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition of Colony Bankcorp, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary, Colony Bank, from December 31, 2023 through September 30, 2024 and on our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K, and information presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly the unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in Item 1.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “strive,” “projection,” “goal,” “target,” “outlook,” “aim,” “would,” “annualized” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management’s beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nA number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including those factors discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the following: \n\n•the impact of current and future economic and market conditions generally (including seasonality) and in the financial services industry, nationally and within our primary market areas, including the effects of inflationary pressures, changes in interest rates (including the impact of prolonged elevated interest rates on our financial projections and models), slowdowns in economic growth, and the potential for high unemployment rates, as well as the financial stress on borrowers and changes to customer and client behavior (including the velocity of loan repayment) and credit risk as a result of the foregoing\n\n•changes in interest rate environment (including changes to the federal funds rate, the level and composition of deposits (as well as the cost of, and competition for, deposits), loan demand, liquidity and the values of loan collateral, securities and market fluctuations, and interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities), and competition in our markets may result in increased funding costs or reduced earning assets yields, thus reducing our margins and net interest income;\n\n•our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements, including our ability to generate liquidity internally or raise capital on favorable terms, including continued access to the debt and equity capital markets;\n\n•the risk that a future economic downturn and contraction, including a recession, could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, credit quality, results of operations and future growth, including the risk that the strength of the current economic environment could be weakened by the impact of prolonged elevated interest rates and inflation; \n\n•factors that can impact the performance of our loan portfolio, including real estate values and liquidity in our primary market areas, the financial health and credit quality of our borrowers and the success of various projects that we finance;\n\n•concentration of our loan portfolio in real estate loans and changes in the prices, values and sales volumes of commercial and residential real estate;\n\n•weakness in the real estate market, which can affect, among other things, the value of collateral securing mortgage loans, mortgage loan originations and delinquencies, and mortgage fee income;\n\n43\n\n•credit and lending risks associated with our construction and development, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and residential real estate loan portfolios;\n\n•factors that negatively impact our mortgage banking services, including declines in our mortgage originations or profitability due to rising or elevated interest rates and increased competition and regulation, the Bank’s or third party’s failure to satisfy mortgage servicing obligations, loan modifications, the effects of judicial or regulatory requirements or guidance, and the possibility of the Bank being required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers;\n\n•our ability to attract sufficient loans that meet prudent credit standards, including in our construction and development, commercial and industrial and owner-occupied commercial real estate loan categories;\n\n•our ability to attract and maintain business banking relationships with well-qualified businesses, real estate developers and investors with proven track records in our market areas;\n\n•our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and the sufficiency of our allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\");\n\n•the adequacy of our reserves (including ACL) and the appropriateness of our methodology for calculating such reserves;\n\n•adverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures and the impact of such developments on customer confidence, liquidity and regulatory responses to these developments (including increases in the cost of our deposit insurance assessments and increased regulatory scrutiny), our ability to effectively manage our liquidity risk and any growth plans and the availability of capital and funding;\n\n•our ability to successfully execute our business strategy to achieve profitable growth;\n\n•the concentration of our business within our geographic areas of operation in Georgia, Alabama, Florida and neighboring markets;\n\n•our focus on small and mid-sized businesses;\n\n•our ability to manage our growth;\n\n•our ability to increase our operating efficiency;\n\n•significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets and the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment securities;\n\n•risks that our cost of funding could increase, in the event we are unable to continue to attract stable, low-cost deposits and reduce our cost of deposits;\n\n•inability of our risk management framework to effectively mitigate credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, compliance risk, operational risk (including by virtue of our relationships with third party business partners, as well as our relationships with third party vendors and other service providers), strategic risk, reputational risk and other risks inherent to the business of banking;\n\n•our ability to maintain expenses in line with current projections; \n\n•the makeup of our asset mix and investments;\n\n•external economic, political and/or market factors, such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws (including as a result of the United States presidential election and, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve), the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations, inflation or deflation, changes in the demand for loans, and fluctuations in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition;\n\n•continued or increasing competition from other financial institutions (including fintech companies), credit unions, and non-bank financial services companies, many of which are subject to different regulations than we are;\n\n44\n\n•challenges arising from unsuccessful attempts to expand into new geographic markets, products, or services;\n\n•restraints on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us, which could limit our liquidity;\n\n•increased capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, which may require us to raise capital at a time when capital is not available on favorable terms or at all;\n\n•a failure in the internal controls we have implemented to address the risks inherent to the business of banking;\n\n•inaccuracies in our assumptions about future events, which could result in material differences between our financial projections and actual financial performance;\n\n•changes in our management personnel or our inability to retain, motivate and hire qualified management personnel;\n\n•the dependence of our operating model on our ability to attract and retain experienced and talented bankers in each of our markets, which may be impacted as a result of labor shortages;\n\n•our ability to prevent, identify and address cyber-security risks (which may be exacerbated by the development of generative artificial intelligence), fraud and systems errors;\n\n•disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems, and the cost of defending against them and any reputational or other financial risks following such a cybersecurity incident;\n\n•our business relationships with, and reliance upon, third parties that have strategic partnerships with us or that provide key components of our business infrastructure, including the costs of services and products provided to us by third parties, and disruptions in service, security breaches, financial difficulties with or other adverse events affecting a third-party vendor or business relationship;\n\n•an inability to keep pace with the rate of technological advances due to a lack of resources to invest in new technologies;\n\n•fraudulent and negligent acts by our clients, employees or vendors and our ability to identify and address such acts;\n\n•risks related to potential acquisitions, including the risk that the regulatory environment may not be conducive to or may prohibit the consummation of future mergers and/or business combinations, may increase the length of time and amount of resources required to consummate such transactions, and may reduce the anticipated benefit;\n\n•the impact of any claims or legal actions to which we may be subject, including any effect on our reputation;\n\n•compliance with governmental and regulatory requirements, including the Dodd-Frank Act and others relating to banking, consumer protection, securities and tax matters, and our ability to maintain licenses required in connection with commercial mortgage origination, sale and servicing operations;\n\n•changes in the scope and cost of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance and other coverage;\n\n•changes in our accounting standards;\n\n•changes in tariffs and trade barriers;\n\n•changes in federal tax law or policy; \n\n•the institution and outcome of litigation and other legal proceedings against us or to which we may become subject to;\n\n•the impact of recent and future legislative and regulatory changes;\n\n•examinations by our regulatory authorities;\n\n45\n\n•the effects of war or other conflicts (including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine or the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas), acts of terrorism, acts of God, natural disasters, health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics, climate changes, or other catastrophic events that may affect general economic conditions;\n\n•risks related to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") strategies and initiatives, the scope and pace of which could alter the Company's reputation and shareholder, associate, customer and third-party affiliations;\n\n•a deterioration of the credit rating for U.S. long-term sovereign debt, actions that the U.S. government may take to avoid exceeding the debt ceiling, and uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling and the federal budget; and\n\n•other risks and factors identified in our 2023 Form 10-K, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, and in any of the Company's other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov.\n\nThe foregoing factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read together with the other cautionary statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Because of these risks and other uncertainties, our actual future results, performance or achievement, or industry results, may be materially different from the results indicated by the forward looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future results.

This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements, notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had total consolidated assets of $3.1 billion, total loans, net of $1.9 billion, total deposits of $2.5 billion, and stockholders’ equity of $276.1 million. The Company reported net income of $5.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $16.4 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2024 compared to net income of $5.8 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and $16.1 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily a result of the increase in interest expense that more than offset the increase in interest income due to higher interest rates period over period. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of increased net interest income as detailed above along with increases in noninterest income from service charges on deposits, gains on sales of SBA loans and increases in our complementary lines of business which include mortgage, small business specialty lending, marine/RV lending, insurance and wealth and merchant services.\n\nNet interest income on a tax equivalent basis was $18.7 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $19.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, a decrease of $1.1 million. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $56.1 million, compared to $59.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of $3.9 million. Increases can be seen in income on interest earning assets which is more than offset by increases in expenses on interest bearing liabilities due to the significant rise in interest rates period over period. Income on interest earning assets increased $2.0 million to $34.8 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Expense on interest bearing liabilities increased $3.1 million to $16.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Income on interest earning assets increased $9.5 million to $101.8 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023. Expense on interest bearing liabilities increased $13.3 million to $45.6 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the respective period in 2023.\n\nProvision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $750,000 and $2.4 million, which represents $996,000 and $2.8 million in provision for credit losses on loans and $246,000 and $362,000 in release of credit losses on unfunded commitments, respectively. This is compared to $1.0 million and $2.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represents $1.0 million and $2.2 million in provision for credit losses on loans and $0 and $91,000 in release of credit losses on unfunded commitments, respectively. For the third quarter of 2024, there were \n\n46\n\nnet charge-offs of $139,000 compared to $698,000 for the same period in 2023. Net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2024 were $1.5 million compared to $898,000 for the same period in 2023. Colony’s allowance for credit losses on loans was $19.7 million, or 1.04% of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to $18.4 million, or 0.98% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonperforming assets were $12.5 million and $10.7 million, or 0.41% and 0.35% of total assets, respectively. \n\nNoninterest income of $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 represents an increase of $364,000, or 3.75%, from the third quarter of 2023. Noninterest income of $29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents an increase of $2.7 million, or 10.40%, compared to the same period of 2023. These increases were primarily related to increases in service charges on deposits, gain on sales of SBA loans and BOLI income which were partially offset by decreases in interchange fee income and losses on sales of securities. See \"Table 3 - Noninterest income\" for more detail and discussion on the primary drivers to the variances in noninterest income.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was $20.8 million, a decrease of $46,000, or 0.22%, from the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was $61.6 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 3.02%, from the same period in 2023. Decreases in noninterest expense were a result of decreases in occupancy and equipment expenses, communications expenses and deposit related expenses which were partially offset by an increase in advertising and public relation expenses. See \"Table 4 - Noninterest expense\" for more detail and discussion on the primary drivers to the decrease in noninterest expense.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nOur accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. We have identified certain of its accounting policies as “critical accounting policies,” consisting of those related to business combinations, allowance for credit losses and income taxes. In determining which accounting policies are critical in nature, we have identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates. It is management's practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the Board of Directors' Audit Committee on a periodic basis, including the development, selection, implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies. The application of these policies has a significant impact on the Company’s unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Our financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies. All accounting policies described in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. Other than our methodology for estimating allowance for credit losses (mentioned below), there have been no significant changes to the Significant Accounting Policies as described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\nA consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses. The amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrower.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) and the allowance for unfunded commitments. The standard replaced the “incurred loss” approach, which was used prior to our adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2023, with an “expected loss” approach known as the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”). The CECL approach requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). It removes the incurred loss approach’s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was “probable” a loss event was “incurred.”\n\nThe estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions that are reasonable and supportable. The allowance for unfunded commitments represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit. This allowance is estimated by loan segment at each balance sheet date under the CECL model using the same methodologies as portfolio loans, taking into consideration the likelihood that funding will occur.\n\n47\n\nManagement’s evaluation of the appropriateness of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the credit risk rating we assign to individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, reliance on historical loss rates on homogenous portfolios, consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors, and the reliance on our reasonable and supportable forecasts. The reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower, and industry), local/regional economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, changes in collateral values, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies, and the volume and terms of loans.\n\nRecent Industry Developments\n\nDuring 2023, the banking industry experienced significant volatility with multiple high-profile bank failures which led to industry wide concerns related to liquidity, deposit outflows, uninsured deposit concentrations, unrealized securities losses and eroding consumer confidence in the banking system, which has begun to soften in 2024. These negative industry developments did not impact the Company’s liquidity position and our balance sheet remains robust. The Company’s total deposits did experience a minimal decline of 0.78% as compared to December 31, 2023, to $2.52 billion at September 30, 2024 which was due to wholesale deposit payoffs. The Company’s uninsured deposits represented 31.64% of total Bank deposits at September 30, 2024 compared to 30.22% of total Bank deposits at December 31, 2023. The Company continues to maintain strong liquidity with available sources of funding of approximately $1.3 billion at September 30, 2024. Furthermore, the Company’s capital remains strong with common equity Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 12.51% and 16.48%, respectively, as of September 30, 2024.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nWe reported net income and diluted earnings per share of $5.6 million and $0.32, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024. This compares to net income and diluted earnings per share of $5.8 million and $0.33, respectively, for the same period in 2023. We reported net income and diluted earnings per share of $16.4 million and $0.94, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024. This compares to net income and diluted earnings per share of $16.1 million and $0.92, respectively, for the same period in 2023.\n\n48\n\nNet Interest Income\n\nNet interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds, is the single largest component of total revenue. Management strives to optimize this income while balancing interest rate, credit and liquidity risks.\n\nThe banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest income: net interest spread and net interest margin. The net interest spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The interest rate spread eliminates the effect of noninterest-bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements. The net interest margin is an indication of the profitability of a company's balance sheet and is defined as net interest income as a percent of average total interest-earning assets, which includes the positive effect of funding a portion of interest-earning assets with noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity. \n\nFully taxable equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was $18.7 million and $19.8 million, respectively. This decrease quarter over quarter can be seen in increases in rates paid on deposits and other borrowings which outpaced the increases in rates and volume on loans and deposits in banks. The net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 was 2.64% and 2.78%, respectively. This decrease in net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily a result of the increase in higher yields paid on deposits that outpaced the increase in rates on loans and deposits in banks. Fully taxable equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $56.1 million and $59.9 million, respectively. This decrease quarter over quarter can be seen in increases in rates paid on deposits and other borrowings which outpaced the increases in rates and volume on loans and deposits in banks. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was 2.67% and 2.87%, respectively. This decrease in net interest margin is primarily a result of the increase in higher yields paid on deposits that outpaced the increase in rates on loans and deposits in banks. While we had anticipated margin expansion in the second half of the year, we did not see it materialize in the third quarter of 2024. However, we believe that the margin has now reached its lowest point and we are optimistic about seeing improvement going forward as changes in the rate environment and easing from the Federal Reserve will allow us to relieve pressure on our funding costs.\n\nThe following tables indicates the relationship between interest income and interest expense and the average amounts of assets and liabilities for the periods indicated. As shown in the tables, average assets decreased and average liabilities increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in average assets was primarily driven by the decrease in investment securities of $52.5 million, which was partially offset by an increase in deposits in banks of $10.3 million and the loan portfolio of $32.6 million. The increase in average liabilities was primarily attributed to an increase in borrowings of $25.2 million as well as an increase in interest bearing deposits of $8.3 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, both average assets and average liabilities increased compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in average assets was primarily driven by the increase in the loan portfolio and deposits in banks of $71.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities of $59.3 million. The increase in average liabilities was funded through an increase in interest bearing deposits of $52.6 million along with a slight increase in borrowings of $1.8 million. The net interest spread, as well as the net interest margin, will continue to be impacted by future changes in short-term and long-term interest rate levels, as well as the impact from the competitive environment.\n\nThe yield on total interest-bearing liabilities increased from 2.26% in the third quarter of 2023 to 2.76% in the third quarter of 2024. The yield on total interest-bearing liabilities increased from 1.94% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to 2.66% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were primarily due to increases in the federal funds interest rate of an additional 100 basis points during the first nine months of 2023.\n\n49\n\nTable 1 - Average Balance Sheet and Net Interest Analysis  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30,  \n2024| 2023  \n(dollars in thousands)| AverageBalances| Income/Expense| Yields/Rates| AverageBalances| Income/Expense| Yields/Rates  \nAssets  \nInterest-earning assets:  \nLoans, net of unearned income(1)| $| 1,916,375 | $| 28,560 | 5.93 | %| $| 1,883,811 | $| 26,075 | 5.49 | %  \nInvestment securities, taxable| 719,669 | 4,852 | 2.68 | 761,540 | 5,288 | 2.75   \nInvestment securities, tax-exempt(2)| 95,464 | 501 | 2.09 | 106,136 | 610 | 2.28   \nDeposits in banks and short term investments| 88,563 | 855 | 3.84 | 78,295 | 787 | 3.99   \nTotal interest-earning assets| $| 2,820,071 | $| 34,768 | 4.90 | %| $| 2,829,782 | $| 32,760 | 4.59 | %  \nNoninterest-earning assets| 218,876 | 228,703   \nTotal assets| $| 3,038,947 | $| 3,058,485   \nLiabilities and stockholders' equity  \nInterest-bearing liabilities:  \nInterest-earning demand and savings| $| 1,460,011 | $| 7,342 | 2.00 | %| $| 1,382,638 | $| 4,455 | 1.28 | %  \nOther time| 603,391 | 5,812 | 3.83 | 672,442 | 5,883 | 3.47   \nTotal interest-bearing deposits| 2,063,402 | 13,154 | 2.54 | 2,055,080 | 10,338 | 2.00   \nFederal funds purchased| 2 | — | 5.92 | 764 | 11 | 5.93   \nFederal Home Loan Bank advances| 185,000 | 1,913 | 4.11 | 155,652 | 1,569 | 4.00   \nOther borrowings| 63,001 | 996 | 6.29 | 66,342 | 1,041 | 6.22   \nTotal other interest-bearing liabilities| 248,003 | 2,909 | 4.67 | 222,758 | 2,621 | 4.67   \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities| $| 2,311,405 | $| 16,063 | 2.76 | %| $| 2,277,838 | $| 12,959 | 2.26 | %  \nNoninterest-bearing liabilities:  \nDemand deposits| 440,699 | 509,946   \nOther liabilities| 18,074 | 31,130   \nStockholders' equity| 268,769 | 239,571   \nTotal noninterest-bearing liabilities and stockholders' equity| 727,542 | 780,647   \nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity| $| 3,038,947 | $| 3,058,485   \nInterest rate spread| 2.14 | %| 2.33 | %  \nNet interest income| $| 18,705 | $| 19,801   \nNet interest margin| 2.64 | %| 2.78 | %  \n  \n1.The average balance of loans includes the average balance of nonaccrual loans.

See the section captioned “Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses” elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for credit losses.\n\n52\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nThe following table represents the major components of noninterest income for the periods indicated.Table 3 - Noninterest Income  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30,| Change| Nine Months Ended September 30,| Change  \n(dollars in thousands)| 2024| 2023| Amount| Percent| 2024| 2023| Amount| Percent  \nService charges on deposits| $| 2,401 | $| 2,200 | $| 201 | 9.1 | %| $| 7,062 | $| 6,140 | $| 922 | 15.0 | %  \nMortgage fee income| 1,812 | 1,730 | 82 | 4.7 | 4,503 | 4,928 | (425)| (8.6)  \nGain on sales of SBA loans| 2,227 | 1,268 | 959 | 75.6 | 6,620 | 3,429 | 3,191 | 93.1   \nLoss on sales of securities| (454)| — | (454)| (100.0)| (1,434)| — | (1,434)| (100.0)  \nInterchange fees| 2,163 | 2,202 | (39)| (1.8)| 6,269 | 6,401 | (132)| (2.1)  \nBOLI income| 383 | 335 | 48 | 14.3 | 1,314 | 1,024 | 290 | 28.3   \nInsurance commissions| 433 | 509 | (76)| (14.9)| 1,318 | 1,421 | (103)| (7.2)  \nOther noninterest income| 1,117 | 1,474 | (357)| (24.2)| 3,414 | 2,986 | 428 | 14.3   \nTotal noninterest income| $| 10,082 | $| 9,718 | $| 364 | 3.7 | %| $| 29,066 | $| 26,329 | $| 2,737 | 10.4 | %  \n  \nNoninterest income increased for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases in both periods is a result of increases in service charges on deposits, gain on sales of SBA loans and BOLI income which were partially offset by decreases in interchange fee income and losses on sales of securities. \n\nService charges on deposits. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, service charges on deposits experienced increases compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases in service charges on deposits can be attributed to the Company's ability to maintain a strong deposit base despite the challenging rate environment. \n\nMortgage Fee Income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, mortgage fee income increased and decreased, respectively, as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The three month increase in mortgage fee income was the result of improved mortgage production during the third quarter of 2024. The nine month decrease in mortgage fee income was the result of decreases in mortgage production which can be partially attributed to the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged until the end of the third quarter of 2024. \n\nGain on sales of SBA loans. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, net realized gains on the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans increased as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases are related to increased production and sales in the Small Business Specialty Lending division which hit its highest mark in five consecutive quarters during the first quarter of 2024 and continues to perform at a high level.\n\nBOLI income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, BOLI income was higher when compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases are primarily related to income from the payout of death benefits during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nInterchange fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interchange fee income was slightly lower than the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These minimal decreases in interchange fees are the result of customer use of our card programs whose buying habits can fluctuate between periods.\n\nInsurance commissions. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, insurance commissions decreased slightly compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These variances are volume driven by activity in the Company's insurance division.\n\nOther noninterest income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, other noninterest income decreased and increased, respectively, as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023.  The decrease in other noninterest income for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decline in commissions received from our partnership with Innovation Refunds related to the Employee Retention Credit as well as recording a loss on the sale of assets in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a gain on the sale of assets in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in other noninterest income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to increases in wealth advisory and merchant services, gains on sales of other real estate along with increases in SBA servicing and other related fee income, partially offset by a writedown of Bank premises in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n53\n\nNoninterest Expense\n\nThe following table represents the major components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated.\n\nTable 4 - Noninterest Expense  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30,| Change| Nine Months Ended September 30,| Change  \n(dollars in thousands)| 2024| 2023| Amount| Percent| 2024| 2023| Amount| Percent  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 12,594 | $| 11,973 | $| 621 | 5.2 | %| $| 36,889 | $| 37,929 | $| (1,040)| (2.7)| %  \nOccupancy and equipment| 1,523 | 1,620 | (97)| (6.0)| 4,505 | 4,740 | (235)| (5.0)  \nInformation technology expenses| 2,150 | 2,064 | 86 | 4.2 | 6,487 | 6,406 | 81 | 1.3   \nProfessional fees| 748 | 752 | (4)| (0.5)| 2,286 | 2,348 | (62)| (2.6)  \nAdvertising and public relations| 965 | 766 | 199 | 26.0 | 2,892 | 2,432 | 460 | 18.9   \nCommunications| 210 | 224 | (14)| (6.3)| 652 | 710 | (58)| (8.2)  \nOther noninterest expense| 2,645 | 3,482 | (837)| (24.0)| 7,851 | 8,913 | (1,062)| (11.9)  \nTotal noninterest expense| $| 20,835 | $| 20,881 | $| (46)| (0.2)| %| $| 61,562 | $| 63,478 | $| (1,916)| (3.0)| %  \n  \nNoninterest expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits. Salaries and employee benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased and decreased, respectively, as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses for the three month comparison is a result of an increase in FAS91-deferred costs due to accelerated marine/RV lending costs and the increase in Upstart costs. The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expenses for the nine month comparison is related to the Company's expense reduction initiative in 2023 which lowered total number of employees period over period. \n\nInformation technology expenses. Information technology expenses increased slightly for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These increases relate primarily to an increase in software expenses.\n\nProfessional fees. Professional fees decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These decreases are the result of decreased legal fees partially offset by increased audit and consulting fees.\n\nAdvertising and public relations. Advertising and public relations expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the three month period comparison is related to increased marketing and advertising expenses. The increase for the nine month period comparison can be attributed to a donation in the second quarter of 2024 to Colony Museum, an organization in Fitzgerald, Georgia that Colony Bank helped to establish along with increased marketing and advertising expenses.. \n\nCommunications. Communications expenses decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The changes in each period are related to fluctuations in data circuit fees and postage and freight charges. \n\nOther noninterest expense. Other noninterest expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods ended September 30, 2023. These decreases relate primarily to decreases in deposit related costs, amortization of intangibles and printing and supplies expenses which are partially offset by increased loan related costs. \n\nIncome Tax Expense\n\nIncome tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively, compared to $1.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2023. The Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.0% and 20.6%, respectively, compared to 22.2% and 19.7%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The largest driver of the difference is the tax-exempt \n\n54\n\nincome primarily from BOLI and tax exempt interest. Also, in both the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, the Company experienced a favorable tax impact from the donation made to the Georgia Scholarship Program.\n\nBalance Sheet Review\n\nTotal assets remained constant at $3.1 billion for both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nLoans and Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nAt September 30, 2024, gross loans outstanding (excluding loans held for sale) were $1.89 billion, an increase of $2.6 million, or 0.14%, compared to $1.88 billion at December 31, 2023. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, approximately 64.1% of our loans were secured by commercial real estate. Our total commercial real estate loans have decreased slightly since December 31, 2023 as well as our residential real estate and commercial, financial & agricultural loans while increases can be seen in consumer lending which is driven by our marine and RV division. These movements are largely due to the sale of portfolio mortgages and credit related payoffs of a limited number of loans, along with the general slowdown in loan production over the past several quarters. We continue to maintain competitive loan pricing and tightened credit standards. \n\nThe following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.Table 5 - Loans Outstanding  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 196,390 | $| 247,146   \nOther commercial real estate| 1,012,466 | 974,375   \nTotal commercial real estate| 1,208,856 | 1,221,521   \nResidential real estate| 349,777 | 356,234   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural | 242,389 | 242,756   \nConsumer and other| 85,015 | 62,959   \nTotal loans| $| 1,886,037 | $| 1,883,470   \n  \nThe Company's risk mitigation processes include an independent loan review designed to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio and to ensure credit grade accuracy. The analysis serves as a tool to assist management in assessing the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Loans classified as \"substandard\" are loans which are inadequately protected by the current credit worthiness and paying capacity of the borrower and/or the collateral pledged. These assets exhibit well-defined weaknesses or are showing signs there is a distinct possibility the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. These weaknesses may be characterized by past due performance, operating losses and/or questionable collateral values. Loans classified as \"doubtful\" are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but have an increased risk of loss. Loans classified as \"loss\" are those loans which are considered uncollectible and are in the process of being charged off.\n\nThe Company regularly monitors the composition of the loan portfolio as part of its evaluation over the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company focuses on the following loan categories: (1) construction, land & land development; (2) other commercial real estate; (3) residential real estate; (4) commercial, financial & agricultural; and (5) consumer and other.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses for loans is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses for loans is based on management’s evaluation of the size and composition of the loan portfolio, the level of nonperforming and past due loans, historical trends of charged off loans and recoveries, prevailing economic conditions and other factors management deems appropriate. The Company’s management has established an allowance for credit losses for loans which it believes is adequate to cover expected credit losses over the expected life of a loan exposure and unfunded commitments where the likelihood is that funding will occur. Based on a credit evaluation of the loan portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses for loans and allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments to the Company’s Board of Directors, which primarily focuses on risk by evaluating individual loans in certain risk categories. These categories have also been established by management and take the form of loan grades. By grading the loan portfolio in this manner, the Company’s management is able to effectively evaluate the \n\n55\n\nportfolio by risk, which management believes is the most effective way to analyze the loan portfolio and thus analyze the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans is established by examining (1) the large classified loans, nonaccrual loans and loans considered impaired and evaluating them individually to determine the specific reserve allocation and (2) the remainder of the loan portfolio to allocate a portion of the allowance based on past loss experience and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions for the particular loan category. The Company also considers other factors such as changes in lending policies and procedures; changes in national, regional and/or local economic and business conditions; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; changes in the experience, ability and depth of either the market president or lending staff; changes in the volume and severity of past due and classified loans; changes in the quality of the loan review system; and other factors management deems appropriate.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life. The ACL is calculated using the same aggregate reserve rates calculated for the funded portion of loans at the portfolio level applied to the amount of commitments expected to fund.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans was $19.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $17.4 million at September 30, 2023, an increase of $2.3 million, or 13.2%. The allowance for credit losses on loans as a percentage of loans was 1.04% and 0.93% at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses was $750,000 compared to $1,000,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 includes $996,000 in credit losses on loans and a release of $246,000 in credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 includes $1.0 million in credit losses on loans and a release of $0 in credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses was $2.4 million compared to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes $2.8 million in credit losses on loans and a release of $362,000 in credit losses on unfunded commitments. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 includes $2.2 million in credit losses on loans and a release of $91,000 in credit losses on unfunded commitments. The amount of provision expense recorded in each period was the amount required such that the total allowance for credit losses reflected the appropriate balance, in the estimation of management, that was sufficient to cover expected credit losses on loans over the expected life of a loan exposure and unfunded commitments where the likelihood is that funding will occur. \n\nAdditional information about the Company’s allowance for credit losses is provided in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n\nThe following table presents an analysis of the allowance for credit losses on loans as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\nTable 6 - Analysis of Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n(dollars in thousands)| Reserve| %*| Reserve| %*  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| 1,294 | 10.4 | %| $| 2,215 | 13.2 | %  \nOther commercial real estate| 7,046 | 53.7 | %| 8,720 | 52.0 | %  \nResidential real estate| 6,095 | 18.5 | %| 2,773 | 18.2 | %  \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 2,891 | 12.9 | %| 3,020 | 13.5 | %  \nConsumer and other| 2,337 | 4.5 | %| 640 | 3.1 | %  \n$| 19,663 | 100 | %| $| 17,368 | 100 | %  \n  \n*Percentage represents the loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total end of period loans.\n\n56\n\nThe following table presents a summary of allowance for credit loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\nTable 7 - Summary of Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans  \n---  \nThree Months Ended| Nine Months Ended  \n(dollars in thousands)| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023| September 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans - beginning balance| $| 18,806 | $| 17,066 | $| 18,371 | $| 16,128   \nAdoption of ASU 2016-13| — | — | — | (53)  \nCharge-offs:  \nConstruction, land & land development| — | — | — | —   \nOther commercial real estate| — | — | 20 | —   \nResidential real estate| 9 | — | 349 | —   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 85 | 714 | 1,099 | 1,157   \nConsumer and other| 215 | 14 | 466 | 17   \nTotal charge-offs| 309 | 728 | 1,934 | 1,174   \nRecoveries:  \nConstruction, land & land development| 13 | 1 | 15 | 9   \nOther commercial real estate| 25 | 8 | 43 | 33   \nResidential real estate| 45 | 3 | 252 | 40   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 76 | 13 | 135 | 180   \nConsumer and other| 11 | 5 | 19 | 14   \nTotal recoveries| 170 | 30 | 464 | 276   \nNet charge-offs| 139 | 698 | 1,470 | 898   \nProvision for credit losses on loans| 996 | 1,000 | 2,762 | 2,191   \nAllowance for credit losses on loans- ending balance| $| 19,663 | $| 17,368 | $| 19,663 | $| 17,368   \nNet charge-offs to average loans (annualized)| 0.03 | %| 0.15 | %| 0.10 | %| 0.07 | %  \nAllowance for credit losses on loans to total loans| 1.04 | 0.93 | 1.04 | 0.93   \nAllowance to nonperforming loans| 160.40 | 187.44 | 160.40 | 187.44   \n  \nManagement believes the allowance for credit losses for loans is adequate to provide for losses expected in the loan portfolio as of September 30, 2024.\n\n57\n\nNonperforming Assets\n\nAsset quality experienced a slight decline during the first nine months of 2024. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, accruing loans contractually past due 90 days or more, repossessed personal property and other real estate owned (\"OREO\"). Nonaccrual loans totaled $12.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.4 million, or 24.1%, from $9.8 million at December 31, 2023. There was one loan contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaling $44,000 at September 30, 2024 and one loan totaling $370,000 at December 31, 2023. There was $9,000 in repossessed personal property at September 30, 2024 and none at September 30, 2023. OREO totaled $227,000 at September 30, 2024 compared to $448,000 at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, total nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets increased to 0.41% compared with 0.35% at December 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets was primarily the result of one commercial, financial & agriculture loan of $1.1 million and one other commercial real estate relationship of $2.0 million along with several SBSL government guaranteed loans in various call codes partially offset by repayments, payoffs and charged off loans. \n\nGenerally, loans are placed on non-accrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory requirements. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for non-accrual status whether or not the loan is 90 days or more past due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent loan payments made on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal, and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.\n\nForeclosed property is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. If the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, at the time of foreclosure is less than the loan balance, the deficiency is charged against the allowance for credit losses on loans. If the lesser of the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, or the listed selling price, less the costs to sell, of the foreclosed property decreases during the holding period, a valuation allowance is established with a charge to foreclosed property expense. When the foreclosed property is sold, a gain or loss is recognized on the sale for the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property.\n\nNonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:Table 8 - Nonperforming Assets  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \nNonaccrual loans| $| 12,215 | $| 9,839   \nLoans past due 90 days and accruing| 44 | 370   \nOther real estate owned| 227 | 448   \nRepossessed assets| 9 | —   \nTotal nonperforming assets| $| 12,495 | $| 10,657   \nNonaccrual loans by loan segment  \nConstruction, land & land development| $| — | $| 85   \nCommercial real estate| 5,380 | 4,219   \nResidential real estate| 1,486 | 3,561   \nCommercial, financial & agricultural| 5,327 | 1,956   \nConsumer & other| 22 | 18   \nTotal nonaccrual loans| $| 12,215 | $| 9,839   \nNPAs as a percentage of total loans and OREO| 0.66 | %| 0.57 | %  \nNPAs as a percentages of total assets| 0.41 | %| 0.35 | %  \nNonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans| 0.65 | %| 0.52 | %  \n  \nThe Company had ten loans modified due to financial difficulty during the nine month period ended September 30, 2024. See Note 3 - Loans, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on loan modifications.\n\n58\n\nDeposits\n\nDeposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:Table 9 - Deposits  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \nNoninterest-bearing deposits| $| 439,892 | $| 498,992   \nInterest-bearing deposits| 769,123 | 759,299   \nSavings| 684,371 | 660,311   \nTime, $250,000 and over| 198,942 | 167,680   \nOther time| 432,642 | 458,508   \nTotal deposits| $| 2,524,970 | $| 2,544,790   \n  \nTotal deposits decreased $19.8 million to $2.52 billion at September 30, 2024 from $2.54 billion at December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, 17.4% of total deposits were comprised of noninterest-bearing accounts and 82.6% were comprised of interest-bearing deposit accounts, compared to 19.6% and 80.4% as of December 31, 2023, respectively. The overall decrease in our deposits was primarily the result of a decrease in brokered deposits due to the Company's proactive management of our balance sheet position. In addition, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased due to customer cash flow needs along with movement from noninterest-bearing products to interest-bearing products due to interest rates remaining at a higher level longer than had been expected. \n\nWe had $71.0 million and $93.6 million in brokered deposits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We use brokered deposits, subject to certain limitations and requirements, as a source of funding to support our asset growth and augment the deposits generated from our branch network, which are our principal source of funding. Our level of brokered deposits varies from time to time depending on competitive interest rate conditions and other factors, and tends to increase as a percentage of total deposits when the brokered deposits are less costly than issuing internet certificates of deposit or borrowing from the FHLB. \n\nThe Company's estimated uninsured deposits were $809.2 million at September 30, 2024, or 31.64% of total Bank deposits compared to $777.8 million at December 31, 2023, or 30.22% of total Bank deposits. Adjusted uninsured deposit estimate (which excludes deposits collateralized by public funds and internal accounts) were $463.0 million at September 30, 2024, or 18.11% of total Bank deposits compared to $453.1 million at December 31, 2023, or 17.60% of total Bank deposits. Adjusted uninsured deposits represent a small percentage of our overall deposits, which increases the stability of our deposit base and lowers our overall funding risk.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nThe Company is a party to credit related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. The type of collateral held varies, but may include cash or cash equivalents, unimproved or improved real estate, personal property or other acceptable collateral.\n\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, for a table setting forth the financial instruments that were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk and more information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\n59\n\nLiquidity \n\nAn important part of the Bank's liquidity resides in the asset portion of the balance sheet, which provides liquidity primarily through loan interest and principal repayments and the maturities and sales of securities, as well as the ability to use these assets as collateral for borrowings on a secured basis.\n\nThe Bank's main source of liquidity is customer interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit accounts. Liquidity is also available from wholesale funding sources consisting primarily of federal funds purchased, FHLB advances and brokered deposits. These sources of liquidity are generally short-term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet other short-term liquidity needs. \n\nTo plan for contingent sources of funding not satisfied by both local and out-of-market deposit balances, the Company and the Bank have established multiple borrowing sources to augment their funds management. The Company has borrowing capacity through membership of the FHLB program. The Bank has also established overnight borrowing for federal funds purchased through various correspondent banks. There were no outstanding balances of federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \n\nCash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $144.9 million and $83.3 million, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents have increased since year end 2023, primarily due to sales and paydowns of AFS investment securities. Management believes the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the Company’s liquidity needs without any material adverse impact on our operating results. \n\nLiquidity management involves the matching of cash flow requirements of customers and the ability of the Company to manage those requirements. These requirements of customers include, but are not limited to, deposits being withdrawn or providing assurance to borrowers that sufficient funds are available to meet their credit needs. We strive to maintain an adequate liquidity position by managing the balances and maturities of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities so that the balance we have in short-term assets at any given time will adequately cover any reasonably anticipated need for funds. Additionally, we maintain relationships with correspondent banks, which could provide funds on short notice, if needed. We have also invested in FHLB stock for the purpose of establishing credit lines with the FHLB. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $185.0 million and $175.0 million, respectively, of outstanding advances from the FHLB. Based on the values of loans pledged as collateral, we had $564.3 million and $596.2 million of additional borrowing availability with the FHLB at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \n\nOther sources of liquidity include overnight borrowings from the Federal Reserve Discount Window of $118.8 million of which there was no outstanding balance at September 30, 2024. The Company also had unencumbered securities of $435.1 million, $117.1 million in FRB Reserves and $26.3 million in other cash and due from banks as of September 30, 2024. Unencumbered investment securities provide the ability to either be pledged as collateral with borrowing sources or sold and converted to cash. \n\nThe Company is a separate entity from the Bank, and as such it must provide for its own liquidity. The Company is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its common shareholders and payment of interest and principal on any outstanding debt or trust preferred securities. These obligations are met through internal capital resources such as service fees and dividends from the Bank, which are limited by applicable laws and regulations.\n\nCapital Resources\n\nThe Company and the Bank are required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking agencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk arising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken into account by the federal banking agencies in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. \n\nThe table below summarizes the capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank in order to be considered “well-capitalized” from a regulatory perspective, as well as the Company's and the Bank’s capital ratios as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered to be “well-capitalized” as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There have been no conditions or events since \n\n60\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 that management believes would change this classification. Table 10 - Capital Ratio Requirements  \n---  \nMinimum Requirement| Well-capitalized  \nRisk-based ratios:  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital (CET1)| 4.5 | %| 6.5 | %  \nTier 1 capital| 6.0 | 8.0   \nTotal capital| 8.0 | 10.0   \nLeverage ratio| 4.0 | 5.0   \n  \nTable 11 - Capital Ratios  \n---  \nCompany| September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \nCET1 risk-based capital ratio| 12.51 | %| 11.66 | %  \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio| 13.66 | 12.77   \nTotal risk-based capital ratio| 16.48 | 15.47   \nLeverage ratio| 9.51 | 9.17   \nColony Bank  \nCET1 risk-based capital ratio| 13.67 | %| 12.94 | %  \nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio| 13.67 | 12.94   \nTotal risk-based capital ratio| 14.65 | 13.85   \nLeverage ratio| 9.51 | 9.28   \n  \n61\n\nITEM 3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThe Company's primary market risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk, and to a lesser degree, liquidity risk. The Bank operates under an Asset Liability Management Policy which is approved by the Asset/Liability Management Committee, which is a Board committee that meets regularly. The policy outlines limits on interest rate risk in terms of changes in net interest income and changes in the net market values of assets and liabilities over certain changes in interest rate environments. These measurements are made through a simulation model which projects the impact of changes in interest rates on the Bank's assets and liabilities. The policy also outlines responsibility for monitoring interest rate risk and the process for the approval, implementation and monitoring of interest rate risk strategies to achieve the Bank's interest rate risk objectives.\n\nThe following table presents our interest sensitivity position at the dates indicated.Table 12 - Interest Sensitivity  \n---  \nIncrease (Decrease) in Net Interest Income from Base Scenario at  \nSeptember 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \nChanges in rates  \n200 basis point increase| 4.87%| 0.97%  \n100 basis point increase| 2.56| 0.54  \n100 basis point decrease| (2.28)| 2.03  \n200 basis point decrease| (4.96)| 2.24  \n  \nSee Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” of the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K for additional disclosures related to market and interest rate risk. \n\nThere are no material changes during the period covered by this Report to Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” previously disclosed in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K.\n\nITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of the end of the period covered by this report, as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for ensuring that information the Company is required to disclose in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's senior management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n62\n\nPart II – OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, there are various legal proceedings pending against the Company and the Bank. The aggregate liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would not, in the opinion of management, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position.\n\nITEM1A– RISK FACTORS\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in \"Part I - Item IA - Risk Factors” of the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K, which could materially affect its business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or future results. Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or the trading price of our securities.\n\nThere are no material changes during the period covered by this Report to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. \n\nITEM 2 – UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, USE OF PROCEEDS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\n\n(a) There were no unregistered shares of the Company’s common stock sold during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n\n(b) Not applicable.\n\n(c) The table below sets forth information regarding repurchases of our common stock during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)| Total Number of Shares Repurchased| Average Price Paid per Share| Total Number of Shares Repurchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs| Maximum Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nJuly 1, 2024 to July 31, 2024| — | $| — | — | $| —   \nAugust 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024| — | — | — | —   \nSeptember 1, 2024 to September 30, 2024| 35,000 | 15.02 | 35,000 | 10,290   \nTotal| 35,000 | $| 15.02 | 35,000 | $| 10,290   \n  \nITEM 3 – DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\n\nNone.\n\nITEM 4 – MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\n\nNot applicable.\n\n63\n\nITEM 5 – OTHER INFORMATION\n\nPursuant to Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, none of the Company's directors or executive officers adopted, terminated or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nITEM 6 – EXHIBITS3.1| [Articles of Incorporation, As Amended -filed as Exhibit 99.1 to the Registrant’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 0-12436), filed with the Commission on August 4, 2014 and incorporated herein by reference. ](https://content.edgar-online.com/ExternalLink/EDGAR/0001140361-14-030494.html?hash=b2247407ee6237b9fb200ba6069cd81716656c10f3328792673328fb89e7c62c&dest=ex99_1_htm)  \n---|---  \n3.2| [Articles of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation, As Amended, of Colony Bankcorp, Inc](https://content.edgar-online.com/ExternalLink/EDGAR/0000711669-22-000154.html?hash=078791b4eded12551b1bd9a42fadbcc9e13beb70fd81ff3b027b3dcab9922d9a&dest=exhibit32_htm).-filed as Exhibit 3.2 to the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 0-12436), filed with the Commission on August 12, 2022 and incorporated herein by reference.  \n3.3| [Amended and Restated Bylaws -filed as Exhibit 3.1 to the Registrant’s Current Report on Form 8-K (File No. 000-12436), filed with the Commission on September 18, 2020 and incorporated herein by reference.](https://content.edgar-online.com/ExternalLink/EDGAR/0001628280-20-013730.html?hash=32c8f9c5b2a2d8a819ad407c7031bbcbff651caf8f8380b991d482c8e1255b21&dest=colonybankcorp-amended_htm)  \n31.1| [Certificate of Chief Executive Officer Pursuant to Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](#exhibit31110-qxq32024_htm)  \n31.2 | [Certificate of Chief Financial Officer Pursuant to Section 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](#exhibit31210-qxq32024_htm)  \n32.1| [Certification of Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](#exhibit32110-qxq32024_htm)  \n101 | Interactive data files pursuant to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T, formatted in Inline XBRL: (i) Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023; (ii) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; (iii) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; (iv) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; (v) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; and (vi) Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements*  \n104 | The cover page from Colony Bankcorp’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (formatted in Inline XBRL and included in Exhibit 101)  \n  \n64\n\nSIGNATURES\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.Colony Bankcorp, Inc.  \n---  \n/s/ T.

The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, May 16, 2024, at Colony Bankcorp, Inc.’s Corporate Office at 115 South Grant Street, Fitzgerald, Georgia 31750, at 11:00 a.m. local time.\n\nThe approximate date on which this proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are first being sent or mailed to shareholders is April 11, 2024. You should read the entire proxy statement carefully before voting.\n\nAs used in this proxy statement, the terms “Colony Bankcorp,” “Company,” “Colony,” “we,” “our” and “us” all refer to Colony Bankcorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Colony Bank, except where the context requires otherwise.\n\nNotice Regarding The Internet Availability Of Proxy Materials\n\nWe have posted materials related to the 2024 Annual Meeting on the Internet. The following materials are available on the Internet at https://materials.proxyvote.com/19623P:\n\n•This proxy statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting,\n\n•Colony’s 2023 annual report to shareholders, and\n\n•Colony’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n1\n\nVOTING\n\nGeneral\n\nThe securities which can be voted at the Annual Meeting consist of the Company’s common stock, $1.00 par value per share (“Company common stock”), with each share entitling its owner to one vote on each matter submitted to the shareholders. The record date for determining the holders of Company common stock who are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting is March 22, 2024. Holders of shares of our common stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to attend the Annual Meeting and vote on the proposals brought forth during the Annual Meeting or any postponements or adjournments thereof. On the record date, 17,558,611 shares of Company common stock were outstanding and eligible to be voted.\n\nQuorum and Vote Required\n\nThe presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. In determining whether a quorum exists at the Annual Meeting for purposes of all matters to be voted on, all votes “for” or “against” as well as all broker non-votes and abstentions (including votes to withhold authority to vote) will be counted. \n\nIn voting for the proposal to elect eight directors (Proposal No. 1), you may vote in favor of all nominees or withhold your votes as to all or as to specific nominees. The vote required to approve each director nominee set forth in Proposal No. 1 is governed by the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws and is an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting where a quorum is present, provided, however, in the event of a contested election for a director seat, such director shall be elected by a plurality of votes received rather than a majority of votes cast. Abstentions, votes withheld, and broker non-votes will not be counted and will have no effect. Shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting in the election of our directors. Any other matter which may be submitted to shareholders at the Annual Meeting will be determined by a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, excluding abstentions, votes withheld, and broker non-votes, which will not be counted and will have no effect.\n\nIn voting on the proposal to approve the advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 2), you may vote for or against the proposal or abstain. The proposal will be deemed approved if a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting are voted for Proposal No. 2, excluding abstentions, votes withheld, and broker non-votes, which will not be counted and will have no effect. The vote is advisory, and will not be binding upon the directors.\n\nIn voting on the proposal to approve the ratification of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm ( Proposal No. 3), you may vote for or against the proposal or abstain. The proposal will be deemed approved if a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting are voted for Proposal No. 3, excluding abstentions and votes withheld, which will not be counted and will have no effect. \n\nAs of March 22, 2024, our directors and executive officers held 1,156,646 shares of Company common stock, or approximately 6.59% of all outstanding common stock, and we believe that all of those shares will be voted in favor of all proposals. \n\nIn the event there are not sufficient votes for a quorum or to approve or ratify any proposal at the time of the Annual Meeting, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned or postponed to permit the further solicitation of proxies.\n\nThe Board recommends that you vote your shares \"FOR\" the election of each of the eight director nominees named in this proxy statement, \"FOR\" the advisory vote on the compensation of Colony’s named executive officers, and \"FOR\" the ratification of Mauldin & Jenkins, LLC as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2024.\n\nProxies\n\nIf you hold your shares in your own name, you may vote by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting. To vote your shares, you may select one of the following options:\n\n•Vote by Telephone - You can vote your shares by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until 11:59 P.M., Eastern Time, on May 15, 2024. Easy-to-follow voice prompts allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your instructions have been properly \n\n2\n\nrecorded. Our telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate the shareholder by using individual control numbers. If you vote by telephone, you do NOT need to return your proxy card.\n\n•Vote by Internet - You can also choose to vote by visiting www.proxyvote.com. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until 11:59 P.M., Eastern Time, on May 15, 2024. You will be given the opportunity to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote on the Internet, you do NOT need to return your proxy card.\n\n•Vote by Mail - If you choose to vote by mail, simply mark your proxy card, date and sign it and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided.\n\n•Vote in Person - You can vote your shares at the Annual Meeting by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.\n\nAll properly executed proxy cards delivered pursuant to this solicitation and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the directions given. In voting by proxy with regard to the election of directors, you may vote in favor of all nominees, withhold your votes as to all nominees or withhold your votes as to specific nominees. You should specify your choices on the proxy card. If no specific instructions are given with regard to the matters to be voted upon, the shares represented by a signed proxy card will be voted “FOR” the proposals listed on the proxy card. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote upon such matters according to their judgment.\n\nAll expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies will be paid by the Company. Solicitation may take place by mail, telephone, telegram, or personal contact by our directors, officers, and employees of the Company without additional compensation. The Annual Report of the Company for the year 2023, which includes the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, accompanies this proxy statement.\n\nBeneficial Holders: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker, Bank or Other Agent\n\nMany of our shareholders hold their shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or other agent, commonly referred to as “street name,” you should have received our proxy materials from that organization rather than from us. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other agent regarding how to vote your shares. As the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since your bank, broker, or other nominee, and not you, is the shareholder of record, you may not vote shares held in street name in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a signed “legal proxy” from your bank, broker, or other nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. Your bank, broker, or other nominee has enclosed or provided with this proxy statement a voting instruction card for you to use to direct your bank, broker, or other nominee how to vote your shares.\n\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other agent as your nominee, you are considered the “beneficial holder” of the shares held for you in what is known as “street name.” You are not the “record holder” of such shares. If this is the case, you will need to obtain a proxy card from the organization that holds your shares and follow the instructions included on that form regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other agent to vote your shares. Brokers, banks or other agents that have not received voting instructions from their customers cannot vote on their customers’ behalf with respect to proposals that are not “routine” but may vote their customers’ shares with respect to proposals that are “routine.” Shares that brokers, banks and other agents are not authorized to vote are referred to as “broker non-votes.” The ratification of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is a routine proposal, while the election of directors, and the advisory vote on executive compensation are not “routine” proposals. Therefore, if you are a beneficial holder and if you submit a voting instruction form to your bank, broker or other nominee but do not specify how to vote your shares, your shares will be voted in the bank, broker or other nominee’s discretion with respect to the ratification of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm but such shares will not be voted with respect to the election of directors, and the advisory vote on executive compensation.\n\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other agent as your nominee, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other agent as your nominee if you wish to change or revoke your vote.\n\n3\n\nProxies\n\nThe Board has appointed T. Heath Fountain and Mark H. Massee as your proxies, each with power of substitution, at the Annual Meeting. We are not aware of any other matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters come before the Annual Meeting, Mr. Fountain and Mr. Massee will vote your proxy on such matters in accordance with their judgment .\n\nChanging My Vote\n\nAll proxy cards delivered pursuant to this solicitation are revocable at any time before the Annual Meeting by giving written notice to our Secretary, Edward L. Bagwell, at 115 South Grant Street, Fitzgerald, Georgia 31750, by delivering a later dated proxy card, by voting in person at the Annual Meeting, or by voting again by telephone or on the Internet prior to 11:59 P.M., Eastern Time, on May 15, 2024. Please note that attending the Annual Meeting in person will not automatically change or revoke your proxy unless you vote again in person at the Annual Meeting. \n\nIf your shares are held by your broker, bank or other agent as your nominee, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other agent as your nominee if you wish to change or revoke your vote.\n\nVoting Results\n\nThe Company will publish the voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) within four business days following the Annual Meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known to us, file an additional Form 8-K to publish the final results .\n\nAttending the Annual Meeting\n\nIf you attend the Annual Meeting and desire to vote your shares at the meeting, you must bring photo identification. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other agent, you must also bring proof of your ownership of your shares, such as the voting instruction form or an account statement from your broker, bank or other agent. Without proof of ownership, you may not be allowed to vote at the meeting. The use of cameras, sound recording equipment, communications devices or any similar equipment during the Annual Meeting is prohibited without express written consent of the Company. \n\nProxy Solicitation\n\nThe Board of Directors is asking for your proxy, and we will pay all of the costs of soliciting shareholder proxies. In addition to the solicitation of proxies via mail, our officers, directors and employees may solicit proxies personally or by other means of communication, without being paid additional compensation for such services. The Company will reimburse banks, brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses in forwarding the proxy materials to beneficial owners of common stock. \n\nAdditional Questions\n\nShareholders who have questions about the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting or how to submit a proxy, or who desire additional copies of the Proxy should contact Edward L. Bagwell at Colony Bankcorp, Inc., 115 South Grant Street, Fitzgerald, Georgia 31750 or by phone at (229) 426-6000 or by email to lbagwell@colonybank.com.\n\n4\n\nBUSINESS OF THE COMPANY\n\nThe Company is a Georgia business corporation that began operating as Colony Bank in 1975. The Company was organized for the purpose of operating as a bank-holding company in 1982 under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the bank holding company laws of Georgia. From 1984 through 2008, the Company engaged in a series of mergers and acquisitions that resulted in the Company’s ownership of seven banking subsidiaries and one non-bank subsidiary. In 2008, the Company affected a merger (the “Merger”) of its subsidiary banks into one surviving bank, Colony Bank of Fitzgerald, which it renamed Colony Bank (the “Bank”). \n\nThe Company conducts a general full service commercial, consumer and mortgage borrowing business through 36 locations throughout Georgia and is now serving Alabama and North Florida. The Bank also helps its customers achieve their goal of home ownership through Colony Bank Mortgage. In 2021, through a fully owned subsidiary of the Bank, CBAN Customer Synergy, LLC, the Company began offering insurance to its customers. Because the Company is a bank holding company, its principal operations are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Colony Bank. The Company has 100 percent ownership of the Bank and maintains systems of financial, operational and administrative controls that permit centralized evaluation of the operations of the Bank in selected functional areas including operations, accounting, marketing, investment management, purchasing, human resources, computer services, auditing, compliance and credit review.\n\nResponsibility for management of the Bank remains with the Bank’s Board of Directors and officers. Services rendered by the Company are intended to assist bank management and to expand the scope of available banking services.\n\nColony Bankcorp, Inc.’s common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “CBAN.”\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 the Company and its subsidiaries employed 464 employees, 453 of which are full-time employees.\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 1\n\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n\nOur Board of Directors consists of ten members, eight of whom are non-employee directors.

Current board representation by outside directors demonstrates a background in banking, local government, construction and small business ownership, with the expertise of these individuals covering a broad array of skills including corporate management, human resource management, strategic planning, business acquisitions, and small business operations.

There are no arrangements or understandings between any of the executive officers and any other person pursuant to which he or she was selected as an executive officer. No executive officer named herein has a family relationship, as defined in Item 401 of Regulation S-K, with any of the directors or other executive officers.\n\nGovernance of the Company\n\nOverview\n\nOur Board of Directors believes that the purpose of corporate governance is to ensure that shareholder value is maximized in a manner consistent with legal requirements and the highest standards of integrity. The Company, through its Board of Directors and management, has long sought to meet the highest standards of corporate governance. The Board has adopted and adheres to corporate governance guidelines which the Board and senior management believe promotes this purpose, are sound and represent best practices. We continually review these governance practices, Georgia law (the law of the state in which we are incorporated), the rules and listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market, and SEC regulations, as well as best practices suggested by recognized governance authorities.\n\nDirector Independence\n\nThe Board has evaluated the independence of its directors in accordance with the NASDAQ rules and applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Our corporate governance guidelines and principles and the NASDAQ rules require that a majority of the Board be composed of directors who meet the requirements for independence established by these standards. Currently, our Board of Directors has ten members, all of whom meet the NASDAQ standard for independence with the exception of Messrs. Fountain, and Schmitt. The rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, as well as those of the SEC, also impose several other requirements with respect to the independence of our directors. Following the Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors will consist of eight members, of which six members will meet the NASDAQ standard for independence. The Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Fountain and Schmitt each do not qualify as an independent director because they are current or past executive officers of the Company and/or the Bank. The Board has further determined that each director who serves on the Audit Committee, Governance Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee satisfies the independence requirements for such committees in accordance with the NASDAQ rules and applicable rules and regulations of the SEC.\n\n9\n\nDirector Qualifications \n\nOur Company places a strong emphasis on the ethical conduct and values of our directors. It is crucial for them to uphold the highest standards of professionalism and personal integrity, aligning with our longstanding values and principles. To ensure that our directors possess the necessary qualifications, we seek individuals who have extensive experience in policy-making roles within various sectors such as business, government, or civic organizations.\n\nIn addition to their professional background, our directors must be dedicated to enhancing shareholder value. This means that they should prioritize the long-term growth and success of the Company, always considering the best interests of our shareholders. To fulfill their responsibilities effectively, our directors must also have sufficient time available to carry out their duties and contribute valuable insights and practical wisdom based on their own unique experiences.\n\nOne of the key expectations from our directors is that they represent the interests of all shareholders. This means that they should act impartially and make decisions that benefit the entire shareholder base rather than favoring specific individuals or groups. When evaluating potential candidates for director positions, our Board of Directors takes into account various factors. These include the candidate's independence, character, judgment, diversity, age, skills, financial literacy, and relevant experience. By considering these aspects, we aim to ensure that our board is well-rounded and capable of addressing the diverse needs and challenges faced by our Company.\n\nAbove all, our Board of Directors prioritizes the selection of individuals who will actively contribute to the interests of our shareholders. We seek individuals who have a proven track record of professional and personal achievements, as well as expertise that aligns with our growth strategy. By bringing together a diverse group of directors with a wide range of experiences and perspectives, we believe that we can enhance our ability to make informed decisions and drive our Company's success in the long run.\n\nLeadership Structure of the Board\n\nThe Company is committed to strong Board leadership. Our governance framework provides the Board with flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. In making leadership structure determinations, the Board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business and what is in the best interests of the Company’ shareholders. In accordance with the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Board of Directors elects our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman; each of these positions may be held by the same person or may be held by two persons. Currently, Mark H. Massee serves as Chairman of both the Company and the Bank and T. Heath Fountain serves as Chief Executive Officer of both the Company and the Bank. In this capacity as Chairman, Mr. Massee has frequent contact with Mr. Fountain and other members of management on a broad range of matters and has additional corporate governance responsibilities for the Board. The Board of Directors believes that separating the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles fosters clear accountability, effective decision-making, and alignment with corporate strategy and provides an effective leadership model for the Company. In light of the active involvement by all independent directors, the Board of Directors has not specified a lead independent director at this time. After careful consideration, the Board of Directors believes that its current structure is appropriate to effectively manage the affairs of the Company and the best interests of the Company’s shareholders. From time to time, the board leadership structure will be re-evaluated to ensure that it continues to be the most effective approach in serving the Company’s goals. In addition, to further strengthen the oversight of the full board of directors, our independent directors hold executive sessions at which only independent directors are present. The executive sessions are scheduled in connection with regularly scheduled board meetings, which occurs at least four times a year.\n\nExecutive Sessions\n\nIn order to give a significant voice to our non-management directors, we provide for executive sessions of our non-management and independent directors. Our Board believes this is an important governance practice that enables the Board to discuss matters without management present. Our non-management directors are given the opportunity to meet in executive session following each regularly scheduled Board meeting. Our independent directors meet separately from the other directors in regularly scheduled executive sessions at least twice annually, and at such other times as may be deemed appropriate by the Company’s independent directors. Any independent director may call an executive session of independent directors at any time. The independent directors met 9 times in executive session in 2023 .\n\n10\n\nBoard’s Role in Risk Oversight\n\nThe Board of Directors is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect the Company and the Bank. The Board of Directors has ultimate authority and responsibility for overseeing our risk management. The Board of Directors monitors, reviews and reacts to material enterprise risks identified by management. The Board receives specific reports from management on financial, credit, liquidity, interest rate, capital, operational, legal compliance and reputation risks and the degree of exposure to those risks. The Board helps ensure that management is properly focused on risk by, among other things, reviewing and discussing the performance of senior management and business line leaders. This oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board, as disclosed in the descriptions of each of the committees below. However, the full Board has retained responsibility through full reports by each committee chair regarding the committee’s considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within the Company and the Bank.\n\nCybersecurity and Information Security Risk Oversight\n\nOur Board recognizes the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, clients, and employees, and devotes significant time and attention to oversight of cybersecurity and information security risk. In particular, our Board and Risk Management Committee receive regular reporting on cybersecurity and information security risk, as well as presentations throughout the year on cybersecurity and information security topics. Our Risk Management Committee also annually reviews and approves our Information Security Policy. Our Risk Management Committee reviews cybersecurity and information security as well as steps taken by management to understand and mitigate such risks. Our Board received quarterly updates on cybersecurity and information security risk in 2023 and discussed cyber security and information security risks with both the Information Security Officer and Chief Risk Officer. For more information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance, see “Part I - Item 1C. Cybersecurity” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 .\n\nBoard and Committee Self-Evaluation\n\nThe Board and Board committees undertake a joint evaluation process on an annual basis. Each director evaluates the performance of the Board and Management. The evaluations are reviewed by the Governance Committee and the Chairman of the Board, and the aggregated results are shared and discussed by the Board as a whole. The evaluation process improves the overall effectiveness of the Board and Board committees by identifying strengths, as well as areas for which additional training may be needed .\n\nBoard Diversity\n\nThe Company highly values diversity on its Board of Directors. We aim to ensure that the composition of the Board reflects diversity of race, gender, age, geography, education, and work experience. We believe that a diverse board translates to more effective strategic planning, critical decision making, and creative problem solving, all resulting in a better return for our shareholders. We are actively working to increase the diversity of our Board, including the number of women and ethnic minorities on the Board. The following matrix depicts the diversity of the Board as of March 22, 2024.\n\nBoard Training\n\nThe Company provides training and presentations throughout the year to all Directors in many different areas including; BSA, ESG, Insider Trading, Fair Lending, fiduciary responsibility, and others.

Throughout the year, members of our management team meet regularly with a number of our shareholders to discuss our corporate strategy, financial performance, long-term objectives, credit risks, capital management, enterprise risk management, corporate governance, ESG related matters, and executive compensation. In regularly engaging with our shareholders, we provide perspective on our governance policies and executive compensation practices and seek input from these shareholders to ensure that we are addressing their questions and concerns. \n\n•Our on-going shareholder engagement program encompasses a number of initiatives, including: \n\n•Regularly scheduled in-person and virtual meetings with our larger institutional shareholders; \n\n•Responses to institutional and retail shareholder correspondence and inquiries; \n\n•Attendance and participation at approximately 6 industry conferences each year; \n\n•In-person and telephonic meetings with rating agencies including Standard & Poor’s, Fitch, and Moody’s; and\n\n•Regular engagement with sell-side analysts who covers the Company to reinforce key themes related to our business strategy and financial performance.

This allowed us to better understand and address shareholder questions and concerns related to such issues as our financial performance, the interest rate environment, our strategic objectives, and our long-term growth strategy. Feedback and perspectives shared during these engagement meetings were discussed by executive management and the Board and influenced several changes and disclosure enhancements. \n\nWe look forward to continued enhancement of our shareholder engagement program in 2024.

The Company utilizes Industry specific salary surveys as a source to evaluate competitiveness of base salaries. The level of each executive officer’s base salary is designed to reward performance for carrying out the required day-to-day activities and responsibilities of each officer’s position. We increase base salaries based upon competitive market needs, our past and expected financial performance and the individual executive’s performance. Base salary is a large element of the compensation program because it fairly compensates individuals for fulfilling their daily responsibilities and obligations. Our named executive officers did not receive base salary increases for 2024. The Compensation Committee determined the initial 2024 base salary for the named executive officers by reviewing salary surveys from different industry groups, considering the environment of the financial industry and discussing with our legal counsel who is knowledgeable about the banking industry’s compensation for executive officers. \n\nThe base salary approved and in effect for 2024 for each named executive officer is listed on the following chart:\n\nExecutive| 2024 Base Salary  \n---|---  \nT. Heath Fountain| $| 485,000   \nRoy Dallis Copeland, Jr| 365,000   \nLeonard Bateman, Jr| 245,000   \n  \nAnnual Cash Incentive Compensation. Cash incentives for each of the named executive officers are based primarily on performance with regard to goals established by the Compensation Committee. In 2023, measurement was based on using five distinct goals that were weighted based on their relative relationship to overall performance including:\n\n•achieving an operating return on average assets (ROAA) ratio of greater than 0.89% (weighted at 25%); \n\n•achieving an operating earnings per share (EPS) greater than $1.53 per share (weighted at 25%); \n\n•achieving net growth in organic customer deposit growth of greater than $103.129 million (weighted at 20%); \n\n•achieving net operating non-interest expense to average assets (Net NIE) ratio of less than 1.94% (weighted at 20%); and \n\n•achieving individual performance goals (weighted at 10%). \n\nIncentives awarded in 2024 based on 2023 performance will be paid to each named executive as follows: 60% to be paid in cash in 2024 with the remaining balance of the award to be paid in equal installments over the following three years.\n\nEmployment Agreement with Mr. Fountain.The Company is a party to an employment agreement with Mr. Fountain, which has a 3-year term (expiring July 30, 2024) and provides for an initial base salary of $420,000 and participation in any annual discretionary bonus and employee benefit plans available to other similarly-situated Bank employees.

Mr. Fountain’s base salary remained the same year over year, however his annual incentive and equity awards granted decreased by a larger amount from 2022 to 2023, which were offset slightly by an increase in the Company's stock price over that same period. The average NEO CAP decreased year over year and was primarily due to the change in NEOs in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nThe increase in Colony Bankcorp’s stock price that partially offset the decreased PEO CAP also drove the increase in the Company's Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) in 2023 compared to 2022. While the TSR increased over the two-year period, the average NEO CAP saw a decrease for the reasons noted above.\n\nColony Bankcorp’s Net Income increased in 2023 compared to 2022, and had a positive impact on the year over year decrease in the PEO CAP. See discussion above for the direct contributing factors for the PEO CAP decrease. Average NEO CAP decreased for the reasons noted above.\n\n2022 Compared to 2021\n\nCompensation Actually Paid (“CAP”) to Mr. Fountain and cumulative total shareholder return were both lower in 2022 compared to 2021. Mr. Fountain’s base salary increased year over year, however his annual incentive and equity awards granted decreased by a larger amount from 2021 to 2022, primarily due to a decrease in the Company's stock price over that same period. The average NEO CAP increased year over year and was primarily due to the change in NEOs in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nThe decrease in Colony Bankcorp’s stock price that partially contributed to the decreased PEO CAP also drove the decrease in the Company's Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) in 2022 compared to 2021. While the TSR decreased over the two-year period, the average NEO CAP saw an increase for the reasons noted above.\n\nColony Bankcorp’s Net Income increased in 2022 compared to 2021, and had a positive impact on the year over year decrease in the PEO CAP. See discussion above for the direct contributing factors for the PEO CAP decrease. Average NEO CAP increased for the reasons noted above.\n\n27\n\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company uses cash incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board. In setting director compensation, the Company considers the significant amount of time that Directors expend in fulfilling their duties to the Company as well as the skill-level required by the Company of members of the Board.\n\nCash Compensation Paid to Board Members\n\nFor fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, independent members of the Board (except the Chairman) received a retainer of $48,000 for Board Service for the year. Members that are also employees of the Company receive a retainer of $18,000 for board service for the year. The Chairman received a retainer of $63,000 for the year for Board service. Committee Chairs receive an additional $2,000 annually per committee chaired. Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive any committee fees. Most non-employee Directors were awarded 600 shares of Company stock that will vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. As a new Director, Ms. Hollingsworth received 3,000 shares of Company stock that will vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date.\n\n28\n\nSubsidiary Director Compensation\n\nColony Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has deferred compensation plans covering certain former directors and certain officers choosing to participate through individual deferred compensation contracts. In accordance with terms of the contracts, the Bank is committed to pay the directors deferred compensation over a specified number of years, beginning at age 65. In the event of a director’s death before age 65, payments are made to the director’s named beneficiary over a specified number of years, beginning on the first day of the month following the death of the director.\n\n2023 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE\n\nFees Earned or Paid in Cash ($)|  Stock Awards(1)| All Other Compensation| Total  \n---|---|---|---  \nScott L.

The grant date fair value was based on the value of stock on the grant date ($9.43 per share with respect to each other non-employee Director’s grant of 600 shares on July 1, 2023 and Ms. Hollingsworth's grant of 3,000 shares on July 1, 2023). \n\n(2) Mr. Hester passed away on January 22, 2023. \n\nProhibitions on Hedging\n\nThe Company prohibits all directors, officers and employees from engaging in speculative trading and hedging shares of Company securities. This includes prohibitions against short-selling Company securities and transactions in any derivative of Company securities, including buying and writing options. Directors, officers and employees are restricted from buying Company securities on margin. Additionally, the Company’s Insider Trading Policy prohibits trading for directors, officers and certain employees during designated blackout periods and requires approval by the Company’s General Counsel prior to any trade.\n\nClawback Policy\n\nThe Company maintains a clawback policy that complies with the applicable listing standards of NASDAQ and Rule 10D-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In the event of a restatement of the Company’s reported financial results due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, the Compensation Committee will recover reasonably promptly the amount of all erroneously awarded compensation received by an executive officer during the covered period (within the meaning of such terms as provided in the NASDAQ listing standards).\n\n29\n\nRelated Party Transactions with the Company\n\nTransactions by us with related parties are subject to a formal written policy, as well as regulatory requirements and restrictions. These requirements and restrictions include Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W, which governs certain transactions by us with our affiliates, and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation O, which governs certain loans by us to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. We have adopted policies to comply with these regulatory requirements and restrictions.\n\nIn addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy governing the approval of related party transactions that complies with all applicable requirements of the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market concerning related party transactions. Related party transactions are transactions in which we are a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Our related parties include our directors (including nominees for election as directors), executive officers, shareholders beneficially owning 5% or more of our common stock and the immediate family members of these persons. Our Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with counsel, as appropriate, will review potential related party transactions to determine if they are subject to the policy. If so, the transaction will be referred to our Audit Committee for approval. In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, our Audit Committee will consider, among other factors, the fairness of the proposed transaction, the direct or indirect nature of the related party’s interest in the transaction, the appearance of an improper conflict of interests for any director or executive officer taking into account the size of the transaction and the financial position of the related party, whether the transaction would impair an outside director’s independence, the acceptability of the transaction to our regulators and the potential violations of other corporate policies.\n\nLoans. The Company’s directors and officers from time to time have borrowed funds from the Company’s subsidiary for various business and personal reasons. Such loans are made in strict compliance with state and federal statutes and regulations of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance. Such loans were made in the ordinary course of business; were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as were prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lender; and did not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, certain officers, executive officers, directors, and companies in which they are an executive officer or partner or in which they have a 10% or more beneficial interest, were indebted to the Bank in the aggregate amount of $6,590,606.02 outstanding or available. \n\nThe Company adopted a related person transaction policy and procedure on October 17, 2017, and to the best of our knowledge all related parties are in compliance.\n\n30\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nThere are no “material” pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business of the Company, to which the Company or its subsidiary is a party or of which any of their property is subject. Material proceedings are defined as claims for damages where the amount involved, exclusive of interest and cost, exceeds 10 percent of the current assets of the Company and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis.\n\nDuring the previous 10 years, no director, person nominated to become a director, or executive officer of the Company was the subject of a legal proceeding that is material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any such person.\n\nShareholder Communication with the Board of Directors \n\nOur Board of Directors does not have an established written policy or process for security holders to send communications to the Board of Directors. However, it has been the practice of the Company to direct any such communications to the Chairman of the Board, who would, in his or her discretion, discuss the communications with the Board at a regular Board meeting. The Board has determined this practice and process to be satisfactory in allowing security holders to communicate directly with the Board of Directors. Communications that are not related to the duties and responsibilities of the Board of Directors or a committee will not be distributed, including spam, junk mail and mass mailings, surveys and business solicitations or advertisements. In addition, we will not distribute unsuitable material to our directors, including material that is unduly hostile, threatening or illegal.\n\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\n\nDuring 2023, Mr. Dwozan, until his retirement, Ms. Hollingsworth, Mr. Massee, Mr. Reed and Mr. Ross served as members of the Compensation Committee. During 2023, no member of the Compensation Committee served as an officer or employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, was formerly an officer of the Company or its subsidiaries, or entered into any transactions with the Company or its subsidiaries that would require disclosure under applicable SEC regulations. During 2023, none of our executive officers served as a member of the compensation committee or on the board of directors of another entity, any of whose executive officers served on our Compensation Committee or on our Board of Directors.\n\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\n\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company’s officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of the Company stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file .\n\nTo the Company’s knowledge, based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, and written representations from certain reporting persons, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, its officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial shareholders timely complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements except that:\n\n•Matthew D. Reed, Director, filed a late Form 4 on December 6, 2023 to report the purchase of 80 shares on February 23, 2023 and 2 shares on February 27, 2023\n\n•Brian D. Schmitt, Director, filed a late Form 4 on February 10, 2023 to report the withholding of 951 shares for taxes upon vesting of restricted stock on January 1, 2023\n\n•Roy D. Copeland, Jr., President, filed a late Form 4 on February 8, 2023 to report the withholding of 832 shares for taxes upon vesting of restricted stock on January 1, 2023\n\n•Leonard H. Bateman, Chief Credit Officer, filed a late Form 4 on July 19, 2023 to report withholding of 982 shares for taxes upon vesting of restricted stock on July 1, 2023\n\n31\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 2 – NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nSection 14A(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company to permit a non-binding advisory vote (at least once every three years) on the compensation of its Named Executive Officers, as described and presented in the “Executive Compensation” section of this 2024 Proxy Statement, and the accompanying tables and narrative disclosure. \n\nThis proposal, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” proposal, gives the Company’s shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive compensation program and policies through the following resolution:\n\n“Resolved, that the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K located in the ‘Executive Compensation’ section of the 2024 Proxy Statement, and the accompanying executive compensation tables and narrative discussions is hereby APPROVED.”\n\nBecause your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. It is our current policy to provide you this advisory voting opportunity annually. Accordingly, you will have the opportunity to vote on whether to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers again at our 2025 annual meeting of shareholders. \n\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” this proposal.\n\n32\n\nPROPOSAL NO. 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR\n\nOur Audit Committee has selected Mauldin & Jenkins, LLC, to serve as our independent accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, subject to ratification by the shareholders. Representatives of Mauldin & Jenkins, LLC will be available at the Annual Meeting on May 16, 2024, and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will be available to answer your questions at that time.\n\nShareholder ratification of the selection of Mauldin & Jenkins, LLC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2024 fiscal year is not required by our bylaws, state law or otherwise. The Board of Directors is submitting the selection of Mauldin & Jenkins, LLC as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to the shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the ratification of the appointment of Mauldin & Jenkins, LLC is not approved by a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, other independent registered public accounting firms may be considered by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” this proposal.\n\n33\n\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company retained Mauldin and Jenkins, LLC to serve as the Company's principal independent auditor. Services were provided in the following categories and amounts:\n\n2023| 2022  \n---|---  \nAudit Fees (1)| $| 387,235 | $| 353,865   \nAudit-related Fees (2)| 41,850 | 42,500   \nTax Fees| — | —   \nAll other Fees| — | —   \nTotal| $| 429,085 | $| 396,365   \n  \n(1)Includes audit of financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting, reporting to audit committee, review of quarterly financials, attestation of Internal Controls for FDICIA, and review of SEC filings. \n\n(2)Includes assurance and related services, fees related to the HUD audit, fees related to the performance of audits and attest services not required by statute or regulations, due diligence and consents related to mergers, acquisitions, and investments, accounting consultations about the application of generally accepted accounting principles to proposed transactions and fees related to shelf registration and stock offering work through the end of the year.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee approves, in advance, the independent registered public accounting firm, and on a case-by-case basis, all audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee delegates authority over the review of such preapprovals to an internal audit firm, which prepares an internal program that is subject to the Audit Committee’s approval. Such approval process ensures that the external auditor does not provide any non-audit services to the Company that are prohibited by law or regulation. The Audit Committee has considered the provision of non-audit services by our principal accountants and has determined that the provision of such services were consistent with maintaining the independence of the Company’s principal accountants. All services set forth above under the captions “Audit Fees”, “Audit-Related Fees”, “Tax Fees”, and “All Other Fees” were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to SEC Regulation S-X Rule 2-.01(c)(7)(i).\n\nFinancial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees. \n\nThe Company did not retain its principal accountant to perform Financial Information Systems Design or Implementation services in fiscal year 2023.\n\n34\n\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS \n\nShareholders who, in accordance with SEC Rule 14a-8, wish to present proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy for our 2025 annual meeting must submit their proposals so that they are received by us at our principal executive offices, addressed to our Corporate Secretary, no later than December 3, 2024. Shareholder proposals not submitted for inclusion in next year’s proxy statement and form of proxy, but instead sought to be presented directly at our 2025 annual meeting of shareholders, may be brought before the annual meeting as long as the notice of the proposal is in writing and received by the Company, directed to the attention of the Corporate Secretary, no earlier than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 16, 2025, which is 120 calendar days before the anniversary of this year's annual meeting, nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 15, 2025, which is 90 calendar days before the anniversary of this year's annual meeting. Any such proposal must comply in all respects with the Company’s Amended and Restated Bylaws and with the rules and regulations of the SEC. Upon timely receipt of any such proposal, the Company will determine whether to include it, if requested, in its proxy statement and proxy in accordance with applicable rules and regulations governing the solicitation of proxies. \n\nTo have a nominee included in the Company’s proxy statement and form of proxy for the annual meeting to be held in 2025, notice of such nomination must be submitted by the nominating shareholder on a Schedule 14N to the Company no earlier than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 16, 2025 nor later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on February 15, 2025, with such notice to also be filed with the SEC no later than February 15, 2025. \n\nNo director nominations were received from shareholders in connection with the Annual Meeting.\n\nOTHER MATTERS WHICH MAY COME BEFORE THE ANNUAL MEETING\n\nOur Board of Directors knows of no matters other than those referred to in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders which may properly come before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matter should be properly presented for consideration and voting at the Annual Meeting or any adjournments thereof, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies on the enclosed form of proxy card to vote the shares represented by all valid proxy cards in accordance with their judgment of what is in the Company’s best interest.\n\nANNUAL REPORTS\n\nUpon receipt of a written request, we will furnish, without charge, any owner of common stock of the Company a copy of its annual report as filed with the SEC on form 10-K (the “10-K”) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, including financial statements and the schedules thereto. Copies of exhibits to the 10-K are also available upon specific request and payment of a reasonable charge for reproduction. Such requests should be directed to the Secretary of the Company at the address indicated on the front of this proxy statement. \n\n35\n\nHOUSEHOLDING\n\nThe SEC’s proxy rules permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement to those shareholders. This method of delivery, often referred to as householding, should reduce the amount of duplicate information that shareholders receive and lower printing and mailing costs for companies. The Company and certain intermediaries are householding proxy materials for shareholders of record in connection with the Annual Meeting. This means that:\n\n•Only one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or Proxy Statement and 2023 Annual Report will be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless you notify your broker or the Company to the contrary.\n\n•You can contact the Company by calling (229) 426-6000 or writing Edward L Bagwell at 115 South Grant Street, Fitzgerald, Georgia 31750 to request a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or 2023 Annual Report and Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting and for future meetings or, if you are currently receiving multiple copies, to receive only a single copy in the future. You can also contact your broker to make a similar request.\n\n36\n\n![colonybankcorpinc_prxyxgt2.jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/04/11/0000711669-24-000054_colonybankcorpinc_prxyxgt2.jpg)\n\n![colonybankcorpinc_prxyxgt2a.jpg](https://content.edgar-online.com/edgar_conv_img/2024/04/11/0000711669-24-000054_colonybankcorpinc_prxyxgt2a.jpg)\n"
