Continued approval for _Ziihera_ may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in this confirmatory trial.\n\nZanidatamab is also being investigated in a number of additional tumor types, including Phase 3 trials in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas (GEAs) and metastatic breast cancer (mBC). The HERIZON-GEA-01 trial evaluating the potential of zanidatamab plus chemotherapy with or without tislelizumab as first-line treatment for patients with advanced/metastatic HER2-positive GEAs. The EmpowHER-303 trial is evaluating the potential of zanidatamab in combination with physician's choice chemotherapy for the treatment of HER2-positive mBC for patients who have progressed on, or are intolerant to, previous trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment.\n\n**About the Phase 2b HERIZON-BTC-01 Trial** The Phase 2b HERIZON-BTC-01 trial of zanidatamab was an open-label, global Phase 2b study, which enrolled 87 patients with HER2-amplified, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic BTC (gallbladder cancer, intra-/extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma) into 2 cohorts and included 62 patients with HER2 IHC 3+ BTC. The trial evaluated zanidatamab (20 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) in patients who had received prior gemcitabine-containing therapy. Patients with prior HER2-targeted therapy use were excluded from the trial. All patients were required to have HER2 status confirmed with tissue samples by a central lab. Patients (n=87) were assigned into two cohorts based on tumor IHC status: Cohort 1 (n=80) included patients who were IHC 2+/3+ (HER2-amplified) and Cohort 2 (n=7) included patients who were IHC 0/1+. Tumors were assessed every 8 weeks per RECIST v1.1. The primary endpoint was ORR by independent central review (ICR) in Cohort 1, with secondary endpoints including other efficacy and safety outcomes.\n\n**Investor Webcast on Wednesday, December 11, 2024**The company will host a webcast on Wednesday, December 11, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET / 9:30 p.m. GMT to provide investors an overview of clinical data, patient need and commercialization strategy for _Ziihera_.

Binding of zanidatamab-hrii with HER2 results in internalization leading to a reduction of the receptor on the tumor cell surface. Zanidatamab-hrii induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). These mechanisms result in tumor growth inhibition and cell death in vitro and in vivo.1 In the United States, _Ziihera_ is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive (IHC 3+) biliary tract cancer (BTC), as detected by an FDA-approved test.1 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for this indication based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).1\n\nZanidatamab is not approved anywhere else in the world.\n\nZanidatamab is being developed in multiple clinical trials as a targeted treatment option for patients with solid tumors that express HER2. Zanidatamab is being developed by Jazz and BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) under license agreements from Zymeworks, which first developed the molecule. \n\nThe FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for zanidatamab development in patients with previously treated HER2 gene-amplified BTC, and two Fast Track designations for zanidatamab: one as a single agent for refractory BTC and one in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy for 1L gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA). Additionally, zanidatamab has received Orphan Drug designations from FDA for the treatment of BTC and GEA, as well as Orphan Drug designation from the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of BTC and gastric cancer. \n\n**Important Safety Information**  \n---  \n**WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY****Exposure to ZIIHERA during pregnancy can cause embryo-fetal harm. Advise patientsof the risk and need for effective contraception.**  \n  \n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity** ZIIHERA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In literature reports, use of a HER2-directed antibody during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death.\n\nVerify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of ZIIHERA. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to ZIIHERA during pregnancy or within 4 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZIIHERA and for 4 months following the last dose of ZIIHERA.\n\n**Left Ventricular Dysfunction**\n\nZIIHERA can cause decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). LVEF declined by >10% and decreased to <50% in 4.3% of 233 patients. Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) leading to permanent discontinuation of ZIIHERA was reported in 0.9% of patients. The median time to first occurrence of LVD was 5.6 months (range: 1.6 to 18.7). LVD resolved in 70% of patients.\n\nAssess LVEF prior to initiation of ZIIHERA and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold dose or permanently discontinue ZIIHERA based on severity of adverse reactions.\n\nThe safety of ZIIHERA has not been established in patients with a baseline ejection fraction that is below 50%.\n\n**Infusion-Related Reactions** ZIIHERA can cause infusion-related reactions (IRRs). An IRR was reported in 31% of 233 patients treated with ZIIHERA as a single agent in clinical studies, including Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (25%). IRRs leading to permanent discontinuation of ZIIHERA were reported in 0.4% of patients. IRRs occurred on the first day of dosing in 28% of patients; 97% of IRRs resolved within one day.\n\nPrior to each dose of ZIIHERA, administer premedications to prevent potential IRRs. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IRR during ZIIHERA administration and as clinically indicated after completion of infusion. Have medications and emergency equipment to treat IRRs available for immediate use.\n\nIf an IRR occurs, slow, or stop the infusion, and administer appropriate medical management. Monitor patients until complete resolution of signs and symptoms before resuming. Permanently discontinue ZIIHERA in patients with recurrent severe or life-threatening IRRs.\n\n**Diarrhea**\n\nZIIHERA can cause severe diarrhea.\n\nDiarrhea was reported in 48% of 233 patients treated in clinical studies, including Grade 3 (6%) and Grade 2 (17%). If diarrhea occurs, administer antidiarrheal treatment as clinically indicated. Perform diagnostic tests as clinically indicated to exclude other causes of diarrhea. Withhold or permanently discontinue ZIIHERA based on severity.\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nSerious adverse reactions occurred in 53% of 80 patients with unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive BTC who received ZIIHERA. Serious adverse reactions in >2% of patients included biliary obstruction (15%), biliary tract infection (8%), sepsis (8%), pneumonia (5%), diarrhea (3.8%), gastric obstruction (3.8%), and fatigue (2.5%).

In particular, the Company presents non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure) and its line-item components, as well as certain non-GAAP adjusted financial measures derived therefrom, including non-GAAP adjusted gross margin percentage and non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate. Non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure) and its line-item components exclude from GAAP reported net income (and the related per share measure) and its line-item components certain items, as detailed in the reconciliation tables that follow, and in the case of non-GAAP adjusted net income (and the related per share measure), adjust for the income tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments. In this regard, the components of non-GAAP adjusted net income, including non-GAAP adjusted cost of product sales, SG&A expenses and R&D expenses, are income statement line items prepared on the same basis as, and therefore components of, the overall non-GAAP adjusted net income measure.\n\nThe Company believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors and analysts and that each of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, can enhance investors' and analysts' ability to meaningfully compare the Company's results from period to period, to its forward-looking guidance, and to identify operating trends in the Company's business. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are regularly used by investors and analysts to model and track the Company's financial performance. Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management also regularly uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the Company's business and to make operating decisions, and compensation of executives is based in part on certain of these non-GAAP financial measures. Because these non-GAAP financial measures are important internal measurements for Jazz Pharmaceuticals' management, the Company also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts since these measures allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics the Company uses in assessing its own operating performance and making operating decisions. These non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures; should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP; have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP; and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles in the reconciliation tables that follow. In addition, from time to time in the future there may be other items that the Company may exclude for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures; and the Company has ceased, and may in the future cease, to exclude items that it has historically excluded for purposes of its non-GAAP financial measures. Likewise, the Company may determine to modify the nature of its adjustments to arrive at its non-GAAP financial measures. Because of the non-standardized definitions of non-GAAP financial measures, the non-GAAP financial measures as used by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in this press release and the accompanying tables have limits in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n**_Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements related to: the Company's growth prospects and future financial and operating results, including the Company's 2024 financial guidance and the Company's expectations related thereto and anticipated catalysts; expectations that Xywav will remain the oxybate of choice; expectations of high-sodium oxybate AG royalty revenue in 2024; the ability to generate long-term sustainable growth and value; the Company's advancement of pipeline programs and the timing of development activities, regulatory activities and submissions related thereto, including plans to submit a sNDA for Zepzelca in 1L ES-SCLC in the first half of 2025 and the anticipated launch of zanidatamab in 2L BTC; planned or anticipated clinical trial events, including with respect to initiations, enrollment and data read-outs, and the anticipated timing thereof, including: top-line PFS data from a Phase 3 trial of zanidatamab in 1L GEA, plans to initiate a Phase 1b trial of JZP441 in type 1 narcolepsy patients; and the Company's development, regulatory and commercialization strategy, including the Company's expectations to executing multiple Epidyolex launches through 2024; the Company's expectations with respect to its products and product candidates and the potential of the Company's products and product candidates and the potential regulatory path related thereto; the Company's capital allocation and corporate development strategy; the potential successful future development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities; the Company's ability to realize the commercial potential of its products; the Company's net product sales and goals for net product sales from new and acquired products; the Company's views and expectations relating to its patent portfolio, including with respect to expected patent protection, as well as expectations with respect to exclusivity; the Company's clinical trials confirming clinical benefit or enabling regulatory submissions; planned or anticipated regulatory submissions and filings, and the anticipated timing thereof; potential regulatory approvals; and other statements that are not historical facts.

In August 2023 and July 2024, we made irrevocable elections to net share settle the 2024 Notes and the 2026 Notes, respectively. As a result, the assumed issuance of ordinary shares upon exchange of the Exchangeable Senior Notes has only been included in the calculation of diluted net income per ordinary share, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, in each period up to the date each irrevocable election was made. Net income per diluted share, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP adjusted basis, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 1.3 million shares and 4.7 million shares, respectively, related to the assumed conversion of the 2026 Notes and the associated interest expense, net of tax, add-back to GAAP reported net income of $1.0 million and $10.8 million, respectively, and the associated interest expense, net of tax, add-back to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $0.9 million and $9.7 million, respectively. Net income per diluted share, on a GAAP and on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 7.6 million shares and 8.5 million shares, respectively, related to the assumed conversion of the Exchangeable Senior Notes and the associated interest expense, net of tax, add-back to GAAP reported net income of $5.9 million and $20.0 million, respectively, and the associated interest expense, net of tax, add-back to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $5.2 million and $17.8 million, respectively.  \n2.| Costs related to program terminations.  \n3.| Non-cash interest expense associated with debt issuance costs.  \n  \n**JAZZ PHARMACEUTICALS PLC**  \n---  \n**RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP REPORTED TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED INFORMATION**  \n**CERTAIN LINE ITEMS -

The data includes the top-line results of the Phase 4 DUET (Develop hypersomnia Understanding by Evaluating low-sodium oxybate Treatment) trial, evaluating the effectiveness of low-sodium oxybate on key sleep outcomes in adults with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia (IH). Notably, these DUET data are the first to show prospective improvements on excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), as well as key polysomnography (PSG) outcomes of sleep disruption, among adults with narcolepsy treated with Xywav® (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution. Further, new DUET data evaluating nighttime _Xywav_ treatment in adults with IH demonstrate clinical improvements on daytime symptoms, including sleep inertia measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc). \n\nThe DUET trial is a Phase 4, prospective, single-arm, open-label study to assess the effect of _Xywav_ treatment on EDS, polysomnography parameters, and functional outcomes in adults with narcolepsy or IH. Observed adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of _Xywav_ , with the most common including nausea, dizziness and headache.\n\n\"The new DUET data presented today demonstrate the impact of low-sodium _Xywav_ treatment on key narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia symptoms,\" said Logan Schneider, MD, adjunct clinical associate professor of sleep medicine, Stanford Sleep Center and Consultant Neurologist, Stanford/VA Alzheimer's Center. \"These data build on our confidence that appropriate treatment can meaningfully impact the outcomes that matter to patients and their functioning.\"\n\nPresentation highlights include:\n\n  * **_Xywav DUET Narcolepsy Top-line Results (P166):_** Novel analysis of primary and key secondary outcomes in participants with narcolepsy show improvements in daytime and nighttime symptoms with _Xywav_ treatment compared to baseline across daytime sleepiness and PSG-based measures of sleep disruption, including sleep stage shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep, time spent in deep sleep, and number of awakenings. Specifically, the statistically significant change (least square mean, standard error) from baseline on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was −7.7 (0.9), P<0.0001, while changes for total shifts from deeper to lighter stages of sleep, N3 sleep (deep sleep) duration in minutes, and number of awakenings were −13.1 (3.0), P<0.0001; 45.0 (8.8), P<0.0001; and −3.2 (0.9), P=0.0015, respectively (N=34 each).\n  * **_Xywav DUET IH Top-line Results (P165):_** First presentation of primary and key secondary outcomes in participants with IH show _Xywav_ treatment resulted in improvements in EDS, measured by ESS and Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS). Additionally, improvements were observed across PGIc measures of overall symptoms, with new data on sleep inertia measured within the PGIc. Statistically significant changes (least square mean, standard error) in ESS (N=40) and IHSS (N=36) from baseline to end of treatment were −8.4 (0.7), P<0.0001 and −15.5 (1.5), P<0.0001, respectively. Most participants reported improvement (very much, much, minimally) on the PGIc overall (94.6%; N=37) and PGIc sleep inertia inventory (81.1%; N=37).\n\n\n\n\"These DUET data are the first to show _Xywav's_ impact on polysomnography measures of nighttime awakenings, sleep stage shifts, and deep sleep for people living with narcolepsy, as well as improvements among adults with IH in key outcomes important for daily life,\" said Kelvin Tan, MBBCh, MRCPCH, chief medical affairs officer of Jazz Pharmaceuticals. \"Jazz is committed to our leadership in sleep, as exemplified by our presentations at Psych Congress of the DUET trial data, which studied the effectiveness of low-sodium _Xywav_ on symptoms of narcolepsy and IH by demonstrating improvements in measures which are key for patients to wake up more refreshed with improved wakefulness during the day.\"\n\nThe Psych Congress 2024 presentations are available on-demand through the conference mobile application. Abstracts and posters will also be published on HMP Global's [Psychiatry & Behavioral Health Learning Network](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291477-1&h=4073441727&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hmpgloballearningnetwork.com%2Fsite%2Fpsychbehav&a=Psychiatry+%26+Behavioral+Health+Learning+Network) 30-60 days after the event ends.\n\nA full list of Jazz presentations follows below:\n\n**Presentation Title** |  **Presenting Author** |  **Poster Number**  \n---|---|---  \nEffectiveness and Safety of Low-Sodium Oxybate in Participants With Narcolepsy: Top-line Results From the Phase 4 DUET Study |  L.

Alexander |  P82  \n  \n**About Narcolepsy** Narcolepsy is a chronic, debilitating neurologic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (the inability to stay awake and alert during the day resulting in the irrepressible need to sleep or unplanned lapses into sleep or drowsiness), or EDS, and an inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally.1 Patients with EDS due to narcolepsy experience sleep attacks and, despite fighting the urge to sleep, may unintentionally fall asleep for short periods.2,3 These sleep attacks may happen at inappropriate or potentially dangerous times such as during driving, cycling, eating, or mid-conversation.4\n\nThere is no cure for narcolepsy, therefore this EDS is lifelong and has a substantial negative impact on a person's ability to function psychologically, socially and professionally.5 Patients with narcolepsy are at increased risk for hypertension, cardiometabolic morbidity, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiac arrest, and death.6,7,8,9 As narcolepsy is a chronic condition that requires lifelong, nightly treatment, early access to an effective, low-sodium treatment can transform lives and reduce the impact of narcolepsy on a person's physical and mental health.5\n\n**About Idiopathic Hypersomnia** Idiopathic hypersomnia is an often debilitating, neurologic sleep disorder that goes beyond chronic excessive daytime sleepiness.10,11,12,13 Idiopathic hypersomnia is a 24-hour sleep disorder, and symptoms may include a prolonged but non-restorative main (nighttime) sleep episode of more than 9 hours, or a sleep duration of 11 hours or longer over a 24-hour period; cognitive impairment; long and unrefreshing naps; brain fog, or the inability to focus for long periods of time; and severe sleep inertia (prolonged difficulty waking, with frequent reentries into sleep, confusion, and irritability).10,11,12,13,14 Although there are overlapping clinical features with narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia is a condition with its own specific diagnostic criteria.13,15\n\nIdiopathic hypersomnia is an often debilitating illness that can significantly affect social, educational, and occupational functioning.16,17 In the U.S., approximately 37,000 adult patients have been diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia and are actively seeking healthcare.18 This low number of people may be due to the many difficulties in identifying and diagnosing idiopathic hypersomnia, as well as distinguishing it from other similar sleep disorders. It is estimated that far fewer patients are currently receiving pharmacological treatment for their idiopathic hypersomnia.18,19,20,21\n\n**About Xywav ® (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates) oral solution** _Xywav_ is the only low-sodium oxybate approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. The FDA recognized seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity for  _Xywav_ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy. The Office of Orphan Product Development (OOPD) at the FDA also published its summary of clinical superiority findings for  _Xywav_ for the treatment of cataplexy or EDS in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy by means of greater cardiovascular safety compared to Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) oral solution. The decision of the OOPD is based on the FDA findings that  _Xywav_ provides a greatly reduced chronic sodium burden compared to  _Xyrem_.  _Xywav_ has 131 mg of sodium at the maximum recommended nightly dose whereas other high sodium oxybates have 1640 mg at the equivalent dose.  _Xywav_ is comprised of a unique composition of cations resulting in 92% less sodium, or a reduction of approximately 1,000 to 1,500 mg/night at the recommended dose range of 6 g to 9 g/night.  _Xywav_ is the only oxybate therapy that does not carry a warning in the label related to use in patients sensitive to high sodium intake.\n\n_Xywav_ is also the first and only U.S. FDA-approved treatment option for idiopathic hypersomnia in adults. The FDA recognized seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity for  _Xywav_ for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adults.  _Xywav_ is the only FDA-approved treatment studied across the multiple symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia, such as EDS, sleep inertia (severe grogginess or confusion when waking up), long sleep duration and cognitive impairment.  _Xywav_ can be administered as a twice- or once-nightly regimen for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adults.\n\nThe exact mechanism of action of  _Xywav_ in the treatment of adults with idiopathic hypersomnia and of cataplexy and EDS in narcolepsy is unknown. It is hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of  _Xywav_ are mediated through GABAB actions during sleep at noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons, as well as thalamocortical neurons.1 The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has designated  _Xywav_ as a Schedule III medicine. The DEA defines Schedule III drugs, substances, or chemicals as drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.1,2 Because of the risks of central nervous system (CNS) depression and abuse and misuse,  _Xywav_ is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the XYWAV and XYREM REMS.\n\n**Important Safety Information for Xywav**\n\n**WARNING: CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION and ABUSE AND MISUSE.**\n\n  * _**Central Nervous System Depression**_**XYWAV is a CNS depressant. Clinically significant respiratory depression and obtundation may occur in patients treated with XYWAV at recommended doses. Many patients who received XYWAV during clinical trials in narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia were receiving CNS stimulants.**\n  * _**Abuse and Misuse**_**The active moiety of XYWAV is oxybate or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Abuse or misuse of illicit GHB, either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, is associated with CNS adverse reactions, including seizure, respiratory depression, decreases in the level of consciousness, coma, and death.**\n\n**Because of the risks of CNS depression and abuse and misuse, XYWAV is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the XYWAV and XYREM REMS.**  \n---  \n  \n**_Contraindications_** XYWAV is contraindicated\n\n  * in combination with sedative hypnotics or alcohol and\n  * in patients with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.\n\n\n\n**_Warnings and Precautions_****Central Nervous System Depression**\n\nThe concurrent use of XYWAV with other CNS depressants, including but not limited to opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, sedating antidepressants or antipsychotics, sedating anti-epileptic drugs, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, and/or illicit CNS depressants, may increase the risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, syncope, and death. If use of these CNS depressants in combination with XYWAV is required, dose reduction or discontinuation of one or more CNS depressants (including XYWAV) should be considered. In addition, if short-term use of an opioid (eg, post- or perioperative) is required, interruption of treatment with XYWAV should be considered.\n\nAfter first initiating treatment and until certain that XYWAV does not affect them adversely (eg, impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills), caution patients against hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination such as operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles or airplanes. Also caution patients against these hazardous activities for at least 6 hours after taking XYWAV. Patients should be queried about CNS depression-related events upon initiation of XYWAV therapy and periodically thereafter.\n\n**Abuse and Misuse** XYWAV is a Schedule Ill controlled substance. The active moiety of XYWAV is oxybate, also known as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a Schedule I controlled substance. Abuse of illicit GHB, either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, is associated with CNS adverse reactions, including seizure, respiratory depression, decreases in the level of consciousness, coma, and death. The rapid onset of sedation, coupled with the amnestic features of GHB particularly when combined with alcohol, has proven to be dangerous for the voluntary and involuntary user (eg, assault victim). Physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely.\n\n**XYWAV** **and** **XYREM** **REMS** Because of the risks of central nervous system depression and abuse and misuse, XYWAV is available only through a restricted distribution program called the XYWAV and XYREM REMS.\n\nNotable requirements of the XYWAV and XYREM REMS include the following:\n\n  * Healthcare Providers who prescribe XYWAV are specially certified\n  * XYWAV will be dispensed only by the central pharmacy that is specially certified\n  * XYWAV will be dispensed and shipped only to patients who are enrolled in the XYWAV and XYREM REMS with documentation of safe use\n\n\n\nFurther information is available at [www.XYWAVXYREMREMS.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4291477-1&h=4171610035&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xywavxyremrems.com%2F&a=www.XYWAVXYREMREMS.com) or 1-866-997-3688.\n\n**Respiratory Depression and Sleep-Disordered Breathing** XYWAV may impair respiratory drive, especially in patients with compromised respiratory function. In overdoses of oxybate and with illicit use of GHB, life-threatening respiratory depression has been reported. Increased apnea and reduced oxygenation may occur with XYWAV administration in adult and pediatric patients. A significant increase in the number of central apneas and clinically significant oxygen desaturation may occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea treated with XYWAV. Prescribers should be aware that sleep-related breathing disorders tend to be more prevalent in obese patients, in men, in postmenopausal women not on hormone replacement therapy, and among patients with narcolepsy.\n\n**Depression and Suicidality** In Study 1, the randomized-withdrawal clinical trial in adult patients with narcolepsy (n=201), depression and depressed mood were reported in 3% and 4%, respectively, of patients treated with XYWAV. Two patients (1%) discontinued XYWAV because of depression. In most cases, no change in XYWAV treatment was required. \n\nIn Study 2, the randomized-withdrawal clinical trial in adult patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (n=154), depression and depressed mood were reported in 1% and 3%, respectively, of patients treated with XYWAV. All patients continued XYWAV treatment.\n\nTwo suicides and two attempted suicides occurred in adult clinical trials with oxybate (same active moiety as XYWAV). One patient experienced suicidal ideation and two patients reported depression in a pediatric clinical trial with oxybate. These events occurred in patients with and without previous histories of depressive disorders. The emergence of depression in patients treated with XYWAV requires careful and immediate evaluation. Monitor patients for the emergence of increased depressive symptoms and/or suicidality while taking XYWAV.\n\n**Other Behavioral or Psychiatric Adverse Reactions** In Study 1, confusion and anxiety occurred in 1% and 5% of patients with narcolepsy treated with XYWAV, respectively. One patient experienced visual hallucinations and confusion after ingesting approximately 9 grams of XYWAV.\n\nIn Study 2, confusion and anxiety occurred in 3% and 16% of patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, respectively. One patient experienced visual hallucinations, which led to discontinuation of XYWAV. \n\nOther neuropsychiatric reactions reported with oxybate (same active moiety as XYWAV) in adult or pediatric clinical trials and in the postmarketing setting include hallucinations, paranoia, psychosis, aggression, agitation, confusion and anxiety. The emergence or increase in the occurrence of behavioral or psychiatric events in patients taking XYWAV should be carefully monitored.\n\n**Parasomnias** Parasomnias can occur in patients taking XYWAV.\n\nIn Study 1 and Study 2, parasomnias, including sleepwalking, were reported in 6% and 5% of adult patients treated with XYWAV, respectively. \n\nIn a clinical trial of XYREM (same active moiety as XYWAV) in adult patients with narcolepsy, five instances of sleepwalking with potential injury or significant injury were reported. Parasomnias, including sleepwalking, have been reported in a pediatric clinical trial with sodium oxybate (same active moiety as XYWAV) and in postmarketing experience with sodium oxybate.\n\nEpisodes of sleepwalking should be fully evaluated and appropriate interventions considered.\n\n**_Most Common Adverse Reactions_** The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥5% of XYWAV-treated patients in adult clinical trials in either narcolepsy or IH) were nausea, headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, parasomnia, somnolence, fatigue, and tremor. \n\nIn the pediatric clinical trial with XYREM (same active moiety as XYWAV) that included pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age with narcolepsy, the most common adverse reactions (≥5%) were nausea (20%), enuresis (19%), vomiting (18%), headache (17%), weight decreased (13%), decreased appetite (9%), dizziness (8%), and sleepwalking (6%). The overall adverse reaction profile of XYREM in the pediatric clinical trial was similar to that seen in the adult clinical trial program. The safety profile in pediatric patients with XYWAV is expected to be similar to that of adult patients treated with XYWAV and to that of pediatric patients treated with XYREM.\n\n**_Additional Adverse Reactions_** Adverse reactions that occurred in 2-<5% of adult patients treated with XYWAV in the Open­ Label Titration and Stable Dose Periods of the randomized-withdrawal study in adult patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (Study 1) were fatigue, dry mouth, depressed mood, enuresis, irritability, paresthesia, depression, tremor, somnolence, and muscle spasms. Adverse reactions occurring in 2-<5% of patients treated with XYWAV in the IH study include balance disorder, muscle spasms, fall, paresthesia, snoring, weight decreased, bruxism, confusional state, depressed mood, feeling drunk, and irritability.\n\nAdverse reactions that occurred in ≥2% of patients in clinical studies with oxybate (but not in Study 1) and which may be relevant for XYWAV, were pain, feeling drunk, pain in extremity, cataplexy, disturbance in attention, sleep paralysis, and disorientation.\n\nDiscontinuation: In Study 1, 9 of 201 patients (4%) reported adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from the study (anxiety, decreased appetite, depressed mood, depression, fatigue, headache, irritability, nausea, pain in extremity, parasomnia, somnolence, and vomiting). The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was nausea (1.5%). In Study 2, 17 of 154 (11%) patients across all study periods (excluding placebo during the DB RWP) (up to 42 weeks) reported adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from the study (anxiety, nausea, insomnia, vomiting, fatigue, feeling abnormal, fall, decreased appetite, dizziness, paresthesia, tremor, parasomnia, confusional state, hallucination visual, and irritability). The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was anxiety (3.2%). In Study 1 and Study 2, the majority of adverse reactions leading to discontinuation began during the first few weeks of treatment.\n\nIn the pediatric clinical trial with XYREM (same active moiety as XYWAV), 7 of 104 patients reported adverse reactions that led to withdrawal from the study (hallucination, tactile; suicidal ideation; weight decreased; sleep apnea syndrome; affect lability; anger, anxiety, depression; and headache).\n\n**_Drug Interactions_** XYWAV is contraindicated in combination with alcohol or sedative hypnotics. Use of other CNS depressants may potentiate the CNS-depressant effects of XYWAV.\n\nConcomitant use of sodium oxybate with divalproex sodium results in an increase in systemic exposure to GHB, which was shown to cause a greater impairment on some tests of attention and working memory in a clinical study. A similar increase in exposure is expected with concomitant use of XYWAV and divalproex sodium; therefore, an initial dose reduction of XYWAV is recommended when used concomitantly with divalproex sodium. Prescribers are advised to monitor patient response closely and adjust dose accordingly if concomitant use of XYWAV and divalproex sodium is warranted.\n\n**_Pregnancy and Lactation_** There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of XYWAV or sodium oxybate in pregnant women. XYWAV should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. GHB is excreted in human milk after oral administration of sodium oxybate. There is insufficient information on the risk to a breastfed infant, and there is insufficient information on milk production in nursing mothers. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for XYWAV and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from XYWAV or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\n**_Pediatric Use_** The safety and effectiveness of XYWAV for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy have been established. XYWAV has not been studied in a pediatric clinical trial for narcolepsy or IH. Use of XYWAV in pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy is supported by evidence from an adequate and well­controlled study of sodium oxybate in pediatric patients 7 to 17 years of age, a study in adults showing a treatment effect of XYWAV similar to that observed with sodium oxybate, pharmacokinetic data of sodium oxybate from adult and pediatric patients, and pharmacokinetic data of XYWAV from healthy adult volunteers.\n\nSafety and effectiveness of XYWAV in pediatric patients below the age of 7 years with narcolepsy have not been established.\n\nSafety and effectiveness of XYWAV for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\n**_Geriatric Use_** In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\n\n**_Hepatic Impairment_** The starting dose of XYWAV should be reduced in patients with liver impairment.\n\n**Dosage Modification in Patients with Hepatic Impairment:** The recommended starting dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is one-half of the original dosage per night, administered orally, divided into two doses.\n\n**_Dependence and Tolerance_** There have been case reports of withdrawal, ranging from mild to severe, following discontinuation of illicit use of GHB at frequent repeated doses (18 g to 250 g per day) in excess of the recommended dosage range. Signs and symptoms of GHB withdrawal following abrupt discontinuation included insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, psychosis, lethargy, nausea, tremor, sweating, muscle cramps, tachycardia, headache, dizziness, rebound fatigue and sleepiness, confusion, and, particularly in the case of severe withdrawal, visual hallucinations, agitation, and delirium. These symptoms generally abated in 3 to 14 days. In cases of severe withdrawal, hospitalization may be required.\n\nIn the clinical trial experience with XYREM in narcolepsy/cataplexy patients at recommended doses, two patients reported anxiety and one reported insomnia following abrupt discontinuation at the termination of the clinical trial; in the two patients with anxiety, the frequency of cataplexy had increased markedly at the same time. In the XYWAV clinical trial in adult narcolepsy/cataplexy patients at recommended doses, one patient reported insomnia following abrupt discontinuation of XYWAV. In the XYWAV clinical trial in adult idiopathic hypersomnia patients at recommended doses, six patients reported insomnia, two patients reported early insomnia, and one patient reported visual and auditory hallucinations following abrupt discontinuation of XYWAV _._\n\nTolerance to XYWAV has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. There have been some case reports of symptoms of tolerance developing after illicit use at dosages far in excess of the recommended XYWAV dosage regimen.\n\n**Important Safety Information for Xyrem**\n\n**WARNING: CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION and ABUSE AND MISUSE.**\n\n  * _**Central Nervous System Depression**_**XYREM is a Central Nervous System (CNS) depressant. In clinical trials at recommended doses, obtundation and clinically significant respiratory depression occurred in adult patients treated with XYREM. Many patients who received XYREM during clinical trials in narcolepsy were receiving CNS stimulants.**\n  * _**Abuse and Misuse**_**XYREM is the sodium salt of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Abuse or misuse of illicit GHB, either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants, is associated with CNS adverse reactions, including seizure, respiratory depression, decreases in the level of consciousness, coma, and death.**\n\n**Because of the risks of CNS depression and abuse and misuse, XYREM is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the XYWAV and XYREM REMS.**  \n---  \n  \n**_Contraindications_** XYREM is contraindicated for use in combination with sedative hypnotics or alcohol and in patients with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.\n\n**_Warnings and_ _Precautions_** CNS Depression: Use caution when considering the concurrent use of Xyrem with other CNS depressants. If concurrent use is required, consider dose reduction or discontinuation of one or more CNS depressants (including XYREM). Consider interrupting XYREM treatment if short-term opioid use is required. After first initiating treatment and until certain that XYREM does not affect them adversely, caution patients against hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination such as operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles or airplanes. Also caution patients against these hazardous activities for at least 6 hours after taking XYREM. Patients should be queried about CNS depression-related events upon initiation of XYREM therapy and periodically thereafter.\n\n  * Abuse and Misuse: XYREM is a Schedule III controlled substance. The rapid onset of sedation, coupled with the amnestic features of XYREM, particularly when combined with alcohol, has proven to be dangerous for the voluntary and involuntary user (eg, assault victim).\n  * Respiratory Depression and Sleep-Disordered Breathing: XYREM may impair respiratory drive, especially in patients with compromised respiratory function. In overdoses, life-threatening respiratory depression has been reported. Prescribers should be aware that increased central apneas and clinically relevant desaturation events have been observed with XYREM administration in adult and pediatric patients. Sleep-related breathing disorders tend to be more prevalent in obese patients, in men, in postmenopausal women not on hormone replacement therapy and among patients with narcolepsy.\n  * Depression and Suicidality: In adult clinical trials in patients with narcolepsy (n=781), depression was reported by 7% of XYREM-treated patients, with four patients (<1%) discontinuing because of depression. In the pediatric clinical trial in patients with narcolepsy (n=104), one patient experienced suicidal ideation and two patients reported depression while taking XYREM. Monitor patients for emergent or increased depression and/or suicidality, which require careful and immediate evaluation.\n  * Other Behavioral or Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: Monitor patients for impaired motor/cognitive function or the emergence of or increase in anxiety and/or confusion. The emergence or increase in the occurrence of behavioral or psychiatric events in adult and pediatric patients taking XYREM should be carefully monitored.\n  * Parasomnias: Episodes of sleepwalking should be fully evaluated and appropriate interventions considered. Five instances of significant injury or potential injury were associated with sleepwalking during a clinical trial of XYREM in adult patients with narcolepsy. Parasomnias, including sleepwalking, also have been reported in the pediatric clinical trial and in postmarketing experience with XYREM.\n  * Patients Sensitive to High Sodium Intake: XYREM has a high salt content. In patients sensitive to salt intake (eg, those with heart failure, hypertension, or renal impairment), consider the amount of daily sodium intake in each dose of XYREM.\n\n\n\n**_Most Common_  _Adverse_ _Reactions_** In three controlled adult clinical trials in patients with narcolepsy, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and twice the rate of placebo) in XYREM-treated patients were nausea, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, enuresis, and tremor. In the pediatric clinical trial in patients 7 years of age and older with narcolepsy, the most common adverse reactions (≥5%) were nausea (20%), enuresis (19%), vomiting (18%), headache (17%), weight decreased (13%), decreased appetite (9%), dizziness (8%) and sleepwalking (6%).\n\n**_About Jazz Pharmaceuticals_**Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc is a global biopharma company whose purpose is to innovate to transform the lives of patients and their families.
