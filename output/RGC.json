It is known that there is a significant economic impact and increased parental burden to families that care for children with ADHD and ASD. These positive data from the second efficacy trial bring us one step closer to improving the conditions and quality of life of patients and reducing the negative impact that ADHD and ASD have on patients and their families,” said Yat-Gai Au, founder and CEO of Regencell. \n\n**Second Efficacy Trial**\n\nThe primary objective of the second efficacy trial is to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of Regencell’s standardized TCM formulae in reducing ADHD and ASD symptoms through a holistic approach during the course of a 3-month treatment. \n\nThe second efficacy trial is a non-blinded efficacy trial. Regencell started its recruitment program in August 2021 through direct invitations to members of a non-governmental organization that serves the ADHD and ASD community. Parents and guardians of children with ADHD and ASD were invited to apply for the program. \n\nPatients between the ages of 6 and 12 at the time of the treatment and who were clinically diagnosed with ADHD and/or ASD were eligible to participate in the program. The program required all recruited patients to stop all their existing medications, attend weekly treatment sessions with their parents, and follow the TCM Practitioner’s dietary guidelines, during the 3-month treatment. After a rigorous screening process, Regencell selected 7 children (6 males and 1 female) to participate in the trial. 3 of the patients were diagnosed with ADHD and 4 of them with ASD. All participants resided in Hong Kong. \n\nTo measure the improvement of the children’s symptoms after taking the TCM Formulae in the trial, Regencell used \n\n  1. SKATBT-A3, an assessment developed by Regencell based on patients’ overall body and neurodevelopmental conditions; \n  2. VADRS, an ADHD assessment; and \n  3. ATEC, an ASD assessment. \n\n\n\nSKATBT-A3 is a 48-item questionnaire designed and developed by Regencell to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment in improving ADHD and ASD patients’ symptoms. SKATBT-A3 assesses a patient’s overall physical and neurodevelopmental conditions. SKATBT-A3 includes elements that are conditions of patients usually observed during TCM treatments such as: (i) speech/language/communication; (ii) patients’ sociability; (iii) sensory/cognitive awareness; and (iv) physical health and behavior. \n\nFor example, SKATBT-A3 examines: \n\n  1. the flexibility of the child’s tongue (e.g., prior to treatment, the child may be unable to extend his tongue and had to use his own fingers to pull and stretch his tongue); \n  2. the child’s willingness and proactiveness to participate in social gatherings and to learn (e.g., the child’s ability to focus and engage in school work); and \n  3. involuntary twitching. \n\n\n\nThe effectiveness of a treatment is demonstrated through the child’s post-treatment tongue control and flexibility, the ability to focus for a longer period of time and less frequent involuntary twitching. Regencell’s formulae aim to improve blood flow to the brain and remove blood clot over time, thereby alleviating symptoms such as inflexibility and twitching. The TCM Practitioner also believes that as the child's heart is strengthened, more blood is delivered to the brain, resulting in an improved ability to focus. \n\nAll patients orally consumed the standardized TCM formulae twice daily for 3 months. Improvements in patients’ symptoms were assessed weekly during treatment review sessions with the TCM Practitioner and the children’s parents. \n\n**Second Efficacy Trial Results**\n\nChange in SKATBT-A3 scores\n\nAfter 3 months of treatment, SKATBT-A3 scores of all patients were lower, indicating fewer problems and improvements in symptoms. Percentage improvement of patients ranged between 14% and 56%, with a mean of 37%. \n\nThere were noticeable improvements in the patients’ overall health, ADHD symptoms and ASD symptoms. Common improvements include better sleep quality, reduced temper, better bowel movement and healthier complexion. The most notable improvement were demonstrated by two patients who gained the ability to control their tongues naturally without the aid of their own hands after the 3-month treatment. This is noteworthy because limited tongue function affects verbal communications and language abilities. \n\nChange in VADRS scores\n\nAfter 3 months of treatment, the VADRS scores of 5 patients were lower, indicating fewer problems and improvements in symptoms, while 1 patient’s score remained the same and 1 patient’s score was higher. Percentage improvements of patients ranged between -21% and 62%, with a mean of 21%. \n\nChange in ATEC scores\n\nAfter 3 months of treatment, the ATEC scores of all patients were lower, indicating fewer problems and improvements in symptoms. Percentage improvement of all patients ranged between 4% and 52%, with a mean of 22%. \n\nAmong the 4 subscales of ATEC, we saw the most significant drop in scores in the health/physical/behavior subscale. Constipation, sleeping problems, poor appetite, anxiety/fearfulness, and irritability are common issues among ADHD and ASD patients. Most of the patients suffered from these symptoms before the treatment but these symptoms improved after the treatment. \n\nNo adverse side effects\n\nNone of the patients experienced any adverse side effects after the 3-month treatment. \n\n**An Unmet Need**\n\nMillions of children around the world are diagnosed with ADHD and/or ASD and most of the children diagnosed with ADHD had at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder. In addition to going for behavior therapy, medications are also recommended for children who have ADHD and/or ASD. The two main types of medication for ADHD approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) are stimulants and non-stimulants, while the medication for ASD are usually ‘off-labels’ and are not used in a manner specified in the FDA’s approved packaging label or insert. \n\nSuch medications for ADHD and ASD usually come with side effects such as difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, headaches, upset stomach and mood swings, amongst others. \n\nTo address the need for a natural and holistic treatment for such neurocognitive disorders, Regencell is in the midst of conducting further efficacy trials on its standardized TCM formulae to corroborate the effectiveness of the TCM formulae before it is made available to people around the world. \n\n**Regencell Standardized TCM Formulae**\n\nRegencell standardized TCM formulae are natural, orally administered liquid TCM formulae for the treatment of ADHD and ASD. \n\nIn conducting its second efficacy trial, the standardized TCM formulae were administered to children twice daily for a period of 3 months. \n\nRegencell standardized TCM formulae were developed by our strategic partner TCM Practitioner based on his Sik-Kee Au TCM Brain Theory® and consists solely of natural ingredients without any synthetic components. The TCM formulae have been used for over 30 years to treat ADHD, ASD and many other neurological illnesses, disorders and diseases and have achieved positive clinical treatment results. \n\nThe TCM brain theory explains why a healthy brain is essential in restoring the body’s systems to normal. According to the TCM brain theory, the blockage of or reduced blood flow, and damage of the interconnecting central nervous system, endocrine system and blood circulatory system disrupt the production of hormones and transmission of neurotransmitters, such as melatonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, leading to a defective encoding and decoding of functions, and resulting in deficient or abnormal social behaviors that are the hallmarks of ADHD and ASD. \n\n**Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited**\n\nRegencell Bioscience Holdings Limited is an early-stage bioscience company that focuses on the research, development and commercialization of TCM for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders and degenerations, specifically ADHD and ASD, and infectious diseases affecting people’s immune system such as COVID-19. Regencell has completed its first research study using personalized TCM formulae for the treatment of ADHD and ASD in Hong Kong and aims to launch three liquid-based standardized TCM formulae candidates for mild, moderate and severe ADHD and ASD patients initially in Hong Kong and subsequently in other markets as it deems appropriate.

We are an early-stage bioscience company that focuses on research, development and commercialization of Traditional Chinese Medicine (“TCM”) for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders and degeneration, specifically Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (“ASD”), as well as infectious diseases affecting people’s immune system such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). Our goal is to save and improve the lives of the patients, their families and caregivers and become a market leader for natural and holistic treatments for neurological disorders and infectious diseases globally.\n\nOur TCM formulae candidates are derived from a TCM base formula and an adjustable formula developed by Regencell’s strategic partner TCM Practitioner, Mr. Sik-Kee Au, based on his TCM brain theory, known as “Sik-Kee Au TCM Brain Theory®” (“TCM Brain Theory”). Our TCM formulae candidates have demonstrated reduced severity in patients’ ADHD and ASD conditions, as reflected in lower Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (“ATEC”), Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (“GARS”), Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale (“VADRS”) and Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP)-IV 26-item Parent Rating Scale (“SNAP-IV-26”) assessment scores, using the personalized TCM formula in our first research study. The activity and specificity of the TCM base formula have been optimized by the TCM Practitioner in his prior ADHD and ASD treatments. As of the date hereof, the TCM Practitioner has standardized the adjustable formula into three Fixed Adjusted Formulas for mild, moderate and severe ADHD and ASD conditions. The TCM Brain Theory is not recognized in general literature of TCM or elsewhere. However, the TCM Practitioner has prescribed the TCM formula based on his TCM Brain Theory for over 30 years to treat ADHD, ASD and many neurological illnesses, disorders and degeneration and obtained satisfactory clinical treatment results. Such clinical treatment results are not supported by controlled clinical data or trials.\n\nWe aim to launch three standardized liquid-based TCM formulae candidates for mild, moderate and severe ADHD and ASD patients in Hong Kong first and subsequently to other markets as we deem appropriate. Since March 2020, the TCM practitioner has used his proprietary TCM formula which he has been using over the past 30 years to treat various cold and flu patients, to treat COVID-19 patients. \n\nAs COVID-19 infection and death rates are rising rapidly, there is a pressing need for a COVID-19 treatment that can be widely available and easily accessible. \n\nOn September 2, 2021, Regencell Bioscience Limited (“Regencell HK”), a Hong Kong company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited (the “Company”), entered into a joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Honor Epic Enterprises Limited (“Honor Epic”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, to form a joint venture, Regencell Bioscience Asia Limited under the laws of Hong Kong (the “Joint Venture”). Regencell HK and Honor Epic plan to work together to make this treatment available in the ASEAN countries, India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The principal business of the Joint Venture will be to trade, manufacture, market and distribute TCM formulae products to enable, provide or support the treatment of COVID-19 using TCM in the ASEAN countries, India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n**_Entry into Joint Venture Agreement_**\n\nOn September 2, 2021, Regencell Bioscience Limited entered into a joint venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Honor Epic Enterprises Limited (“Honor Epic”), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, to form a joint venture under the laws of Hong Kong. Pursuant to the JV Agreement, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, Regencell Bioscience Limited and Honor Epic agreed to establish Regencell Bioscience Asia Limited (the “JV”), a private company limited by issuing shares in Hong Kong.\n\n4\n\nPursuant to the JV Agreement, Regencell Bioscience Limited shall contribute 60% of the capital for the JV to fund its operations including trading, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of traditional Chinese medicine formulae products and to procure, enable, provide or support the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, Regencell HK will grant the JV exclusive rights to market and distribute its proprietary COVID-19 TCM treatment (“Regencell Covid Treatment Products”) in ASEAN countries, India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand (“Designated Markets”), for an initial term of two years, pursuant to a license agreement to be entered by and between Regencell HK and the JV. Honor Epic shall contribute 40% of the capital for the JV and shall use its best efforts to market, promote, and distribute the Regencell Covid Treatment Products in the Designated Markets. Regencell HK may appoint two board members in the JV and Honor Epic may appoint one board member in the JV. Sixty percent (60%) of the net profits or net loss of the JV will be distributed to or assigned to Regencell HK and the remaining forty percent (40%) distributed to or assigned to Honor Epic. In the event that Regencell HK decides to dispose of all of its shares in the JV, Regencell HK may require all other shareholders to sell and transfer all of their shares in the JV to a proposed buyer, so long as Regencell HK is holding more than 50% of the equity interest in the JV. Regencell HK is entitled to a right of first refusal if a shareholder receives a third-party offer to purchase the shares of the JV in accordance with the requirements specified in the JV Agreement.\n\n**_The Initial Public Offering_**\n\nOn July 20, 2021, we completed our initial public offering of 2,300,000 Ordinary Shares, $0.00001 par value per share (the “IPO”). The Ordinary Shares were sold at an offering price of $9.50 per share, generating gross proceeds of approximately $21.9 million. On August 17, 2021, the underwriter of the IPO exercised its option to purchase 325,000 additional ordinary shares of the Company at a price of $9.50 per share (the “Over-allotment Shares”). The closing of the sale of the Over-allotment Shares took place on August 19, 2021. The net proceeds of the IPO, including proceeds from the sale of Over-allotment Shares, totaled approximately $22.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and other related expenses of approximately of $2.3 million.\n\n**_Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business_**\n\nThe worldwide COVID-19 pandemic may affect our ability to initiate and complete research studies, delay the initiation of our future research studies, disrupt regulatory activities or have other adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, the pandemic has caused substantial disruption in the financial markets and may adversely impact economies worldwide, both of which could adversely affect our business, operations and ability to raise funds to support our operations.\n\nTo date, we have not experienced material business disruptions or impairments of any of our assets as a result of the pandemic. We are following and plan to continue to follow recommendations from local governments regarding workplace policies, practices and procedures. We expect to continue to monitor the situation and take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees and other business partners. We are continuing to monitor the potential impact of the pandemic, but we cannot be certain what the overall impact will be on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**_Operating Expenses_**\n\nFor the six months Ended | For the six months Ended  \n---|---  \nDecember 31, | December 31, | Change | Change  \n2021 | 2020 | Amount | %  \nOPERATING EXPENSES:  \nSelling and marketing | 8,047 | - | 8,047 | N/A  \nGeneral and administrative (including stock-based compensation of $1,006,353 and nil for the six-month ended December 31, 2021 and 2020) | 2,535,457 | 114,944 | 2,420,513 | 2,106| %  \nResearch and development (including stock-based compensation of $598,005 and nil for the six-month ended December 31, 2021 and 2020) | 1,115,402 | 253,521 | 861,881 | 340| %  \nTotal operating expenses | 3,658,906 | 368,465 | 3,290,441 | 893| %  \n  \n5\n\nDuring the six-month period ended December 31, 2021, we incurred total operating expenses of approximately $3.7 million, an increase of approximately $3.3 million, or 893%, as compared to total operating expenses of approximately $0.4 million during the six-month period ended December 31, 2020.\n\nSelling expenses increased by approximately $8 thousand for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 from nil for the same period in 2020. The increase was mainly due to an increase in marketing and promotional expenses such as website development.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by approximately $2.4 million, or 2,106%, to approximately $2.5 million for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 from approximately $0.1 million for the six-month period ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) approximately $1.0 million in amortization of share-based payments for our general and administrative personnel for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021, (ii) approximately $0.5 million increase in professional fees, such as legal services and public relations services as we became a public company listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, (iii) approximately $0.4 million increase in salaries due to the increase in the number of staff and bonus payments during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021, (iv) approximately 0.3 million increase in rental expenses due to the rental of new office and staff quarters, and (v) approximately 0.2 million increase in traveling and entertainment and others mainly due to more business activities since our operation expanded during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by approximately $0.9 million, or 340%, to approximately $1.1 million for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 from approximately $0.2 million for the six-month period ended December 31, 2020. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) approximately $0.6 million in amortization of share-based payments for our research and development personnel for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021, and (ii) approximately $0.1 million in expenses from medication and materials for product development during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021. The increase may also be attributed in part to an approximately $0.1 million increase in salary expenses.\n\n**_Other Income, Net_**\n\nTotal other income, net was approximately $100 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 and total other income, net was approximately $35,000 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2020.\n\nOther income mainly consisted of cash received from a government grant and interest income. Other income decreased to approximately $100 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 from approximately $35,000 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2020, because the Company did not receive any government grants in respect of COVID-19-related subsidies from the Employment Support Scheme provided by the Hong Kong Government under the Anti-Epidemic Fund during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021.\n\n**_Provision for Income Taxes_**\n\nAs we incurred a loss for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no provision for income taxes was made. No significant penalties or interest relating to income taxes have been incurred during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n**_Net Loss_**\n\nOur net loss increased by approximately $3.4 million, or 996%, to approximately $3.7 million net loss for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021, from approximately $0.3 million net income for the six-month period ended December 31, 2020. Such change was the result of the combination of the changes described above.\n\n6\n\n**_Net Loss Attributable to Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited_**\n\nAfter deducting non-controlling interests of approximately $67,000, net loss attributable to our holding company, Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited increased from approximately $0.3 million net loss for the six-month period ended December 31, 2020 to approximately $3.6 million net loss for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021.\n\n**_Basic and Diluted Loss per Share_**\n\nBasic and diluted losses per share were $0.29 for the six-month period ended December 31, 2021, compared to $0.03 in the same period of 2020. For the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no dilutive shares.\n\n**_Cash_**\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash of approximately $19 million compared to approximately $0.06 million as of June 30, 2021. The increase of cash was mainly due to the receipt of net IPO proceeds from the completion of our IPO in July 2021. The net proceeds of the IPO, including proceeds from the sale of Over-allotment Shares, totaled approximately $22.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and other related expenses of approximately $2.3 million.\n\n**_Shareholder’s Loan_**\n\nOn July 20, 2021, 342,105 ordinary shares were issued to Mr. Yat-Gai Au upon the automatic conversion of $3,250,000 principal amount of the shareholder’s loan under the conversion note that we issued to Mr. Yat-Gai Au at a price of $9.50 per share, the same price as the offering price per Ordinary Shares issued in the IPO. The remaining balance was settled with IPO proceeds in August 2021.\n\n**CONTACT:**\n\n_Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited Investor Relations_\n\nJames Chung\n\nIR@rgcbio.com\n\n**SOURCE:**\n\nRegencell Bioscience Holdings Limited \n\n7\n"

These results are consistent with the earlier analysis announced in February 2022 (the “**EARTH-A Trial** ”), showing RGC-COV19TM is effective in reducing and eliminating COVID-19 symptoms within 6 days, which in turn reduces the risk of hospitalization and death. The results have yet to be peer-reviewed. \n\n“Regencell is committed to delivering alternative treatments that are safe and effective through the use of Traditional Chinese Medicine (“**TCM** ”). Rigorous trials have been conducted and results have shown noticeable improvement in COVID-19 symptoms among our trial participants following the administration of RGC-COV19TM. Following the EARTH-B Trial’s results corroborating the effectiveness of RGC-COV19TM, we believe RGC-COV19TM can be a potential treatment that helps rehabilitate COVID-19 patients,” said Ji Yang Lee (Jay), CEO of Regencell Asia. \n\nWhile emerging new COVID-19 variants continue to remain a threat to the public health, Regencell will continue to work in tandem with its R&D units to develop new breakthroughs designed to transform the way COVID-19 is being managed globally and provide safe and effective treatment for everyone. \n\n**About EARTH**\n\nThe primary objective of EARTH is to evaluate and assess the efficacy of Regencell’s TCM – RGC-COV19TM (Regencell Bioscience (RGCA-CV01) liquid formulation) in reducing and eliminating COVID-19 symptoms through a holistic approach within a 6-day period. \n\nThe EARTH B Trial was conducted in Malaysia from 30 January 2022 until 31 March 2022, when Omicron represented 80% of the COVID-19 cases in Malaysia since 10 January 2022, replacing Delta as the dominant COVID-19 strain. The eligibility criteria for enrolment remained the same as the earlier efficacy trial, requiring all patients to have laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 3 days prior to treatment and with symptoms onset within 5 days prior to treatment. \n\nBased on the above-mentioned criteria, patients who were asymptomatic were rejected and a larger cohort of 51 random individuals qualified and were enrolled for the EARTH-B Trial, as compared to 37 random individuals in EARTH-A Trial. The enrolled patients were between the ages of 11 to 75 and of different races, ethnic backgrounds and socioeconomic backgrounds. All 51 individuals were based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 48 out of the 51 enrolled patients started taking RGC-COV19TM within 3 days of symptoms onset and the remaining 3 patients started taking RGC-COV19TM between 4 to 5 days of symptoms onset. \n\nRegencell Asia set a maximum of 6 days of treatment per patient. Enrolled patients were required to report their COVID-19 symptoms every day according to 3 severity categories (mild, moderate and severe) and the list contained symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, nausea, feeling hot, chills, drowsy, shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, muscle ache and abdominal discomfort. Patients were also asked to identify any other symptoms they were experiencing. Each patient received 2 days of treatment progressively while a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was conducted every 2 days. \n\nWhenever a patient’s RT-PCR test result turned negative or patients no longer had any COVID-19 symptoms (save for Sensory Dysfunction or occasional cough) within the 6-day treatment period, the treatment ended. While receiving the TCM treatment, 50 individuals were fully vaccinated and 1 child below 12 years old was not vaccinated. At the end of the treatment, the total number of patients whose symptoms were completely eliminated within the 6-day treatment period, save for Sensory Dysfunction and occasional cough, were recorded to determine the efficacy. \n\n**About the EARTH-B Trial’s Results**\n\nEfficacy of complete symptoms elimination within the 6-day treatment period\n\nResults from this analysis of 51 trial participants build upon and corroborate previously released data and demonstrate the effectiveness of RGC-COV19TM in eliminating COVID-19 symptoms within 6 days. \n\nOf the 51 patients, 48 patients (representing 94.1% of the patients) had all their mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms eliminated, save for Sensory Dysfunction and occasional cough, within the 6-day treatment period. 17 out of the 51 patients experienced Sensory Dysfunction and among those 17 patients, 11 recovered their sensory functions while the remaining 6 showed improvements at the end of the 6-day treatment period. \n\nOut of the 48 patients, the number of days it took for all symptoms to be eliminated, save for Sensory Dysfunction and occasional cough, within the 6-day treatment period, was 1 day = 3 patients, 2 days = 14 patients, 3 days = 9 patients, 4 days = 13 patients, 5 days = 4 patients, and 6 days = 5 patients. \n\nSymptoms elimination after 1 full dose of RGC-COV19TM\n\nIn this analysis, a higher percentage of COVID-19 patients (90.2% compared to the previous efficacy trial of 83.8%), reported the elimination of one or more symptoms after taking 1 full dose of RGC-COV19TM, with the largest number of symptoms eliminated after 1 day of treatment reported by a patient being 8. The average number of days it took from the start of treatment for all 51 patients to eliminate all symptoms, save for Sensory Dysfunction and occasional cough, was approximately 3.6 days. The largest number of different symptoms reported by patients was 16 and the average number of different symptoms reported was approximately 7. \n\nTreatment leading to negative RT-PCR\n\n12 patients (representing approximately 23.5%) tested negative RT-PCR within the 6 days treatment (Negative RT-PCR in 2 days = 6 patients, 4 days = 6 patients). Since the start of the treatment, the average days taken for these 12 patients to test negative were 3 days. The minimum and maximum days taken for patients to test negative were 2 and 4 days, respectively. 36 patients had all symptoms eliminated, save for Sensory Dysfunction and occasional cough, within 6 days (average approximately 3.4 days) and therefore was not further tested to obtain a negative RT-PCR result. \n\nTaking the treatment within 3 days from symptoms onset vs within 4 to 5 days from symptoms onset\n\nThe recent analysis showed that 48 out of the 51 patients started taking RGC-COV19TM within 3 days from symptoms onset and they took an average of approximately 3.7 days for the elimination of all symptoms, save for Sensory Dysfunction and occasional cough, whereby the maximum number of different symptoms reported by any one individual was 16 and the average number of different symptoms reported was 8. \n\nThe remaining 3 patients who started taking RGC-COV19TM between 4 to 5 days from symptoms onset took an average of approximately 2.3 days for the elimination of all symptoms, save for Sensory Dysfunction and occasional cough, whereby the maximum number of different symptoms reported by any one individual was 8 and the average number of symptoms reported was 5. \n\nVaccination status\n\n50 individuals were fully vaccinated and 1 child below 12 years old was not vaccinated. All 12 patients who tested negative RT-PCR in 4 days were fully vaccinated prior to taking the RGC-COV19TM treatment. All patients who were vaccinated received vaccine from either Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca or Sinovac-CoronaVac, which are the top 3 vaccines distributed in Malaysia. \n\nHigh-risk patients\n\nOut of the 51 patients, 15 patients experienced a combination of dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and/or persistent chest pain. 10 of these 15 patients no longer experienced difficulty breathing and/or persistent chest pain after 1 full dose of RGC-COV19TM. \n\nNo adverse side effects\n\nBased on the patients’ self-reported data, there were no worsening of symptoms during and after consuming RGC-COV19TM and none of the patients experienced any unknown adverse side effects. \n\nNo treatment emergent adverse events\n\nAmong the patients with chronic conditions such as chronic migraine, eczema, asthma, thyroid disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, there were no treatment emergent adverse events and no discontinuation of RGC-COV19TM due to adverse results. \n\nDeath/Hospitalization\n\nAt the end of the EARTH-B Trial, none of the patients was hospitalized and there was no death. The efficacy of RGC-COV19TM was not affected by timing of symptom onset or underlying risk factors. Results were consistent across all ages, gender, races and ethnicity demographic among the enrolled patients. \n\n**More about EARTH**\n\nThere are hundreds of millions of individuals who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 around the world, and some experience post-COVID symptoms such as extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath, problems with memory and concentration (brain fog), heart palpitations, dizziness, chest pain or tightness, joint pain which are now being classified as long-COVID symptoms. \n\nAs long-COVID symptoms have substantial effects on individuals’ quality of life and work capability, Regencell Asia is in the midst of conducting its studies for long-COVID patients using a natural and holistic formula - RGC-COV19TM (RGCA-LCV01). \n\n**About RGC-COV19 TM**\n\nRGC-COV19TM (RGCA-CV01) is an investigational, natural, orally administered liquid formula which aims to reduce and eliminate COVID-19 symptoms. \n\nRGC-COV19TM is a natural formula designed by the TCM Practitioner according to the TCM Practitioner’s brain theory known as “Sik-Kee Au TCM Brain Theory®” and can be taken safely for two to three weeks. In conducting EARTH, the treatment was limited to 6 days in order to evaluate its efficacy in reducing and eliminating COVID-19 symptoms. The “TCM Practitioner” refers to our strategic TCM research partner, Sik-Kee Au, father of our founder and Chief Executive Officer. \n\nAccording to the brain theory, brain functions depend on the oxygen level required for the brain to perform normal cognitive functions. For optimal brain performance, the heart needs to function normally to deliver sufficient oxygen to the brain. When the heart is weakened, the heart’s ability to deliver enough blood to circulate oxygen throughout the body is impaired. When this happens, brain functions are suppressed, resulting in a person experiencing fatigue, nausea, disorientation and reduced immune response. \n\nRGC-COV19TM is designed to strengthen the heart’s functions. According to the brain theory, when the heart is strengthened, it increases blood flow and delivers more oxygen to the brain, resulting in reduced blood clots and restored brain functions. Regardless of the COVID-19 variant, the lungs and heart are where the coronavirus does much of its damage by setting off an inflammatory immune response that ravages infected and uninfected cells alike, leading to tissue scarring and oxygen deprivation which in turn suppress brain functions. RGC-COV19TM is formulated to generate more responsive cognitive functions which in turn stimulate the body’s own healing mechanism. \n\nRegencell began its investigational approach towards COVID-19 treatment when a friend of Regencell contracted COVID-19 in March 2020. To treat his friend, the TCM Practitioner used his proprietary TCM formula which he has been using over the past 30 years to treat various cold and flu patients, including during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The TCM Practitioner subsequently treated 9 voluntary COVID-19 patients in the United States using the proprietary TCM formula. \n\nStudy results showed that the treatment was effective. As Regencell has a mission to save lives, improve patients’ well-being and address unmet needs in the market, Regencell aims to make its natural and holistic treatment available to everyone in need. \n\nFrom March 2020 to August 2021, Regencell set up protocols and procedures to conduct the EARTH efficacy trial in Malaysia and the United States. \n\nRGC-COV19TM is designed to reduce COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, nausea, chills, drowsiness, shortness of breath, persistent chest pain and muscle ache as the medicine works to (i) reduce and clear the mucus and phlegm from the upper respiratory system; (ii) dispel exterior viral pathogen via heavy sweats, urine and excrement; (iii) clear endogenous and liver heat; (iv) detox the liver; and (v) improve body circulation. By applying the TCM Practitioner’s “Sik-Kee Au TCM Brain Theory®”, RGC-COV19TM is also designed to remove blood clots from the brain and restore the patient's brain functions. \n\nRGC-COV19TM (RGCA-CV01) is administered at 1 dose of RGCA-CV01-1Na (approximately 230ml) and 1 dose of RGCA-CV01-2Da (approximately 230ml) each time, with 1 dose of RGCA-CV01-1Na to be taken starting from the night of the first day of treatment and 1 dose of RGCA-CV01-2Da to be taken after lunch the next day, until symptoms are eliminated. \n\n**About Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited and Regencell Bioscience Asia Limited: Breakthrough in TCM formulae designed to save and improve lives**\n\nFor more than 30 years, the TCM Practitioner whom Regencell partners with has treated patients with neurological disorders and infectious diseases. The TCM Practitioner’s TCM formulae candidates are derived from a TCM base formula and an adjustable formula which is developed based on his TCM brain theory, known as the “Sik-Kee Au TCM Brain Theory®”. \n\nBoth Regencell and the TCM Practitioner are committed in giving back to the society and demonstrates its CARE through **C** aring for patients, **A** ccountability by maintaining a high standard of quality and integrity, **R** espect by valuing partnerships, teamwork and harmony and the **E** nthusiasm to improve the life of the underprivileged. \n\nSince its listing, Regencell through a joint venture with Honor Epic Enterprises Limited, formed Regencell Bioscience Asia Limited to offer COVID-19 related treatments to patients in ASEAN countries, India, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as Regencell aspires to be the global market leader for the provision of natural and holistic treatment for neurological disorders and infectious diseases.

According to the latest filing, following the purchases, Mr. Au owns a total of 10,539,159 Ordinary Shares, representing 81.0% of total issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares. \n\nMr. Au commented, “Short and distort schemes used on our stock are negatively affecting our company. These schemes hurt our investors and patients, especially children and their families who are looking for a natural approach to treat attention hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”), autism spectrum disorder (“ASD”) and COVID-19, and have the potential to disrupt our mission to help our patients. I strongly agree with Elon Musk that sophisticated hedge funds are using short selling and complex derivatives to take advantage of small investors. Thus, I will continue to draw a $1 annual salary and no bonus until the company reaches a $1 billion market capitalization and reserve share options for all employees except myself. I put my money where my mouth is and will continue to use my personal funds to purchase company shares to demonstrate my commitment to the Company and my position against short and distort sellers. Based on publicly available data, the Company believes there is a total cumulative short volume of over 19 million shares since the Company’s IPO. I began my share purchases since last year, using my personal funds in order to further our goal to save and improve lives.” \n\nAdditionally, to demonstrate commitment to the Company, all directors and employees who were previously granted stock options upon the Company’s IPO have agreed to a further lock-up undertaking for a period of six months after their stock options become vested. As their stock options are set to vest on July 16, 2022, their shares will remain locked up until January 16, 2023. \n\nMr. Au further said, “I would like to also take this opportunity to also announce that I am currently spearheading a philanthropic project in my own capacity to provide grants to over 10,000 children afflicted with ADHD, ASD, COVID-19 and those in severe financial distress. Istarted providing grants on April 16, 2022 and have already helped over 150 children.” \n\nThe timing, number and value of Ordinary Shares to be further purchased by Mr. Au, if any, will be determined by Mr. Au in his discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Ordinary Shares, general market and economic conditions, available funds and applicable legal requirements. \n\n**About Regencell Bioscience Holdings Limited**\n\nRegencell Bioscience Holdings Limited is an early-stage bioscience company that focuses on the research, development and commercialization of TCM for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders and degenerations, specifically ADHD and ASD, and infectious diseases affecting people’s immune system such as COVID-19.
