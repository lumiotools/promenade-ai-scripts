Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when discussing the Company’s exclusive worldwide distribution rights of certain advanced drone safety systems which are subject to certain conditions, the Company’s commitment to leveraging its expertise in e-commerce to bring advanced technological solutions to consumers, and the ability of the drone safety systems to address key challenges in the industry. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; the impact of the conditions in Israel, including the recent attacks by Hamas, Iran, and other terrorist organizations; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on April 1, 2024 and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nStory Continues\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_\n\nMichal Efraty Adi and Michal PR- IR Investor Relations, Israel[michal@efraty.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZLuyzRaWE-tW149kdHFYHQ6DroPsHV7L59qike_hkRWxBr_UP9n3f-rkEiL4Bjxy5mGZ00cnpR6xonqUa5YKn_TWEMjdwrerF5-Nk4pWx-0=)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

This represents an impressive 83% growth compared to approximately $659,000 in November 2023.\n\nFueled by the high demand of the Black Friday shopping season and consistent customer preference for its products, November 2024 stands as the best sales month in Fort’s history since 2015.\n\n“November is always a critical month for retail, and this year we were able to leverage the holiday shopping period to deliver record-breaking results,” said Victor Hakmon, CEO of Jeff’s Brands. “This milestone underscores Fort’s strong brand appeal and our dedication to meeting customer expectations.”\n\n**About Jeffs’ Brands Ltd**\n\nJeffs' Brands aims to transform the world of e-commerce by creating and acquiring products and turning them into market leaders, tapping into vast, unrealized growth potential.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when discussing the anticipated impact of Fort’s record-breaking sales during Black Friday and November 2024 and the continued growth of its brand appeal. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; the impact of the conditions in Israel, including the recent attacks by Hamas, Iran, and other terrorist organizations; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on April 1, 2024 and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nStory Continues\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_\n\nMichal EfratyAdi and Michal PR- IRInvestor Relations, Israel[ _michal@efraty.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=JXpMC7UWtCJLLdoNzBwdLBbf6A20vPvJSgNY5uNs6xmy78a6arilCwVf64k2mtmmdykqsH0aUjqTVrNcGRfj9eLF5n2LGmJc9lEbw4pJ0iI=)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when discussing the protection of the brand’s innovative product offerings by the registration of the Wellution® trademark, the strengthening of the Company’s presence in the wellness and personal care market, as well as anticipated increases in sales volumes during the upcoming holiday season in Q-4. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; the impact of the conditions in Israel, including the recent attacks by Hamas, Iran, and other terrorist organizations; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on April 1, 2024 and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nStory Continues\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_\n\nMichal Efraty Adi and Michal PR- IR Investor Relations, Israel [michal@efraty.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vf0xx5MNcgNbApZUzRa-ABvPZRBPdBM7KNJpD7p755u6_mXgqUVDGyEgqjV6agkVEGjVT_nMvtH1jOOKN4ohPXLRSOrjJq0viIzFTo2pG7w=)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

Israel, Dec. 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jeffs' Brands Ltd (“Jeffs’ Brands” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: JFBR, JFBRW), a data-driven e-commerce company operating on the Amazon Marketplace, has entered into a binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Deliverz.AI Ltd. (“Deliverz.AI”), a company focused on artificial intelligence (“AI”) powered fully autonomous multi-purpose robotic platforms, as previously announced on November 27, 2024. The LOI, entered into on November 27, 2024, outlines a plan to establish a joint venture (“JV”) to operate exclusively in the United States, combining the strengths of both companies to introduce AI-powered fully autonomous robotic solutions for healthcare logistics in the United States.\n\nDeliverz.AI specializes in autonomous navigation platforms that streamline logistics operations. Their flagship robot, Polly, is already in use at Israel’s Sheba Medical Center, ranked by [ _Newsweek_ magazine](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4UXnBNVKA4f8YxQf9zUtJTtxVwR2lgmaqnFW_KCht03ECK_u6Knc9YSXvW7wy-taw6WgBRKux-_imZWc6lhR3GcEeF_QW6ZTV-pz0Hysvdw=) as the 9th best hospital in the world, where it autonomously delivers chemotherapy drugs across complex hospital environments. The company’s AI-powered platforms are designed for seamless indoor and outdoor navigation, optimizing workflows in healthcare, smart cities, and Industry 4.0 applications.\n\nThe service robotics market is projected to reach $84.8 billion by 2028 growing from $41.5 billion in 2023, according to [MarketandMarkets](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KU9J6_p74m0PpiCJbyVmTqD5dGD3qh4uHWhfM3VkZ6wYx1-HY7AmesKqCSw9pnXKkOkmGwOuTcid2vlg1TkgARF6bdNZ4myYBJRIFolLfSFKD_hr9V77wW4-NC4mTdaUZ_TGh50mo9jHYj65euCCnabjPH2hKk9xx6Q9R7OuEio0LiBConzniJMthV9ve0H-wXrqJ20DFvpOFNjt0uQtSZrmeCMQwSqau3--zcms1GlEiM4aueQMkokDTzIeFZmi_RhPxgziPWMzHoPX5SlSeswueHzXb49bwXpsmwNwNn0p9A38O8zhMEnjhdCFimER). The growing adoption of robots for new applications, the surging use of Interest of Things (IoT) in robots for cost effective predictive medicine and the increasing use of disinfection robots in hospitals are factors driving the growth of this market per [MarketandMarkets](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=KU9J6_p74m0PpiCJbyVmTszMETAu3ZqgYA4JEX4DitEoMLKNcIhyHl4Jr75N3BcLVZoal0oErDgG37_cdSu-dV9-yv5nQCmDR2w8FoHWy2Ublg0_0B5LAUkgpkmK6-PQ86H-yCVxCCwr2Ykp3OcaxMbjPUBumzUnsmHFlBXe1l2hgwh_xYBghyJRSqEgWEp8N2vpB4lA--R8-jUT4sUqw1h43ws88Yi8TQBSd31aBfbOU0VCZ8o63Aibl8cevKl-aeMlA9eGYehETdmSURpfyK2SeJoaDPy8-f9AnNoQX_P9vfsAhww7VJXkHj7UiBAl).\n\nPursuant to the LOI, Deliverz.AI will provide the license for its proprietary robotics technology and operational software to the JV in consideration of a 50% equity stake in the JV, while Jeffs' Brands will invest $1 million for a 50% equity stake in the JV. The investment will be paid according to a phased schedule: $100,000 upon the signing of the definitive agreement establishing the JV, $100,000 when the JV secures its first U.S. pilot project, and the remaining $800,000 will be paid in installments until the end of 2025, based on budgets to be agreed upon in the definitive agreement.\n\nThe JV will aim to partner with U.S. medical centers, deploying robotics solutions to improve logistics efficiency and enhance healthcare delivery. Both companies are committed to finalizing definitive agreements within 30 days, which will include customary closing conditions, compliance with any regulatory approvals and subject to satisfactory due diligence to be completed by each party. In the event that the results of the due diligence are not satisfactory to one of the parties, the LOI will terminate.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when discussing the JV, which is subject to the execution of binding definitive agreements and the completion of satisfactory due diligence, the establishment of the JV and the commencement of its operations in the U.S., including partnering with U.S. medical centers and the projected growth in the service robotics market. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; the impact of the conditions in Israel, including the recent attacks by Hamas, Iran, and other terrorist organizations; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on April 1, 2024 and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_\n\nMichal Efraty Adi and Michal PR- IR Investor Relations, Israel [michal@efraty.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fOhPtDM6mlDp0QrVy93AfJ1iqhhUWROl8tSNsGpHpSctLVmLiydket2egojYk8C21HvLeTYXQhxdkBAHjaEg0NwGbXFaAbhIcYhMw1r-GDI=)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

Brands Ltd \n\nTel Aviv, Israel, Nov. 20, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jeffs' Brands Ltd (“Jeffs’ Brands” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: JFBR, JFBRW), a data-driven e-commerce company operating on the Amazon Marketplace, announces the successful integration of Fort Products Ltd. (“Fort”) with the Company's business, targeting the global pest control products market, estimated to reach revenues of $2.8 billion by 2028, growing from $1.8 billion in 2020, according to [Research Dive](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9C-sARPu1dQ3uYw6VGWXwrTGsEHbyAbAvPxtdfCxlwrQn0nZSu_fHdzkbXov72d7tOxwD9ubTGgRTK7IxdfCFtaZApUhocagGt9CV5t3oLBydReW2GanBd0539QcWj3X). The Company previously announced its acquisition of Fort, which sells pest control products, in March 2023, and since then has been utilizing its unique technology to increase sales of existing products offered by Fort and to identify demand for additional products.\n\nFort’s label brands (“Fort Brands”) currently offers over 120 pest control products on the Amazon Marketplace in the U.K. Earlier this month, the Company announced the expansion of Fort Brands’ products to the Amazon Marketplace in France.\n\nAs previously announced, the Company recently launched a new product line of Fort Brands in France, to tackle the growing bedbug outbreak in the country. The incidence of bedbug infestations in France has been increasing over the past few months, leading to a greater allocation of resources to address the issue, with the 2024 Paris Olympics games coming up in the summer of 2024. According to ANSES, the French health and safety agency, more than one in ten households in France reported bedbug infestations between the years 2017 and 2022. This rising concern extends to various settings, including hotel rooms, trains, and private residences, generating a growing demand for effective bedbug pest control solutions.\n\n\"Our acquisition of Fort Products in March 2023 was more than a transaction; it's an integration of expertise and excellence,\" stated Viki Hakmon, CEO of Jeffs' Brands. \"We are utilizing the robust growth trend in the pest control market to deliver value-driven solutions to our customers while seeking to maximize returns for our investors. This is a testament to our relentless pursuit of excellence and innovation in the e-commerce space.\"\n\n**_About Jeffs’ Brands Ltd_**\n\nJeffs' Brands is transforming the world of e-commerce by creating and acquiring products and turning them into market leaders, tapping into vast, unrealized growth potential. Through our stellar team’s insight into the FBA Amazon business model, we’re using both human capability and advanced technology to take products to the next level.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when we are discussing the ability of our latest Fort Brand product line to address the bedbug problem in France, our intention to persistently introduce new Fort Brand products and our mission and growth and acquisition strategy to deliver value-driven solutions to our customers and maximize returns for our investors. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Registration Statement on Form F-1, as amended, filed with the SEC related to our initial public offering and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_ Michal EfratyAdi and Michal PR- IRInvestor Relations, Israel+972-(0)52-3044404[michal@efraty.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-6NP0bJ6CJCj1zFIhiZhMwgzBW6f_JHzW7ZsK89hk1PAq-SEA4EyThcm1rO0B9c8u3Hwf94At1MmtgfJzaqHwV6FeJJ4wAPZtK6RJfj5nqQ=)\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/09ukWxo0HW7kWBm82tySlg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OGEwZTZmZTAtMzFhZC00YmI5LTk5YWItZjMzY2NlNzM1ZDQxLTUwMDEwODQzNQ==/tiny/Jeffs-Brands-Ltd.png)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

Brands Ltd \n\nTel Aviv, Israel, June 07, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jeffs' Brands Ltd (the “Company” or “Jeffs' Brands”) (Nasdaq: JFBR), a data-driven e-commerce company operating on the Amazon Marketplace, today announced that SciSparc Nutraceuticals Inc. (\"SciSparc Nutraceuticals\"), in which the Company owns a 49% equity interest, has entered into an exclusive license and distribution agreement to sell and market CannAmide™ on the Amazon.com marketplace in Canada (“License Agreement”). The exclusive license was granted by SciSparc Ltd. (Nasdaq: SPRC), a specialty clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focusing on the development of therapies to treat disorders of the central nervous system.\n\nCannAmide™ is an immediate unique palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) oral formulation for the reduction of chronic pain and inflammation.

It has been designated a product license issuance from the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD) from Health Canada, for sale as a supplement within the nutraceuticals market. PEA is a cannabinoid mimetic lipid molecule found throughout the body, including the central nervous system. Similar to cannabinoids, PEA has been shown to have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-convulsant properties.\n\nSciSparc Nutraceuticals’ business focusses on the sale of hemp seeds’ oil-based products on the Amazon.com marketplace, under the brand Wellution™. SciSparc Nutraceuticals plans on expanding its reach by marketing its brand's products in additional global markets and by broadening its products' offering.\n\nPursuant to the License Agreement, SciSparc Nutraceuticals will purchase CannAmide™ at a cost price plus 3% of gross revenues. The License Agreement is for a term of 12 months and may be terminated by either party with 30-days’ advance notice.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands and expanding to FBM; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 10, 2023,and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nStory Continues\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_ Michal Efraty Adi and Michal PR- IR Investor Relations, Israel +972-(0)52-3044404 [michal@efraty.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=oiTe3Q0Tob0Hop_cg9wHO6PpPSd4KPgKyXgx1S3fjVJodxGzHkaBZmBbSOGQz58YZyYqhSY79S9GXAtzWehfhA==)\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tD6nQXIihcsBYXxgT1FrxQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZDlkMzhlYjktOGIwMi00YTQxLTk0NzEtNmQ4NTU3MGYyNWI1LTUwMDEwODQzNQ==/tiny/Jeffs-Brands-Ltd.png)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

Brands Ltd \n\n_Upon the closing which occurred on March 22, 2023, the purchase price was adjusted from $2.5 million and increased to approximately $3 million._\n\nTel Aviv, Israel, March 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jeffs' Brands Ltd (the “Company” or “Jeffs’ Brands”) (Nasdaq: JFBR), a data-driven e-commerce company operating on the Amazon marketplace, today announced that it completed the purchase (the “Closing”) of approximately 49% of the outstanding capital stock of SciSparc Nutraceuticals Inc. ( “SciSparc Nutraceuticals”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SciSparc Ltd. (“SciSparc”) (Nasdaq: SPRC) that owns WellutionTM, a top-selling Amazon.com Marketplace food supplements and cosmetics brand (the “Brand”), for $2.5 million in cash, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement entered into between the Company, Jeffs’ Brands Holdings Inc, a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of Jeffs’ Brands (the “Subsidiary”) and SciSparc on February 23, 2023 (the “Wellution Agreement”). Additional deferred cash payments of approximately $489,330 for price adjustments related to inventory and working capital, will be paid in five equal monthly installments, beginning in May 2023 (the “Price Adjustment”) pursuant to an addendum to the Wellution Agreement entered into between the Company, the Subsidiary and SciSparc on March 22, 2023. As collateral for the payment in full of the Price Adjustment, SciSparc will hold back such number of shares of common stock of SciSparc Nutraceuticals, equal to the outstanding due amount of the Price Adjustment (the “Holdback Shares”). The stock interest of Jeffs’ Brands in SciSparc Nutraceuticals will be held by the Subsidiary.\n\nAlso pursuant to the Wellution Agreement, in connection with the Closing, the Company will issue 247,415 of its ordinary shares to SciSparc and SciSparc will issue 360,297 of its ordinary shares to the Company in a mutual share exchange at an aggregate value of $288,238, which was adjusted from $300,000, pursuant to the 4.99% ownership limit included in the Wellution Agreement (the “Exchange Shares”). The number of the Exchange Shares acquired by each company was calculated based on the average closing price of the relevant company’s shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately prior to the Closing. In addition, at the Closing, the Company and SciSparc Nutraceuticals entered into a consulting agreement by which the Company will provide management services for the Brand for a monthly fee of $20,000; in addition the Company received a signing bonus of $51,000. The consulting agreement is for an undefined period of time, and may be terminated by either party with 30-days’ advance notice.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Brand is profitable with millions of dollars in gross annual sales on the Amazon marketplace.\n\nThe Brand sells dozens of hemp-based, top-ranked products, including hemp gummies, hemp oil capsules, hemp gel, hemp cream, detox pills, height pills, antibacterial creams, and anti-aging creams, among other beauty and hair treatment products that are all manufactured in the United States.\n\nThe Brand offers eight variations of natural hemp candy supplements under two parent Amazon Standard Identification Number (each, an “ASIN”) on Amazon that are differentiated by their hemp oil potency. The leading parent ASIN, that was launched in 2019, has received over 26,500 reviews and has consistently ranked as the #1 best seller in the category. In total, the Brand had approximately 40,000 product reviews to date, most of which are 4 and 5-star reviews.\n\nMr. Oz Adler, the Chairman and a director of the Company is the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of SciSparc, Mr. Amitai Weiss, the Chairman of SciSparc, is a director of Jeff’s Brands, and Mr. Moshe Revach is a member of the board of directors of both the Company and SciSparc.\n\nNeither the SciSparc Nutraceuticals stock to be received by the Company nor the Exchange Shares will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or any states' securities laws and such stock and Exchange Shares may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.\n\n**_About Jeffs’ Brands Ltd_**\n\nJeffs' Brands is transforming the world of e-commerce by creating and acquiring products and turning them into market leaders, tapping into vast, unrealized growth potential.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when we are discussing the satisfaction of the future cash payments to be paid by the Company and the issuance of the Holdback Shares, the completion of the mutual share exchange and the performance of the Brand. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Registration Statement on Form F-1, as amended, filed with the SEC related to our initial public offering and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_\n\nMichal Efraty Adi and Michal PR- IR Investor Relations, Israel +972-(0)52-3044404 _michal@efraty.com_\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Z4GzBMUHOMw3VEpzH5zijw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YzgwNDEwMDgtZmZjMi00OWVkLWFkYzEtNmMzOGZjYzkyMjk0LTUwMDEwODQzNQ==/tiny/Jeffs-Brands-Ltd.png)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"

Brands Ltd \n\n_The Company signed a non- binding letter of intent to acquire 70% stake in cutting-edge laser-based technology company, developing anti-drone solutions_\n\nTel Aviv, Israel, Dec. 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jeffs' Brands Ltd (“Jeffs’ Brands” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: JFBR, JFBRW), a data-driven e-commerce company operating on the Amazon Marketplace, signed a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) with Sky Growth Partners Ltd. (“Sky Growth”), to invest in an innovative Digital Light Processing (DLP) laser-based system for counter-drone solutions, initially for the defense sector (the “Investment”).\n\nAccording to MarketsandMarkets1, the anti-drone market, which includes, laser, electronic and kinetic systems, for military, homeland security, and commercial platforms was valued at $1.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $5.2 billion in 2028.\n\nAccording to the LOI, as previously announced on December 14, 2023, Sky Growth will establish and transfer all of its rights in the technology to a new Israeli company that will develop, manufacture and market the technology (\"NewCo\"). Following an investment of $2 million by Jeffs’ Brands, it will hold a 70% equity interest in NewCo. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the LOI, the Company will establish a credit line of up to $250,000 bearing an annual interest of 8% for the utilization by NewCo for a limited time period, subject to certain conditions as to be approved by the parties. The LOI also includes certain milestone conditions that if achieved by NewCo, will grant the founders, for no additional consideration, additional equity interests in NewCo.\n\nNewCo plans on developing a technological system based on a pending patent. According to the LOI, NewCo will develop, manufacture and market an electro-optical defense system, based on a laser combined with DLP, which, upon the successful completion of its development, will provide a stationary or mobile dynamic protection system to disrupt the operation of cameras located on drones and unmanned or manned aircrafts that are remotely operated.\n\nThe system will be able to neutralize any visual systems such as cameras that are installed on drones and other aerial and non-aerial objects. The laser-based system will potentially be in use for defense and commercial applications, such as: neutralizing drone attacks, protecting against commercial espionage, strategic infrastructure protection and more.\n\nThe Investment is subject to the successful completion of due diligence, the execution of binding definitive agreements with respect to the Investment and compliance with any regulatory requirements and approvals.\n\nStory Continues\n\n**About Jeffs’ Brands Ltd**\n\nJeffs' Brands is transforming the world of e-commerce by creating and acquiring products and turning them into market leaders, tapping into vast, unrealized growth potential.

Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as “believe,” “expect,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “estimate,” “anticipate” or other comparable terms. For example, we are using forward-looking statements when discussing the growth of the anti-drone market, the execution of binding definitive agreements with respect to the Investment, the completion of the Investment and the successful development of the laser-based technology for the protection against drone vision. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to adapt to significant future alterations in Amazon’s policies; our ability to sell our existing products and grow our brands and product offerings, including by acquiring new brands; our ability to meet our expectations regarding the revenue growth and the demand for e-commerce; the overall global economic environment; the impact of competition and new e-commerce technologies; general market, political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate; projected capital expenditures and liquidity; the impact of possible changes in Amazon’s policies and terms of use; and the other risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), on April 10, 2023 and our other filings with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n_Investor Relations Contact:_ Michal Efraty Adi and Michal PR- IR Investor Relations, Israel +972-(0)52-3044404 [_michal@efraty.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1d19W_Xv_ZrZG83Ae5H4OZ5L0Iw5_Waxb2eksqWYby818npF8cOv9DPTn7UNDZSy4r-qjzubWFisno4TAbEarbyvGCfoXv7SlOlEgBMXusg=)\n\n1 [_https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/anti-drone-market-177013645.html?gad_source=1 &gclid=CjwKCAiA1fqrBhA1EiwAMU5m_9K2OlwJhRMqsjklT8LQdVxUZ00wawI8y0Tijr39A69ywzkTVyDeDRoCFHsQAvD_BwE_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=n7dA-F463n793ENKSLSkeW3fEbiEVOM_Ccy76ajQAW1niDV7LXNOStidfvvmltUKmAFhXcHDmEiCdqLl3Gv4IxWMHquafXmi2VIF-VXeV00zZwtI9rvtf0MS2PPA6YYVSGYPryOkcPjtNVgGFqrGnOEKe7VjCFTRoCcCo8ResVSWTGULC3YsxZYh0zmf_q8V5CT6QMQWzFhMFU61NBsI54hDQ9yI6n2vX-UbUXeUaHm6GqofrFL2XMOHNzH_41v5KyYH5zm-GNYcpIRs-OoDJr2XDRH7xiBjtERCfHdULFZtm8rMDPM7SAODPcrHKF3kvi-n-6pi-chA-CHJEyPXzMdZTJaUwTpCjN9Tng1KY1l2VeoW_ZxLhW6_5Qs7H8jHdidhrbaL_0rTnLGmRUCYTSaXvgUUCgXG6TY8ADHeYSPfc5pxkAytbQHCph5zOuG5rmpmJxdeSNU9Xm5mjJ2rI7b82vR5Fst3mX4174Nyghy7HVf4TUuZZxCjpvlYRPjmVDsxfxRI3wm6Dfqyw0XABS6fL2Iler48hhWjrLQIgv8=)\n\n![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zguobGyWyJZ8VrZh_EPcCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OWVjOWUxMjEtZTIyZS00MjVjLTg5YzEtNGYxM2Y4ZWQzMmI2LTUwMDEwODQzNQ==/tiny/Jeffs-Brands-Ltd.png)\n\nView Comments \n\n[Terms ](https://guce.yahoo.com/terms?locale=en-US) and [Privacy Policy ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-policy?locale=en-US)\n\n[Privacy Dashboard ](https://guce.yahoo.com/privacy-dashboard?locale=en-US)\n\n## Recommended Stories\n\nWaiting for permission\n\nAllow microphone access to enable voice search\n\nTry again.\n\nTry saying\n"
