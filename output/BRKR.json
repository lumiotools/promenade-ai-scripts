Launched in 2022, the CellScape platform has advanced the field of spatial proteomics with differentiated quantitative performance enabled by a unique combination of best-in-class resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. CellScape captures the entire continuum of protein expression in a biological sample—from least to most abundant—while capturing fine morphological details. CellScape utilizes directly-labeled primary antibodies, enabling a robust and modular chemistry that allows researchers to build assays by combining panels and/or individual markers, even after the conclusion of an experimental run. With this new technology, Bruker has further advanced the CellScape chemistry with EpicIF (Enhanced photobleaching in cyclic immunofluorescence), which expands the range of compatible commercially available fluorophore conjugated antibodies by nearly 10-fold, simplifies assay development, and increases throughput by up to 2-fold. EpicIF enhances photobleaching efficacy combining a proprietary reagent with visible light to gently erase fluorescence signal from nearly any fluorophore and, like the prior version, the epitopes are preserved while maintaining tissue integrity. \n\n![Human FFPE tonsil, 48-plex proteomics assay captured on the CellScape Spatial Proteomics Instrument \\(inset\\) using EpicIF technology \\(Photo: Business Wire\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20241108899571/en/2298550/4/Human_FFPE_tonsil_cellscape_spatial.jpg)\n\nHuman FFPE tonsil, 48-plex proteomics assay captured on the CellScape Spatial Proteomics Instrument (inset) using EpicIF technology (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nEpicIF is supported by the concurrent release of a new version of the software. The new software, CellScape™ Navigator, also introduces a more intuitive user interface and easy experiment setup. Both EpicIF and CellScape Navigator will be available as upgrades to current CellScape instruments. “This breakthrough gives scientists an unmatched level of flexibility in their highly multiplexed IF experiments,” said Ranga Partha, PhD, Senior Vice President of Product Management and Marketing at Bruker Spatial Biology. “This new advancement builds on the best-in-class performance of the CellScape, which already offers differentiated quantitative performance, reliability, and modularity at any time. Now, by enabling the erasure of previously photostable fluorophore signals, researchers can choose a wider selection of antibody conjugates than ever before. In addition, EpicIF enables compatibility of the CellScape platform with additional fluorescent readouts, such as RNA-ISH. It’s a leap forward in versatility for high-throughput spatial proteomics and we’re thrilled to offer this transformative technology to our customers.” \n\nOliver Braubach, PhD, Director of R&D Assays at Bruker Spatial Biology, added, “We have developed a solution that overcomes the limitations of traditional multiplexing. The ability to erase signal from a wide range of organic fluorescent dyes without damaging tissues not only simplifies workflows, but also allows scientists to use antibodies validated in other workflows, providing cost and time savings on assay optimization. The use of directly-labeled primary antibodies also eliminates the cross-reactivity observed in other spatial proteomic techniques that rely on secondary antibodies.\" Bruker Spatial Biology will be sharing more about this new advancement at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 2024 Annual Meeting from Nov 8-10 in Houston, Texas at booth #419.

Laukien, Bruker’s President and CEO, commented: “Bruker has again posted double-digit year-over-\nyear CER revenue growth, and above-market organic revenue growth, in Q3 and year-to-date. This is\na testament to our Project Accelerate transformation, and to our operational excellence processes driving\nimprovements in our strategic acquisitions. We have delivered sequential operating margin improvements in Q3,\nand we expect further sequential margin improvements, along with double-digit CER revenue growth, also in the\nfourth quarter.”\nHe continued: “Despite biopharma and China recovery delays, orders for our differentiated post-genomic,\nmultiomics, cleantech, semicon and diagnostics solutions are gradually improving, with upper mid-single digit BSI\norganic bookings growth in Q3 year-over-year. However, nascent biopharma and China recoveries will not\nbenefit our fiscal year 2024 anymore, and accordingly we are lowering our FY2024 guidance. Integrating and\nimproving our strategic acquisitions is making good progress and will further accelerate Bruker’s remarkable\ntransformation. We are confident in our ability to drive above-market organic revenue growth with significant\nmargin expansion in 2025.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nBruker’s revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $864.4 million, an increase of 16.4% compared to $742.8\nmillion in the third quarter of 2023.

Bruker’s high-performance scientific instruments and high-\nvalue analytical and diagnostic solutions enable scientists to explore life and materials at molecular, cellular, and\nmicroscopic levels. In close cooperation with our customers, Bruker is enabling innovation, improved productivity,\nand customer success in post-genomic life science molecular and cell biology research, in applied and\nbiopharma applications, in microscopy and nanoanalysis, as well as in industrial and cleantech research, and\nnext-gen semiconductor metrology in support of AI. Bruker offers differentiated, high-value life science and\ndiagnostics systems and solutions in preclinical imaging, clinical phenomics research, proteomics and\nmultiomics, spatial and single-cell biology, functional structural and condensate biology, as well as in clinical\nmicrobiology and molecular diagnostics. For more information, please visit www.bruker.com.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-\nGAAP gross profit; non-GAAP gross profit margin; non-GAAP operating income; non-GAAP operating income\nmargin; non-GAAP SG&A expense; non-GAAP interest and other income (expense), net; non-GAAP profit\nbefore income taxes; non-GAAP income tax rate; non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per\nshare. These non-GAAP measures exclude costs related to restructuring actions, acquisition and related\nintegration expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and other non-operational costs.\nWe also may refer to constant-exchange rate (CER) currency revenue growth and free cash flow or use which\nare also non-GAAP financial measures. We define the term CER currency revenue as GAAP revenue excluding\nthe effect of changes in foreign currency translation rates. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by\noperating activities less additions to property, plant, and equipment. We believe free cash flow is a useful\nmeasure to evaluate our business because it indicates the amount of cash generated after additions to property,\nplant, and equipment that is available for, among other things, acquisitions, investments in our business,\nrepayment of debt and return of capital to shareholders.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, the\nfinancial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by other companies, and therefore, may not be comparable among companies. We\nbelieve these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our\nperformance, however, we urge investors to review the reconciliation of these financial measures to the\ncomparable GAAP financial measures included in the accompanying tables, and not to rely on any single\nfinancial measure to evaluate our business. Specifically, management believes that the non-GAAP measures\nmentioned above provide relevant and useful information which is widely used by analysts, investors and\ncompetitors in our industry, as well as by our management, in assessing both consolidated and business unit\nperformance.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because\nour management believes this provides a more comparable measure of our continuing business by adjusting for\ncertain items that are not reflective of the underlying performance of our business. These measures may also be\nuseful to investors in evaluating the underlying operating performance of our business and forecasting future\nresults. We regularly use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage, and evaluate\nour business results and make operating decisions. We also measure our employees and compensate them, in\npart, based on certain non-GAAP measures and use this information for our planning and forecasting activities.\nAdditional information relating to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release and reconciliations\nto the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in the tables accompanying this press\nrelease following our GAAP financial statements.\nWith respect to our outlook for 2024 non-GAAP organic revenue, non-GAAP M&A revenue, non-GAAP constant\nexchange rate (CER) revenue and non-GAAP EPS, we are not providing the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measures or corresponding reconciliations to such GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking\nbasis, because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty certain items that may affect such measures\ncalculated and presented in accordance with GAAP without unreasonable effort. Our expected non-GAAP\norganic revenue and EPS ranges exclude primarily the future impact of restructuring actions, unusual gains and\nlosses, acquisition-related expenses and purchase accounting fair value adjustments. These reconciling items\nare uncertain, depend on various factors outside our management’s control and could significantly impact, either\nindividually or in the aggregate, our future period revenues and EPS presented in accordance with GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAny statements contained in this press release which do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section\n21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements regarding our fiscal year 2024\nand 2025 financial outlook, our outlook for reported revenue growth, organic revenue growth, M&A revenue\ngrowth contributions, CER currency revenue growth, margin improvements, foreign currency translation revenue\nimpact and non-GAAP EPS; management’s expectations for the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions; and\nfor future financial and operational performance and business outlook; future economic conditions; and\nstatements found under the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section of this release.
