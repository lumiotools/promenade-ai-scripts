The notes will pay interest on a semi-annual basis. \n\nConcurrently with the consummation of the Offering, we amended our existing credit agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity of our revolving credit facility and amend the interest rate applicable to any loans under our revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement Amendment”). \n\nWe used the net proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on hand, to fund the redemption of all of our 7.0% Senior Notes due 2026 and to pay all fees and expenses related to the Offering and the Credit Agreement Amendment. \n\nThe notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and other applicable securities laws. Within the United States, the notes will only be offered to persons who are reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Outside the United States, the notes will only be offered to persons other than “U.S. persons,” as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act, in offshore transactions in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. \n\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes or any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. \n\nSome of the statements in this press release are “forward-looking” and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These “forward-looking” statements include statements relating to, among other things, the Offering, the Credit Agreement Amendment and the intended use of proceeds of the Offering. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from the statements set forth in this press release, including market conditions and the risks and uncertainties referenced from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The notes will pay interest on a semi-annual basis. The price to investors will be 100% of the principal amount of the notes. The issuance of the notes is expected to close on September 26, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. \n\nConcurrently with the consummation of the Offering, we intend to amend our existing credit agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity of our revolving credit facility and amend the interest rate applicable to any loans under our revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement Amendment”). \n\nWe intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand, to fund the redemption of all of our existing 7.0% Senior Notes due 2026 and to pay all fees and expenses related to the Offering and the Credit Agreement Amendment. The consummation of the Offering is not contingent upon the closing of the Credit Agreement Amendment and the closing of the Credit Agreement Amendment is not contingent upon the consummation of the Offering. \n\nThe notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and other applicable securities laws. Within the United States, the notes will only be offered to persons who are reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act. Outside the United States, the notes will only be offered to persons other than “U.S. persons,” as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act, in offshore transactions in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. \n\nThis press release is neither an offer to sell nor the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes or any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. \n\nSome of the statements in this press release are “forward-looking” and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These “forward-looking” statements include statements relating to, among other things, the Offering, the Credit Agreement Amendment and the intended use of proceeds of the Offering.
