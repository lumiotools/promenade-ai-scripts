Announces Receipt of Notice from Nasdaq\")\n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\nNEW YORK, Nov. 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTNP) (“Titan”) today reported that it received a notice (the “5250 Notice”) on November 22, 2024 from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) advising the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements under the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (“Rule 5250”) as a result of its failure to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the “Q3 Form 10-Q”) in a timely manner.\n\nUnder Nasdaq rules, the Company has 60 calendar days from receipt of the 5250 Notice or until January 21, 2025, to submit a plan to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. If Nasdaq accepts the Company’s plan, then Nasdaq may grant an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the due date of the Q3 Form 10-Q, or until May 19, 2025, to regain compliance.\n\nIn response to the Notice, the Company is working to file the Q3 Form 10-Q as soon as possible in order to regain compliance with the Listing Rule. However, if the Company does not submit the Q3 Form 10-Q by January 21, 2025, the Company will submit a plan by such date to Nasdaq that outlines, as definitively as possible, the steps the Company will take to promptly file the Q3 Form 10-Q.\n\nAdditionally, on November 25, 2024, the Company received a notice (the “5605 Notice”) from Nasdaq advising the Company that, following the appointment of Brynner Chiam as Acting Principal Executive Officer and Acting Principal Financial Officer of the Company on November 6, 2024, the Company no longer complies with Nasdaq’s audit committee requirements as set forth in Listing Rule 5605 (“Rule 5605”). Nasdaq advised that consistent with Listing Rule 5605(c)(4), Nasdaq will provide the Company with a cure period in order to regain compliance with Rule 5605: (i) until the earlier of the Company’s next annual shareholders’ meeting or November 6, 2025; or (ii) if the next annual shareholders’ meeting is held before May 5, 2025, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than May 5, 2025.\n\nThe Company intends to appoint an additional independent director to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee prior to the end of the cure periods.\n\n**About Titan Pharmaceuticals**\n\nTitan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company\nTitan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Titan” or the “Company” or “we,” “our” or “us”) is a pharmaceutical company that was previously developing therapeutics utilizing the\nproprietary long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura®, for the treatment of select chronic diseases for which steady state delivery of a drug has the potential to provide an\nefficacy and/or safety benefit. ProNeura consists of a small, solid implant made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate and a drug substance. The resulting product is a solid\nmatrix that is designed to be administered subdermally in a brief, outpatient procedure and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period.\nOur first product based on the ProNeura technology was Probuphine® (buprenorphine implant), which is approved in the United States, Canada and the European Union\n(“EU”) for the maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder in clinically stable patients taking 8 milligrams or less a day of oral buprenorphine. While Probuphine continues to\nbe commercialized in the EU (as Sixmo™) by another company that had acquired the rights from us, we discontinued commercialization of the product in the United States\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020 and subsequently sold the product in September 2023. Discontinuation of our commercial operations allowed us to focus our limited resources\non product development programs and transition back to a product development company.\nIn December 2021, we announced our intention to work with our financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, potentially including an\nacquisition, merger, reverse merger, other business combination, sales of assets, licensing or other transaction. In June 2022, we implemented a plan to reduce expenses and\nconserve capital that included a company-wide reduction in salaries and a scale back of certain operating expenses to enable us to maintain sufficient resources as we pursued\npotential strategic alternatives. In July 2022, David Lazar and Activist Investing LLC acquired an approximately 25% ownership interest in Titan, filed a proxy statement and\nnominated six additional directors, each of whom was elected to our board of directors (the “Board”) at a special meeting of stockholders held on August 15, 2022 (the “Special\nMeeting”). The exploration and evaluation of possible strategic alternatives by the Board has continued following the Special Meeting. Following the election of the new\ndirectors at the Special Meeting, Dr. Marc Rubin was replaced as our Executive Chairman, and David Lazar assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. In connection with the\ntermination of his employment as Executive Chairman, Dr. Rubin received aggregate severance payments of approximately $0.4 million. In December 2022, we implemented\nadditional cost reduction measures including a reduction in our workforce. In June 2023, David Lazar sold his approximately 25% ownership interest in Titan to Choong Choon\nHau. Mr. Lazar resigned his position as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer in April 2024. Our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Seow Gim Shen, assumed the position\nas our Chief Executive Officer in April 2024.\nOn September 1, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), we closed on the sale of certain ProNeura assets, including our portfolio of drug addiction products, in addition to other early\ndevelopment programs based on the ProNeura drug delivery technology (the “ProNeura Assets”). In July 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset\nPurchase Agreement”) with Fedson, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Fedson”), for the sale of the ProNeura Assets. Our addiction portfolio consisted of the Probuphine and\nNalmefene implant programs. The ProNeura Assets constituted only a portion of our assets. In August 2023, we entered into an Amendment and Extension Agreement (the\n“Amendment”) to the Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Fedson agreed to purchase our ProNeura Assets for a purchase price of $2.0 million, consisting of (i)\n$500,000 in readily available funds, paid in full on the Closing Date, (ii) $500,000 in the form of a promissory note due and payable on October 1, 2023 (the “Cash Note”) and\n(iii) $1,000,000 in the form of a promissory note due and payable on January 1, 2024 (the “Escrow Note”). We will also be eligible to receive potential milestone payments of\nup to $50 million on future net sales of the products and certain royalties on future net sales of the products. As further consideration, Fedson assumed all liabilities related to a\npending employment claim against us. On the Closing Date, Fedson delivered a written guaranty by a principal of Fedson of all of Fedson’s obligations under both the Cash\nNote and Escrow Note. The Cash Note included provisions, which Fedson has exercised, allowing Fedson to extend the payment of the Cash Note to November 1, 2023 and\nagain to December 1, 2023 upon payment of $5,000 for each extension. The Cash Note and Escrow Note were paid in December 2023 and January 2024, respectively. We\nreceived the funds from the escrow account in February 2024.\n5\nIn April 2024, David Lazar, our Chief Executive Officer, Kate Beebe DeVarney, Ph.D., our President and Chief Operating Officer and a member of our Board of Directors,\nand three other members of our Board of Directors, Eric Greenberg, Matthew C. McMurdo and David Natan, resigned their positions with the Company. Pursuant to the terms\nof their respective settlement agreements, we made payments in aggregate of approximately $1.2 million. The Board of Directors subsequently appointed Firdauz Edmin Bin\nMokhtar and Francisco Osvaldo Flores García as independent directors of the Company to fill two of the vacancies created by the resignations. In addition, Dato Seow Gim\nShen was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer and will continue to serve as the Company’s Chairman of the Board, which he has done since\nOctober 12, 2023.\nAll share and per share amounts give retroactive effect to a 1-for-20 reverse stock split effected on January 8, 2024 (see Note 6. Stockholders’ Equity).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the\ninformation and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statement presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring\nadjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, or any future interim periods.\nThe balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 is derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all the information and footnotes required by\nGAAP for complete financial statements. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes\nthereto included in the Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.1 million, which we believe is sufficient to fund our planned operations through the third\nquarter of 2025. We are exploring several financing and strategic alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.\nGoing Concern Assessment\nWe assess going concern uncertainty in our condensed financial statements to determine if we have sufficient cash on hand and working capital, including available\nborrowings on loans, to operate for a period of at least one year from the date the condensed financial statements are issued or available to be issued, which is referred to as the\nlook-forward period as defined by Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\nAs part of this assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to us, we will consider various scenarios, forecasts, projections, estimates and will\nmake certain key assumptions, including the timing and nature of projected cash expenditures or programs, and its ability to delay or curtail expenditures or programs, if\nnecessary, among other factors. Based on this assessment, as necessary or applicable, we make certain assumptions around implementing curtailments or delays in the nature\nand timing of programs and expenditures to the extent we deem probable those implementations can be achieved, and we have the proper authority to execute them within the\nlook-forward period in accordance with ASU No. 2014-15.\nBased upon the above assessment, we concluded that, at the date of filing the condensed financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the six months\nended June 30, 2024, we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next 12 months without additional funds.\n6\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense using a fair-value based method for all stock-based payments including stock options and restricted stock awards and stock issued\nunder an employee stock purchase plan. These standards require companies to estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option\npricing model. See Note 2. Stock Plans for a discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nOur investment policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations. We select investments that maximize interest income to the\nextent possible given these two constraints. We satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and\nlimit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit-quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The\nestimated fair values have been determined using available market information. We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.\nAll investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents. We had no money market funds as of June 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, included in our cash and cash equivalents.\nWe maintain significant cash balances at financial institutions which throughout the year regularly exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a\nlack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRestricted Cash\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, we explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents\nand restricted cash, and include restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the\ncondensed statements of cash flows.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets consist primarily of prepaid insurance, prepaid rent, prepaid payroll and other expenses. Prepaid expenses are recorded at cost\nand are amortized over the periods benefited using the straight-line method. The Company reviews prepaid expenses at each balance sheet date and adjusts the carrying\namounts as necessary to reflect the remaining estimated benefit.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three to five years.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue principally from collaborative research and development arrangements and government grants.\n7\nGrant Revenue\nWe had contracts with National Institute on Drug Abuse or NIDA, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and\nother government-sponsored organizations for research and development related activities that provided for payments for reimbursed costs, which may have included overhead\nand general and administrative costs. We recognized revenue from these contracts as we performed services under these arrangements when the funding was committed.\nAssociated expenses were recognized when incurred as research and development expense. Revenues and related expenses are presented gross in the condensed statements of\noperations.\nReceivables\nThe following table presents the activity related to our receivables for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n(in thousands)\nBalance at January 1, 2024 $ 46\nDeductions (8)\nBalance at June 30, 2024 $ 38\nResearch and Development Costs and Related Accrual\nResearch and development expenses include internal and external costs. Internal costs include salaries and employment related expenses, facility costs, administrative\nexpenses and allocations of corporate costs. External expenses consist of costs associated with outsourced contract research organization activities, sponsored research studies,\nproduct registration, and investigator sponsored trials. Significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period.\nActual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions. Revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision\nbecome known.\nLeases\nWe determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the\nfuture lease payments at commencement date. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable, and therefore, we utilize our incremental\nborrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\nCertain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received.\nLease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis. Operating leases are recognized on our condensed balance sheets as right-of-use assets,\noperating lease liabilities current and operating lease liabilities non-current.\nThe operating lease expired on June 30, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere are no recent accounting pronouncements that will have a material impact on our condensed financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nFinancial instruments, including receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are carried at cost, and their fair values are approximated due to the short-term nature\nof these instruments.\n8\n2. Stock Plans\nThe following table summarizes option activity:\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average Aggregate\nExercise Remaining Intrinsic\nOptions Price Option Term Value\n(in thousands) per share (in years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 93 $ 73.46 8.35 $ -\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 93 72.76 7.55 -\nExercisable at June 30, 2024 93 72.76 7.55 -\nThe following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense recorded for awards under our stock option plans:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nResearch and development $ - $ 26 $ - $ 54\nSelling, general and administrative - 239 - 500\nTotal stock-based compensation $ - $ 265 $ - $ 554\nWe use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options. There were no options granted or shares awarded during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options.\n3. Net Loss Per Share\nThe table below presents common shares underlying stock options and warrants that are excluded from the calculation of the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding used for the calculation of diluted net loss per common share. These are excluded from the calculation due to their anti-dilutive effect:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nWeighted-average anti-dilutive common shares resulting from options 93 47 93 46\nWeighted-average anti-dilutive common shares resulting from convertible note - - 8 -\nWeighted-average anti-dilutive common shares resulting from convertible preferred 380 - 355 -\nWeighted-average anti-dilutive common shares resulting from warrants 476 369 476 338\n949 416 932 384\n9\n4. Commitments and Contingencies\nLease Commitments\nWe leased our office facility under an operating lease that expired in June 2024. Rent expense associated with this lease was approximately $32,000 for the three months\nended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and $64,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn 2020, a legal proceeding was initiated against us by a former employee alleging wrongful termination, retaliation, infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision,\nhiring and retention and slander. An independent investigation into this individual’s allegations of whistleblower retaliation, while still an employee, was conducted utilizing an\noutside investigator and concluded that such allegations were not substantiated. In September 2023, Fedson, as consideration for the Asset Purchase Agreement, agreed to\nassume all liabilities related to this pending employment claim (see Note 5. Asset Sale).\n5. Asset Sale\nIn July 2023, we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Fedson for the sale of the ProNeura Assets, with closing occurring on September 1, 2023. The ProNeura\nAssets constituted only a portion of our assets. In August 2023, we entered into an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Fedson agreed to purchase\nour ProNeura Assets for a purchase price of $2.0 million, consisting of (i) $500,000 in readily available funds, paid in full on the Closing Date, (ii) $500,000 in the form of the\nCash Note and (iii) $1,000,000 in the form of the Escrow Note. We will also be eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $50 million on future net sales of the\nproducts and certain royalties on future net sales of the products. As further consideration, Fedson assumed all liabilities related to a pending employment claim against us. On\nthe Closing Date, Fedson delivered a written guaranty by a principal of Fedson of all of Fedson’s obligations under both the Cash Note and Escrow Note. The Cash Note\nincluded provisions, which Fedson has exercised, allowing Fedson to extend the maturity date of the Cash Note to November 1, 2023 and again to December 1, 2023 upon\npayment of $5,000 for each extension. The Cash Note and Escrow Note were paid in December 2023 and January 2024, respectively. We received the funds from the escrow\naccount in February 2024.\n6. Stockholders’ Equity\nOur common stock outstanding was 914,234 and 781,503 as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nReverse Split\nOn January 8, 2024, pursuant to prior stockholder authorization, our Board effected a reverse split of the outstanding shares of our common stock at a ratio of one share for\nevery twenty shares then outstanding (the “Reverse Split”). Pursuant to their respective terms, the number of shares underlying our outstanding options and warrants was\nreduced and their respective exercise prices increased by the Reverse Split ratio. The number of shares of common stock authorized and the par value of $0.001 per share did\nnot change as a result of the Reverse Split. All share and per share amounts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q give retroactive effect to the Reverse Split.\nChoong Choon Hau Note Conversion\nIn August 2023, we received $500,000 in funding in exchange for the issuance of a convertible promissory note for that principal amount to Choong Choon Hau (the “Hau\nPromissory Note”). Pursuant to the Hau Promissory Note, the principal amount accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum and is payable monthly. All principal and accrued\ninterest was due and payable on January 8, 2024, unless extended as provided. All or part of the Hau Promissory Note could be converted into our common stock at a\nconversion price of $9.32 per share from time to time following the issuance date and ending on the maturity date. In March 2024, the Hau Promissory Note, along with\naccrued interest of approximately $4,511, was converted into 54,132 shares of our common stock.\n10\n7. Related Party Transactions\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we made payments related to legal and consulting fees of approximately $9,225 and approximately $75,000,\nrespectively, to a law firm operated by one of our Board members.\nIn August 2023, we received $500,000 in funding in exchange for the issuance of the Hau Promissory Note. In March 2024, the Hau Promissory Note, along with accrued\ninterest of approximately $4,511, was converted into 54,132 shares of our common stock (see Note 6. Stockholders’ Equity).\n8. Subsequent Events\nThe Company performed a review of events subsequent from the condensed balance sheet date through the date the condensed financial statements were issued and\ndetermined that there were no events requiring recognition or disclosure in the condensed financial statements.\n11\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in the documents incorporated by reference herein may contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A\nof the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) that involve substantial risks and\nuncertainties. We have attempted to identify forward-looking statements by terminology including “anticipates,” “believes,” “can,” “continue,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,”\n“intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “should,” or “will” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Although we do not make forward\nlooking statements unless we believe we have a reasonable basis for doing so, we cannot guarantee their accuracy. Forward-looking statements included or incorporated by\nreference in this report or our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, include, but are not necessarily limited to, those relating to uncertainties\nrelating to:\n● Our ability to complete one or more strategic transactions that will maximize our assets or otherwise provide value to stockholders;\n● our ability to raise capital when needed;\n● difficulties or delays in the product development and regulatory process; and\n● protection for our patents and other intellectual property or trade secrets.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which,\nthat performance or those results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time they are made and/or management’s good faith\nbelief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks outlined under “Risk Factors” or elsewhere in this report, that\ncould cause actual performance or results to differ materially from what is expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made.

We assume no obligation to\nupdate forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent\nrequired by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect\nto those or other forward-looking statements. We caution you not to give undue weight to such projections, assumptions and estimates.\nReferences herein to “we,” “us,” “Titan,” and “our company” refer to Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. unless the context otherwise requires.\nProbuphine® and ProNeura® are trademarks of Fedson, Inc. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q also includes trade names and trademarks of other companies besides\nTitan.\nAll share and per share data in this report gives retroactive effect to a 1-for-20 reverse stock split effected on January 9, 2024.\nOverview\nWe are a pharmaceutical company that was previously developing therapeutics utilizing the proprietary long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura®, for the treatment of\nselect chronic diseases for which steady state delivery of a drug has the potential to provide an efficacy and/or safety benefit. ProNeura consists of a small, solid implant made\nfrom a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate (“EVA”) and a drug substance. The resulting product is a solid matrix that is designed to be administered subdermally in a brief,\noutpatient procedure and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period.\n12\nOur first product based on the ProNeura technology was Probuphine® (buprenorphine implant), which is approved in the United States, Canada and the European Union\n(“EU”) for the maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder in clinically stable patients taking 8 mg or less a day of oral buprenorphine. While Probuphine continues to be\ncommercialized in the EU (as Sixmo™) by another company that had acquired the rights from Titan, we discontinued commercialization of the product in the United States\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020 and subsequently sold the product in September 2023. Discontinuation of our commercial operations has allowed us to focus our limited\nresources on important product development programs and transition back to a product development company.\nIn December 2021, we announced our intention to work with our financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, potentially including an\nacquisition, merger, reverse merger, other business combination, sales of assets, licensing or other transaction. In June 2022, we implemented a plan to reduce expenses and\nconserve capital that included a company-wide reduction in salaries and a scale back of certain operating expenses to enable us to maintain sufficient resources as we pursued\npotential strategic alternatives. In July 2022, David Lazar and Activist Investing LLC (collectively, “Activist”) acquired an approximately 25% ownership interest in Titan, filed\na proxy statement and nominated six additional directors, each of whom was elected to our board of directors (the “Board”) at a special meeting of stockholders held on\nAugust 15, 2022 (the “Special Meeting”). The exploration and evaluation of possible strategic alternatives by the Board has continued following the Special Meeting.\nFollowing the election of the new directors at the Special Meeting, Dr. Marc Rubin was replaced as our Executive Chairman, and David Lazar assumed the role of Chief\nExecutive Officer. In connection with the termination of his employment as Executive Chairman, Dr. Rubin received aggregate severance payments of approximately $0.4\nmillion. In December 2022, we implemented additional cost reduction measures including a reduction in our workforce. In June 2023, David Lazar sold his approximately 25%\nownership interest in Titan to Choong Choon Hau. Mr. Lazar resigned his position as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer in April 2024. Our Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors, Seow Gim Shen, assumed the position as our Chief Executive Officer in April 2024.\nIn April 2024, David Lazar, our Chief Executive Officer, Kate Beebe DeVarney, Ph.D., our President and Chief Operating Officer and a member of our Board of Directors,\nand three other members of our Board of Directors, Eric Greenberg, Matthew C. McMurdo and David Natan, resigned their positions with the Company. Pursuant to the terms\nof their respective settlement agreements, we made payments in aggregate of approximately $1.2 million. The Board of Directors subsequently appointed Firdauz Edmin Bin\nMokhtar and Francisco Osvaldo Flores García as independent directors of the Company to fill two of the vacancies created by the resignations. In addition, Dato Seow Gim\nShen was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer and will continue to serve as the Company’s Chairman of the Board, which he has done since\nOctober 12, 2023.\nOn September 1, 2023, (the “Closing Date”), we closed on the sale of certain ProNeura assets, including our portfolio of drug addiction products, in addition to other early\ndevelopment programs based on the ProNeura drug delivery technology (the “ProNeura Assets”). In July 2023, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset\nPurchase Agreement”) with Fedson, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Fedson”) for the sale of the ProNeura Assets. Our addiction portfolio consisted of the Probuphine and\nNalmefene implant programs. The ProNeura Assets constituted only a portion of our assets. In August 2023, we entered into an Amendment and Extension Agreement (the\n“Amendment”) to the Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Fedson agreed to purchase our ProNeura Assets for a purchase price of $2.0 million, consisting of (i)\n$500,000 in readily available funds, paid in full on the Closing Date, (ii) $500,000 in the form of a promissory note due and payable on October 1, 2023 (the “Cash Note”) and\n(iii) $1,000,000 in the form of a promissory note due and payable on January 1, 2024 (the “Escrow Note”). We will also be eligible to receive potential milestone payments of\nup to $50 million on future net sales of the products and certain royalties on future net sales of the products. As further consideration, Fedson assumed all liabilities related to a\npending employment claim against us. On the Closing Date, Fedson delivered a written guaranty by a principal of Fedson of all of Fedson’s obligations under both the Cash\nNote and Escrow Note. The Cash Note included provisions, which Fedson has exercised, allowing Fedson to extend the payment of the Cash Note to November 1, 2023 and\nagain to December 1, 2023 upon payment of $5,000 for each extension. The Cash Note and Escrow Note were paid in December 2023 and January 2024, respectively. We\nreceived the funds from the escrow account in February 2024.\nWe operate in only one business segment, the development of pharmaceutical products. We make available free of charge through our website, www.titanpharm.com, our\nperiodic reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on recent accounting pronouncements.\n13\nResults of Operations for the Three and Six Months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023\nRevenues\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenues:\nLicense revenue $ - $ 1 $ (1) $ - $ 1 $ (1)\nGrant revenue - 82 (82) - 180 (180)\nTotal revenues $ - $ 83 $ (83) $ - $ 181 $ (181)\nThe decrease in total revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the completion of activities related to development grants in February\n2024.\nOperating Expenses\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ - $ 442 $ (442) $ - $ 1,003 $ (1,003)\nGeneral and administrative 2,074 1,229 845 3,137 2,463 674\nTotal operating expenses $ 2,074 $ 1,671 $ 403 $ 3,137 $ 3,466 $ (329)\nThe decrease in research and development costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily associated with the completion of activities related to our\ndevelopment grants, decreases in expenses related to initial non-clinical proof of concept studies related to our TP-2021 implant program and decreases in research and\ndevelopment personnel-related costs and other expenses. Other research and development expenses include internal operating costs such as research and development\npersonnel-related expenses, non-clinical and clinical product development related travel expenses, and allocation of facility and corporate costs. As a result of the risks and\nuncertainties inherently associated with pharmaceutical research and development activities described elsewhere in this document, we are unable to estimate the specific timing\nand future costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily related to increases in severance expenses and board\npayments offset by decreases in non-cash stock based compensation.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income (expense), net $ - $ 7 $ (7) $ 1 $ 29 $ (28)\nOther expense, net (19) (5) (14) (17) (5) (12)\nOther income (expense), net $ (19) $ 2 $ (21) $ (16) $ 24 $ (40)\nThe decrease in other income (expense), net for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was primarily due to decreases in interest income and non-income tax related\nexpenses.\n14\nNet Loss and Net Loss per Share\nOur net loss from operations for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 was approximately $2.1 million, or approximately $2.29 per share, compared to our net loss\nfrom operations of approximately $1.6 million, or approximately $2.11 per share, for the comparable period in 2023. Our net loss from operations for the six-month period\nended June 30, 2024 was approximately $3.2 million, or approximately $3.57 per share, compared to our net loss from operations of approximately $3.3 million, or\napproximately $4.34 per share, for the comparable period in 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through the sale of our securities and the issuance of debt, as well as with proceeds from warrant and option\nexercises, corporate licensing and collaborative agreements, and government-sponsored research grants. At June 30, 2024, we had a working capital of approximately $4.0\nmillion compared to working capital of approximately $6.6 million at December 31, 2023.\nIn September 2023, we entered into a purchase agreement with Sire Group, pursuant to which we agreed to issue 950,000 shares of our Series AA Convertible Preferred\nStock at a price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $9.5 million. The purchase price consisted of (i) $5.0 million in cash at closing and (ii) $4.5 million in\nthe form of a promissory note from Sire Group which was paid in September 2023. The net cash proceeds from this transaction were approximately $9.5 million.\nIn September 2023, we closed on the sale of the ProNeura Assets pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement with Fedson. The ProNeura Assets constituted only a portion\nof our assets. In August 2023, we entered into an Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Fedson agreed to purchase our ProNeura Assets for a\npurchase price of $2.0 million, consisting of (i) $500,000 in readily available funds, paid in full on the Closing Date, (ii) $500,000 in the form of the Cash Note and (iii)\n$1,000,000 in the form of the Escrow Note. We will also be eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $50 million on future net sales of the products and certain\nroyalties on future net sales of the products. As further consideration, Fedson assumed all liabilities related to a pending employment claim against us. On the Closing Date,\nFedson delivered a written guaranty by a principal of Fedson of all of Fedson’s obligations under both the Cash Note and Escrow Note. The Cash Note included provisions,\nwhich Fedson has exercised, allowing Fedson to extend the payment of the Cash Note to November 1, 2023 and again to December 1, 2023 upon payment of $5,000 for each\nextension. The Cash Note and Escrow Note were paid in December 2023 and January 2024, respectively. We received the funds from the escrow account in February 2024.\nIn August 2023, we received $500,000 in funding in exchange for the issuance of a convertible promissory note for that principal amount to Choong Choon Hau (the “Hau\nPromissory Note”). Pursuant to the Hau Promissory Note, the principal amount will accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum and will be payable monthly. All principal and\naccrued interest shall be due and payable on January 8, 2024, unless extended as provided. All or part of the Hau Promissory Note could be converted into our common stock at\na conversion price of $9.32 per share from time to time following the issuance date and ending on the maturity date. In March 2024, the Hau Promissory Note, along with\naccrued interest, was converted into 54,132 shares of our common stock.\nAt June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.1 million, which we believe is sufficient to fund our planned operations through the third quarter\nof 2025. We are exploring several financing and strategic alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nSix months Ended\nJune 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (2,681) $ (3,011)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,681) $ (3,011)\nNet cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 consisted primarily of our net loss of approximately $3.2 million, offset by approximately $0.5\nmillion related to net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 consisted primarily of our net loss\nof approximately $3.3 million, approximately $0.4 million related to net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by approximately $0.6 million of non-cash\ncharges primarily related to stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization.\n15\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur market risk disclosures set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 have not materially changed.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: Our principal executive and financial officers reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our principal\nexecutive and financial officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the timely provision of material information relating to Titan, as\nrequired to be disclosed in the reports we file under the Exchange Act due to the identification of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described\nbelow.\nNotwithstanding the conclusion by principal executive and financial officers that the disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were\nnot effective and the material weakness identified in internal controls over financial reporting described below, management believes that the consolidated financial statements\nand related financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP).\n(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and\neffected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and\n(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control\nover financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management overrides. Due to such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements\nmay not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting\nprocess. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting for Titan.\nManagement has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control—Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework), known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of Titan’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment,\nmanagement has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n16\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material\nmisstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management identified a deficiency in our internal control\nover financial reporting that gave rise to a material weakness. The deficiency was primarily related to limited finance and accounting staffing levels not commensurate with our\ncomplexity and our financial accounting and reporting requirements. We underwent organizational changes in 2023 and 2022, including multiple reductions in workforce and\noperate with a very lean finance and accounting department. This limited staffing resulted in a lack of resources to fully monitor and operate our internal controls over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, resulting in a deficiency being discovered during our annual auditing process.\nManagement discovered a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting which resulted in the misclassification of issuance costs of approximately\n$0.4 million related to the issuance of preferred stock during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nRemediation Activities\nManagement continues to evaluate the material weakness discussed above, has created a remediation plan that it has already begun implementing and continues to finalize\nthat plan’s implementation. For example, we will be hiring a new Chief Financial Officer to oversee our controls environment and continue to utilize a Sarbanes-Oxley\ncompliance firm to assist in testing and implementing additional controls and procedures in our finance and accounting department. We have corrected the deficiency\ndiscovered during our annual audit process prior to the filing of the annual report. However, assurance as to when all remediation efforts will be complete cannot be provided\nand the material weakness cannot be considered remedied until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through\ntesting, that these controls are operating effectively. Management cannot provide assurances that the measures that have been taken to date, and are continuing to be\nimplemented, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness identified or to avoid potential future material weaknesses.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: Other than with respect to the ongoing remediation efforts described above, there were no other changes in our\ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and a non-accelerated filer, and therefore our independent registered public accounting firm has not issued a report on the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting.\n17\nPART II. Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nIn September 2023, Fedson, as further consideration for the Asset Purchase Agreement, agreed to assume all liabilities related to a pending employment claim initiated by a\nformer employee alleging wrongful termination, retaliation, infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, hiring and retention and slander. See Note 4. Commitments\nand Contingencies.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2023 10-K, which\ncould materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our 2023 10-K are not the only risks facing our company. Except as noted\nbelow, the risks and uncertainties described in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” have not materially changed. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we\ncurrently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nIn August 2023, we received $500,000 in funding in exchange for the issuance of a convertible promissory note for that principal amount to Choong Choon Hau (the “Hau\nPromissory Note”). Pursuant to the Hau Promissory Note, the principal amount accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum and is payable monthly. All principal and accrued\ninterest was due and payable on January 8, 2024, unless extended as provided. All or part of the Hau Promissory Note could be converted into our common stock at a\nconversion price of $9.32 per share from time to time following the issuance date and ending on the maturity date.\nOn March 18, 2024, we issued 54,132 shares of our common stock to Mr. Hau in connection with the conversion of the $500,000 unpaid principal amount and accrued\ninterest of the Hau Promissory Note. Pursuant to the terms of the Hau Promissory Note, Mr. Hau was permitted to convert the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest\nthereof into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $9.32 per share at any time following the issuance date of August 8, 2023. Following the conversion of the\nConvertible Note, Mr. Hau owns approximately 241,531 shares of our common stock, or approximately 26.4% of the shares outstanding.\nThe issuance of common stock was made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”),\nprovided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nNone of our directors or executive officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the six months\nended June 30, 2024, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) or Regulation S-K.\n18\nItem 6.
