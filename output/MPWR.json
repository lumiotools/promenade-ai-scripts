Business\nGeneral\nMonolithic Power Systems, Inc. (“MPS”) is a fabless global company that provides high-performance,\nsemiconductor-based power electronics solutions. Incorporated in 1997, our three core strengths include deep\nsystem-level knowledge, strong semiconductor design expertise, and innovative proprietary technologies in the\nareas of semiconductor processes, system integration, and packaging. These combined advantages enable us to\ndeliver reliable, compact, and monolithic solutions found in storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive,\nindustrial, communications and consumer applications. Our mission is to reduce energy and material consumption\nto improve all aspects of quality of life and create a sustainable future. We believe that we differentiate ourselves\nby offering solutions that are more highly integrated, smaller in size, more energy-efficient, more accurate with\nrespect to performance specifications and, consequently, more cost-effective than many competing solutions.\nWe plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in new innovative\nproduct categories.\nOur principal executive office is located in Kirkland, Washington. We have over 3,500 employees worldwide,\nwith locations in Asia (primarily in China, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), Europe (primarily\nin France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and the United States.\nIndustry Overview\nSemiconductors comprise the basic building blocks of electronic systems and equipment. Within the semiconductor\nindustry, components can be classified either as discrete devices, such as individual transistors or integrated\ncircuits (“ICs”), in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated\nelectronic circuit. ICs can be further divided into three primary categories: digital, analog, and mixed-signal.\nDigital ICs, such as memory devices and microprocessors, can store or perform arithmetic functions on data\nthat is represented by a series of ones and zeroes. Analog ICs, in contrast, handle real world signals such as\ntemperature, pressure, light, sound, or speed. In addition, analog ICs also perform power management functions,\nsuch as regulating or converting voltages, for electronic devices. Mixed-signal ICs combine digital and analog\nfunctions onto a single chip and play an important role in bridging real world to digital systems.\nAnalog and Mixed-Signal Markets. We focus on the market for high performance analog and mixed-signal\nICs. High performance products generally are differentiated by functionality and performance factors, which\ninclude integration of higher levels of functionality onto a single chip, greater precision, better power efficiency\nand density, higher speed and lower heat and noise. There are several key factors that distinguish the analog and\nmixed-signal IC markets from digital IC markets. These factors include longer product life cycles, numerous\nmarket segments, technology that is difficult to replicate, relative complexity of design and process technologies,\nimportance of experienced design engineers, lower capital requirements and diversity of end markets. We\nhave targeted product and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above-average growth over the\nlong term compared to the semiconductor industry as a whole.\n1\nEnd Markets and Applications\nWe design and develop our products for the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial,\ncommunications and consumer markets, with the storage and computing market representing the largest portion\nof our revenue in 2023. The following table is a summary of the various end market applications for our products,\nand those markets’ contribution as a percentage of our total revenue:\nPercentage of Total Revenue\nEnd Markets Applications 2023 2022 2021\n• Storage and • Storage applications, commercial notebooks, 27.0% 25.3% 21.2%\ncomputing and graphics cards\n• Automotive • Advanced driver assistance systems, 21.7% 16.7% 16.9%\ninfotainment, digital cockpit, USB\nconnectors, body electronics, and\nlighting applications\n• Enterprise Data • Cloud-based CPU server applications, 17.7% 14.0% 9.6%\nand server artificial intelligence\n(“AI”) applications\n• Consumer • Home appliances, gaming, smart TVs, 12.9% 17.8% 23.4%\nlighting, monitors, and stereos\n• Communications • 4G and 5G infrastructure, satellite 11.3% 14.0% 13.6%\ncommunications, and other\nwireless applications\n• Industrial • Power sources, industrial meter, security 9.4% 12.2% 15.3%\napplications, and other industrial equipment\nProduct Families\nOur proprietary process and packaging technologies enable us to design and deliver smaller, single-chip power\nmanagement ICs. These technologies simplify the design process and are applicable across a wide range of\nanalog applications within the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications\nand consumer markets. Our product families are differentiated from those of our competitors with respect to\ntheir high degree of integration and strong levels of accuracy, power efficiency, quality and longevity, making\nthem cost-effective and more sustainable relative to many competing solutions. Our key product families include\nthe following:\nDirect Current (“DC”) to DC Products. DC to DC ICs are used to convert and control voltages within a broad range\nof electronic systems, such as cloud-based CPU servers, server AI applications, storage applications, commercial\nnotebooks, digital cockpit, power sources, home appliances, 4G and 5G infrastructure and satellite communications\napplications. We believe that our DC to DC products are differentiated in the market, particularly with respect to\ntheir high degree of integration, high voltage operation, high load current, high switching speed, small footprint,\nand high energy efficiency. These features are important to our customers as they are designed to result in fewer\ncomponents that need to be produced and consumed, a smaller form factor, more accurate regulation of voltages,\nlower power consumption and, ultimately, lower system cost, increased reliability and lower carbon emissions\nthrough the elimination of many discrete components and power devices. The DC to DC product family accounted\nfor 94% of our total revenue in 2023 and 95% of our total revenue in both 2022 and 2021.\nLighting Control Products. Lighting control ICs are used in backlighting and general illumination products.\nLighting control ICs for backlighting are used in systems that provide the light source for LCD panels typically\nfound in computers and notebooks, monitors, car navigation systems and televisions. Backlighting solutions\nare typically either white light emitting diode lighting sources or cold cathode fluorescent lamps. The Lighting\nControl product family accounted for 6% of our total revenue in 2023 and 5% of our total revenue in both 2022\nand 2021.\n2\nIn the future, we plan to continue to introduce new products within our existing product families, as well as in\nnew innovative product categories. Our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in part upon our ability to\ncontinue to innovate while fulfilling our customers’ evolving needs, enter new market segments, obtain design\nwins, grow our sales to customers in regions outside China, Taiwan and other Asian markets, expand our customer\nbase and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.\nCustomers, Sales and Marketing\nWe have sales offices in China, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States and throughout\nEurope. Our products typically require a highly technical sales and applications engineering effort where we\nassist our customers in the design and use of our products in their application. We maintain a staff of applications\nengineers who work directly with our customers’ engineers in the development of their systems’ electronics\ncontaining our products.\nOnce we secure our product positioning through our technical sales and applications engineers’ efforts, we\nthen sell our products through third-party distributors, value-added resellers and directly to original equipment\nmanufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”), electronic manufacturing service (“EMS”)\nproviders and other end customers. Our third-party distributors are subject to distribution agreements with us,\nwhich allow the distributors to sell our products to end customers and other resellers, including OEMs, ODMs\nor EMS providers. Our value-added resellers may second source our products and provide other services to\ncustomers. ODMs typically design and manufacture electronic products on behalf of OEMs, and EMS providers\ntypically provide manufacturing services for OEMs and other electronic product suppliers.\nIn 2023, our three largest distributors accounted for 26%, 19% and 10% of our total revenue. In 2022, our two\nlargest distributors accounted for 24% and 19% of our total revenue. In 2021, our three largest distributors\naccounted for 26%, 15% and 10% of our total revenue. No other distributors or end customers accounted for\nmore than 10% of our full-year, total revenue in any of the periods presented.\nCurrent distribution agreements with several of our major distributors provide that each distributor has the non-\nexclusive right to sell and shall use its best efforts to promote and develop a market for our products. These\nagreements provide that payment for purchases from us will generally occur within 30 to 90 days from the date\nof invoice. In addition, we allow for limited stock rotation in certain agreements.\nBecause our sales are primarily billed and payable in United States dollars, our sales are generally not subject\nto fluctuating currency exchange rates. However, because a majority of our revenue is attributable to sales to\ncustomers in Asia, changes in the relative value of the dollar may create pricing pressures for our products. In\n2023, 2022 and 2021, our revenue from sales to customers in Asia was 87%, 86% and 90%, respectively.\nOur sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders\nthat we have received from customers which have not yet shipped. Because orders in backlog are subject to\ncancellation or postponement, and backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of actual sales\nfor any succeeding period, we believe that our backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue.\nTypical supply chain lead times for orders are generally 16 to 26 weeks. We often build inventory in advance\nbased on our forecast of future customer orders. This subjects us to certain risks, most notably the possibility that\nsales will not meet our forecast, which could lead to inventories in excess of demand. If excess inventory exists, it\nmay be necessary for us to sell it at a substantial discount, take a significant write-down or dispose of it altogether,\nall of which would negatively affect our profit margins. In addition, in response to market conditions, we may\nslow the rate of manufacturing our products, which could result in insufficient inventory levels and reduced sales\nif we underestimate the demand for our products.\n3\nResearch and Development\nWe have assembled a qualified team of engineers primarily in China, the United States, Taiwan, Spain, Switzerland,\nHungary, Portugal and Germany with core competencies in analog and mixed-signal design. Through our research\nand development efforts, we have developed a collection of intellectual property and know-how that we are able\nto leverage across our products and markets. These include the development of high efficiency power devices,\nthe design of precision analog circuits and systems, expertise in mixed-signal design, and integration and the\ndevelopment of proprietary semiconductor process technologies.\nOur research and development efforts are generally targeted at three areas: systems architecture, circuit design\nand implementation, and process technologies. In the area of systems architecture, we are exploring new ways of\nsolving our customers’ system design challenges and are investing in the development of systems expertise in new\nmarkets and applications that align well with our core capabilities. In the area of circuit design and implementation,\nour initiatives include expanding our portfolio of products and adding new features to our products. In the area\nof process technologies, we are investing in research and development resources to provide leading-edge analog\npower processes for our next generation of ICs. We believe process technologies are key strategic components to\nour future growth.\nOur growth is fueled by our customers’ need for our power-efficient solutions. Consequently, we focus on\ncontinually improving the energy efficiency of our products in our research and development efforts in all\nthree targeted areas. Our products are principally positioned to achieve lower power loss and enable significant\nreductions in circuit board space by shrinking or eliminating many passive components that are otherwise needed\nby competitors’ offerings. In addition, the life cycles of our products are typically over 10 years, reducing the\nmanufacturing needs and associated carbon emissions associated with the production of replacement products.\nPatents and Intellectual Property Matters\nWe rely on our proprietary technologies, which include both our proprietary circuit designs for our products and\nour proprietary manufacturing process technologies. Our future success and competitive position depend in part\nupon our ability to obtain and maintain protection of our proprietary technologies.\nIn general, we have elected to pursue patent protection for aspects of our circuit and device designs that we believe\nare patentable and to protect our manufacturing process technologies by maintaining those process technologies\nas trade secrets. As of December 31, 2023, we had 1,701 patents/applications issued or pending, of which\n585 patents have been issued in the United States. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times\nthrough December 2043. Our patents are material to our business, but we do not rely on any one particular patent\nfor our success. We also rely on a combination of nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions,\nas well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and loyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and\nprocesses. We also seek to register certain of our trademarks as we deem appropriate. We have not registered any\nof our copyrights and do not believe registration of copyrights is material to our business. Despite precautions\nthat we take, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technology\nor products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. There can be no assurance that the\nsteps we take are adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents,\nthat others will not develop or patent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be\nchallenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products\nare or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to\nthe same extent as laws in the United States. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could\nmaterially harm our business.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent\nand other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in\nour industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation\nmay be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves against\ninfringement claims. Such litigation can be very costly and may divert our management resources. Further, we\nhave agreed to indemnify certain of our customers and suppliers in some circumstances against liability from\n4\ninfringement by our products. In the event any third party were to make an infringement claim against us or our\ncustomers, we could be enjoined from selling selected products, could be required to indemnify our customers or\nsuppliers, or could pay royalties or other damages to third parties. If any of our products are found to infringe and\nwe are unable to obtain necessary licenses or other rights on acceptable terms, we would either have to change\nour product so that it does not infringe or stop making the infringing product, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nManufacturing\nWe utilize a fabless business model, working with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ICs. This fabless\napproach allows us to focus our engineering and design resources on our strengths and to reduce our fixed costs\nand capital expenditures. In contrast to many fabless semiconductor companies, which utilize standard process\ntechnologies and design rules established by their foundry partners, we have developed our own proprietary\nprocess and packaging technologies and collaborate with our foundry partners to install our technologies on their\nequipment in their facilities for use on our behalf. This close collaboration and control over the manufacturing\nprocess has historically resulted in favorable yields and product performance for our ICs.\nWe currently contract with several suppliers to manufacture our wafers in foundries located in China, Taiwan,\nSouth Korea and Singapore. Once our silicon wafers have been produced, they are shipped to the facilities in\nChina, Taiwan, and Singapore that we and our partners utilize for wafer sort, which is a testing process performed\nto identify non-functioning dies. Our semiconductor products are then assembled and packaged by independent\nsubcontractors in China, Taiwan and Malaysia. The assembled ICs are then sent for final testing to the facilities in\nChina, Taiwan and Malaysia that we and our partners utilize prior to shipping to our customers.\nThe manufacturing facilities we utilize in Asia enable us to benefit from shorter manufacturing cycle times and\nlower labor and overhead costs. We have expanded our product testing capabilities in these facilities and are\nable to take advantage of the rich pool of local engineering talent to expand our manufacturing support and\nengineering operations.\nCompetition\nThe analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures\nto continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue\nto recruit both applications engineering and design engineering personnel, our ability to introduce new products,\nand our ability to maintain the rate at which we introduce these new products, and our ability to meet our and\ncustomers’ energy efficiency goals. Our industry is characterized by decreasing average selling prices over the\nlife of a product. We compete with domestic and international semiconductor companies, many of which have\nsubstantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing,\nand distribution of their products and, in some cases, have a broader number of product offerings that may enable\nthem to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and active\ncompetition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with several manufacturers of such products, of\nvarying size and financial strength. We consider our primary competitors to include Analog Devices, Infineon\nTechnologies, NXP Semiconductors, ON Semiconductor, Power Integrations, Renesas Electronics, ROHM\nSemiconductor, Semtech, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments.\nWe expect continued competition from existing competitors as well as competition from new entrants into the\nsemiconductor market. We believe that we are competitive in the markets in which we sell and on the basis of key\ncompetitive factors in our industry, particularly because our ICs typically are smaller in size, are highly integrated with\nlower energy consumption, possess higher levels of power management functionalities and achieve high performance\nspecifications at lower price points than most of our competitors. However, there is no assurance that our products will\ncontinue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products\nand enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering our markets. In addition, there has\nrecently been a high level of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. If these or future acquisitions are successful,\ncompetition may intensify and our competitors may have additional resources to compete against us.\n5\nWe operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry. While we are subject to industry downturns, we have targeted\nproduct and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the\nlong term.\nHistorically, our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half although\nvarious factors, such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions, could impact this trend.\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to international, federal and local legislation, regulations, and other requirements relating to the\ndischarge of substances into the environment; the treatment, transport, and disposal of hazardous wastes; recycling\nand product packaging; worker health and safety; and other activities affecting the environment, our workforce,\nand the management of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our operations and facilities comply in all\nmaterial respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws.\nWe are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the\ncountries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. Government regulations and import/export\ncontrols can be complex and are subject to change in the future, and accordingly, we are unable to assess the\npossible effect of compliance with future requirements. Our efforts to comply with these government regulations\ncould have material impacts on our capital expenditures and operating expenses, revenue, resource allocation,\noperations, competitive position, or financial condition, though the magnitude and duration of such impacts are\nuncertain and difficult to quantify. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of material risks related\nto government policies and regulations on environmental laws, international trade policies and restrictions,\nincluding tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting the export of goods and services between\nthe U.S. and China.\nHuman Capital Management\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees.\nDue to the relative complexity of the design of our analog and mixed-signal ICs, our engineers generally have\nmany years of experience and greater circuit design aptitude. Analog engineers with advanced skills are limited in\nnumber and difficult to replace. The loss of the services of key officers, managers, engineers and other technical\npersonnel would materially harm our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, train,\nretain, and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel, and there can be no assurance we will\nbe successful.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 3,564 employees primarily in Asia, Europe, South America and the\nUnited States, compared with 3,247 employees as of December 31, 2022. Certain employees are subject to\ncollective bargaining agreements and we believe that we have good relations with these employees. We have\nnever experienced an employee-based work stoppage or strike.\nWe strive to maintain a culture that encourages innovation and create a workplace that values diverse backgrounds,\na healthy and safe environment, and professional growth opportunities.\n• We continue to recruit new talent from a diverse candidate pool through various university recruitment\nprograms and employment websites targeting underrepresented groups. We provide unconscious bias\ntraining to promote an environment of inclusivity. We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind and have\nadopted policies for reporting concerns or violations.\n• We are an equal-opportunity employer, and we make employment decisions based on merit and business\nneeds. Our total compensation packages are competitive, fair, and structured to encourage employees to\ninvest in our future.\n• We provide employees with access to various learning tools and resources to explore their interests and\ndevelop their business skills and knowledge.\n6\n• We have occupational health and safety management systems and environmental management plans\nin place. They include our standards for chemical and hazardous waste management, rules on use of\npersonal protective equipment, and safety training plans. Our largest testing facilities in Chengdu, China\nare ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certified.\n• We support the well-being of our employees. In certain offices, we offer onsite flu shot clinics and other\nannual health checkups and workshops. Our largest facilities have amenities including fitness centers,\nsports courts and private rooms for nursing. We also offer free exercise classes, strength training and\nyoga in some of our offices.\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to those reports that are filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge.

Risk Factors\nOur business involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the material risks described\nbelow. This section should be read in conjunction with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K and our other filings with the SEC. If any of these risks materialize from time to time, then our business,\nreputation, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your\ninvestment in our common stock. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties may arise that could also harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects.\nOur past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors\nshould not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. These risks involve forward-looking\nstatements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following summary description sets forth an overview of the material risks we are exposed to in the normal\ncourse of our business activities. The summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by\nreference to the full risk factor discussion immediately following this summary description. We encourage you to\nread the full risk factor discussion carefully.\nOur revenue and expenses are difficult to predict, have varied significantly in the past, and could fluctuate\nsignificantly in the future due to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. As a\nresult, we may not be profitable on a quarterly or annual basis. Our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, as well as your investment in our common stock, could be materially and adversely affected by any of\nthe following material risks:\n• our dependence on the markets in Asia for our customer base, which may expose us to political, cultural,\nregulatory, economic, foreign currency and operational risks;\n• changes in general economic conditions in the countries where our products are sold or used, particularly\nthose in China;\n• the impact of extensive Chinese government regulations, reduction or elimination of incentives, and\nuncertainties with respect to China’s legal system, on us and our manufacturing partners and suppliers;\n• changes in international trade policy, such as tariffs on imports of foreign goods and regulations restricting\nthe export of goods and services, between the U.S. and China;\n• political and other risks in Taiwan and Hong Kong due to their tense relationships with China;\n• fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other currencies, including the Renminbi;\n8\n• our reliance on key suppliers in China, which may expose us to political, cultural, regulatory, economic,\nforeign currency, operational and capacity shortage risks;\n• our ability to achieve growth rates or financial performance comparable to past years;\n• changes in general demand for electronic products in the end markets that we serve;\n• our ability to accurately forecast sales and expenses due to the nature of our business as a\ncomponent supplier;\n• our ability to timely develop and introduce new products, and the acceptance of our new products in\nthe marketplace;\n• our dependency on a limited number of customers, including distributors and value-added resellers, for\na significant portion of our revenue;\n• potential product liability risks due to defects or failures to meet specifications;\n• lengthy sales cycles for our products balanced against the fixed nature of a substantial portion of\nour expenses;\n• availability of adequate manufacturing capacity from our suppliers, and our ability to increase product\nsales in spite of capacity issues;\n• increases in unanticipated costs as a result of increasing manufacturing capacity;\n• our dependency on third-party suppliers for wafer purchases and potential increases in prices for wafers\ndue to general capacity shortages;\n• our ability to deliver products on a timely basis despite disruptions in our relationships with assembly\nand test subcontractors;\n• our ability to manage our inventory levels, including the levels of inventory held by our distributors;\n• increases in manufacturing costs due to commodity price increases;\n• the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, and increased competition due to\nindustry consolidation;\n• competition from companies with greater financial and technological resources, and customers\ndeveloping products internally;\n• the impact of system upgrades, cyberattacks or other system security, data protection and privacy\nbreaches on our business operations;\n• the impact of various U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data protection on our\nbusiness operations;\n• our significant investment of resources in research and development that may not result in increased\nfuture sales;\n• our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any business acquisitions and other strategic investments;\n• the impact of new tax laws on our tax provision and tax planning;\n• risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting and the identified material weakness;\n• our failure to comply with various governmental laws and regulations related to environmental, social\nand governance (“ESG”) initiatives or our failure to meet our own ESG goals and targets;\n9\n• our ability to successfully defend ourselves in legal proceedings and protect our intellectual property,\nand the significant increase in legal expenses as a result of such proceedings;\n• the loss of key personnel;\n• risks associated with owning our stock, including volatility in our trading price due to our business and\nfinancial performance, analyst downgrades, failure to meet our own or analyst expectations, changes to\nour stock repurchase or dividend program, and dilution from issuance of additional shares;\n• health risks, climate crises and other natural disasters; and\n• financial market, economy and geopolitical uncertainties.\nRisks Associated with Our Significant Operations in Asia, Particularly in China\nWe derive most of our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers in Asia and have significant operations\nin Asia, which may expose us to political, cultural, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange, and operational risks.\nWe derive most of our revenue from customers located in Asia through direct sales or indirect sales under\ndistribution arrangements and value-added reseller agreements with parties located in Asia. As a result, we are\nsubject to significant risks due to this geographic concentration of business and operations. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 87% of our revenue was from customers in Asia. There are risks inherent in doing business\nin Asia, and internationally in general, including:\n• changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements or restrictions, including tax\nand trade laws in the U.S. and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products, and\ngovernmental action to restrict our ability to sell to foreign customers where sales of products may\nrequire export licenses;\n• trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. related to goods imported from regions in China with records of\nforced labor and other human rights issues;\n• currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting intercompany transactions;\n• fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies, which could affect the\ncompetitiveness of our products;\n• transportation delays and other supply chain issues;\n• changes in tax regulations in China that may impact our tax status in Chengdu, Hangzhou and other\nregions where we have significant operations;\n• multi-tiered distribution channels that may diminish visibility to end customer pricing and\npurchase patterns;\n• international political relationships and acts or threats of war;\n• terrorism and threats of terrorism;\n• adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters that may cause work stoppages and affect our\noperations in China;\n• work stoppages related to employee dissatisfaction;\n• economic, social and political instability;\n• longer accounts receivable collection cycles;\n10\n• enforcing contracts generally; and\n• less effective protection of intellectual property and contractual arrangements.\nIf we fail to expand our customer base and significantly reduce the geographic concentration of our customers,\nwe will continue to be subject to the foregoing risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur business has been and may be significantly impacted by worldwide economic conditions, in particular\nchanging economic conditions in China.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on global economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic\nconditions, including inflation, slowing growth, recession, stagflation, new or increased tariffs and other barriers\nto trade, tighter credit, higher interest rates, currency fluctuations, higher unemployment, labor shortages, lower\ncapital expenditures by businesses, and lower consumer confidence and spending, have in the past, and could in\nthe future, have a material adverse effect on logistics, demand for our products, and our product and operational\ncosts. For example, due to economic uncertainties in 2023, some of our customers cancelled, decreased or delayed\ntheir existing and future orders with us, which impacted our financial results and made our forecasting much more\ndifficult. In addition, volatility in the credit markets could severely diminish our customers’ liquidity and capital\navailability, which could materially harm our business.\nDemand for our products is a function of the health of the economies in the U.S., Europe, China and the rest of\nAsia. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic disruptions, such as those resulting from\nthe global economic downturn, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Middle East conflict or subsequent economic\nrecovery worldwide, in our industry, or in the different markets that we serve. We also may not accurately\nassess the impact of changing market and economic conditions on our business and operations. These and other\neconomic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition\nand operating results.\nIn particular, since we have significant operations in China, our business development plans, results of operations\nand financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by significant political, social and economic\ndevelopments in China. The current stagnation in China’s economy has adversely impacted, and could further\nadversely impact our customers, prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and partners in China, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThere are inherent risks associated with the operation of our manufacturing and testing facilities in China,\nwhich could increase product costs or cause a delay in product shipments.\nWe have manufacturing and testing facilities in China. We face the following risks, among others, with respect to\nour operations in China:\n• challenges to hire and maintain a qualified workforce;\n• natural disasters such as earthquakes, flooding, severe heatwaves or droughts, which could result in\npower shortages or water restrictions in our facilities;\n• challenges to maintain appropriate and acceptable manufacturing controls; and\n• higher than anticipated overhead and other operational costs.\nIf we are unable to maintain our facilities in China at full operational status with qualified workers, appropriate\nmanufacturing controls and reasonable cost levels, we may incur costs higher than our current expense levels,\nwhich would affect our gross margins and operating expenses. In addition, if capacity restraints result in significant\ndelays in product shipments, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\n11\nWe and many of our manufacturing partners and suppliers are subject to extensive Chinese government\nregulations, and the benefit of various incentives from Chinese governments that we and many of our\nmanufacturing partners and suppliers receive may be reduced or eliminated, which could increase our costs or\nlimit our ability to sell products and conduct activities in China.\nThe Chinese government has broad discretion and authority to regulate the technology industry in China.\nAdditionally, the Chinese government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic activities\nin China. It exercises significant control over China’s economy through the allocation of resources, controlling\npayment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential\ntreatment to particular industries or companies.\nAny additional regulations or the amendment of previously implemented regulations could require us and our\nmanufacturing partners and suppliers to change our business plans, increase our costs, or limit our ability to sell\nproducts and conduct business activities in China, which could materially and adversely affect our business and\noperating results.\nThe Chinese government and provincial and local governments have also provided, and may continue to provide,\nvarious incentives to encourage the development of the semiconductor industry in China. Such incentives include\ncash awards, tax rebates, reduced tax rates, favorable lending policies and other measures, some or all of which\nmay be available to our manufacturing partners, suppliers and us. Any of these incentives could be reduced or\neliminated by governmental authorities at any time, which could materially and adversely affect our business and\noperating results.\nUncertainties with respect to China’s legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws,\nand sudden or unexpected changes in policies, laws and regulations in China could materially and adversely\naffect our operations.\nChina’s legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court\ndecisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since China’s\nlegal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations and enforcement of these laws and regulations are\nnot always uniform and involve uncertainties. In addition, any new or amended laws and regulations related to,\namong other things, foreign investments and manufacturing could have a material adverse effect on our business\nand our ability to operate business in China.\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights.\nAny administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion\nof resources and management attention. Since China’s administrative and court authorities have significant\ndiscretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult\nto evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection than those that\nmay be provided in other jurisdictions. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce contracts in China\nand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, China’s legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which\nare not published on a timely basis, or at all, and may have retroactive effects. As a result, we may not be aware\nof our violation of any of these policies and rules until some time after the violation may have occurred. Such\nunpredictability towards our contractual, property and procedural rights and any failure to quickly respond to\nchanges in the regulatory environment in China could materially and adversely affect our business and impede\nour ability to continue our operations and proceed with our business plans in China.\nWe are subject to export laws, trade policies and restrictions including international tariffs that could materially\nand adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that could limit and restrict the export of some of our products\nand services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other individuals,\nincluding, in certain cases, dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances,\n12\nexport controls and economic sanctions may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies,\nand in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations has not materially limited our operations or our sales, but could in\nthe future, which would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. We maintain an\nexport compliance program, but our compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities,\nsanctions and restrictions on our business. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by\nother countries affecting trade and investments. Although these restrictions and laws have not materially restricted\nour operations in the past, they could do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business\nand results of operations. In addition, U.S. laws and regulations and sanctions, or threat of sanctions, that could\nlimit or restrict the export of some of our products and services may also encourage our customers to develop\ntheir own solutions to replace our products, or seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products\nfrom our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our customers’ end products and systems\nthat incorporate our components could be subject to export laws, trade policies and other sales restrictions, which\ncould indirectly affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. For example, the increasing\nfocus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target\nproducts and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions\nimpacting the sales of AI technologies or products. Any of such regulatory restrictions could, in turn, impact the\nsales of our products supporting AI applications.\nThere has been increasing rhetoric, in some cases coupled with legislative or executive action, from several U.S.\nand foreign leaders regarding tariffs against foreign imports of certain materials. More specifically, there have\nbeen several rounds of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods that have taken effect in the past few years, some of which\nprompted retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. The institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the\nU.S. and China specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting both countries’ overall economic condition, as\nwell as our business and financial results. If these tariffs continue or additional tariffs are imposed in the future,\nthey could have a negative impact on us as we have significant operations in China and the U.S.\nAdditionally, the imposition of tariffs is dependent upon the classification of goods under the U.S. Harmonized\nTariff System (“HTS”) and the country of origin of the goods. Determination of the HTS and the origin of the\ngoods is a technical matter that can be subjective in nature. Accordingly, although we believe our classifications\nof both HTS and origin are appropriate, there is no certainty that our assessment will be consistent with that of\nthe U.S. government. If the U.S. government does not agree with our determinations, we could be required to pay\nadditional amounts, including potential penalties.\nWe face political and other risks conducting business in Taiwan and Hong Kong, particularly due to their tense\nrelationships with China.\nWe have significant business operations in Taiwan, and many of our manufacturing partners and suppliers are\nlocated in Taiwan. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be affected\nby changes in governmental and economic policies in Taiwan, social instability and diplomatic and social\ndevelopments in or affecting Taiwan due to its unique international political status. Although Taiwan and China\nhave significant economic and cultural relations, we cannot assure that relations between Taiwan and China will\nnot face political, military or economic challenges or actions in the future. Any deterioration in the relations\nbetween Taiwan and China, and other factors affecting military, political or economic conditions in Taiwan, could\ndisrupt our business operations and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, the Chinese government has promulgated new regulations impacting economic and political stability\nwithin Hong Kong where many of our customers are located. Due to the sensitive political climate these regulations\ncreated, there are increasing risks that this China’s national security law may trigger sanctions or other forms of\nrestrictions by foreign governments including the U.S., which could affect companies conducting business in\nHong Kong. It is difficult for us to predict the impact, if any, the implementation of the national security law will\nhave on our business, as such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot\nbe predicted.\n13\nFluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to other foreign currencies, including the Renminbi, may\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nMany of our manufacturing and other suppliers are and will continue to be primarily located in China for the\nforeseeable future. In connection with the global economic downturn, there has been an increased level of global\ncurrency fluctuation and volatility. If the value of the Renminbi rises against the U.S. Dollar, there could be an\nincrease in our manufacturing costs relative to competitors who have manufacturing facilities located outside\nChina, which could adversely affect our financial results and operations. In addition, our sales are primarily\ndenominated in the U.S. Dollar. If the value of the U.S. Dollar rises against other currencies, it may adversely\naffect the demand for our products in international markets, which could negatively and materially impact our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nWe incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain transactions, including intercompany\ntransactions between the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries, that are denominated in currencies other than the\nfunctional currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the\namount of foreign currency exchange losses we record, which could have an adverse and material impact on our\nresults of operations.\nA significant portion of our manufacturing capacity comes from suppliers in China, which exposes us to\npolitical, cultural, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange, and operational risks.\nA significant portion of our manufacturing, assembly and packaging capacity comes from key suppliers located in\nChina. As a result, we are subject to significant political, regulatory, economic, foreign exchange, and operational\nrisks due to this geographic concentration in our business. Although our management has an established long-\nterm strategy to diversify capacity outside China, there is no guarantee that we will be able to identify, qualify and\nengage additional foundry partners and assembly and packaging suppliers in other regions in order to mitigate\nthese risks, or that the quality, price or terms of such production will be sufficient or acceptable to us, any of which\ncould negatively and materially harm our business and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Product Demand and Sales\nWe may not achieve growth rates or financial performance comparable to past years.\nIn the past, our revenue increased significantly in certain years due to increased sales of certain of our products.\nWe are subject to numerous risks and factors that could cause a decrease in our growth rates, or a decline in\nrevenue compared to past periods, including increased competition, loss of certain of our customers, unfavorable\nchanges in our operations, reduced global electronics demand, a deterioration in market conditions including as\na result of the global economic downturn, end-customer market downturn, market acceptance and penetration\nof our current and future products, and litigation. A decrease in our growth rates, or a decline in revenue, could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf demand for our products declines in the major end markets that we serve, our revenue will decrease and our\nresults of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that the application of our products in the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive,\nindustrial, communication and consumer markets will continue to account for the majority of our revenue. If we\nare not able to accurately predict new end markets to serve or if the demand for our products declines in certain\nof our current major end markets, our revenue would decrease compared to prior year periods and our results of\noperations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, as technology evolves,\nthe requirement to integrate the functionalities of various components, including our discrete semiconductor\nproducts, onto a single chip and/or onto other components of systems containing our products increases. Should\nour customers require integrated solutions that we do not offer, demand for our products could decrease, and our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\n14\nDue to the nature of our business as a component supplier, we may have difficulty both in accurately predicting\nour future revenue and appropriately managing our expenses.\nBecause we provide components for end products and systems, demand for our products is influenced by our\ncustomers’ end product demand. As a result, we may have difficulty in accurately forecasting our revenue and\nexpenses. Our expenses and revenue depend on the timing, size, and speed of commercial introductions of end\nproducts and systems that incorporate our products, all of which are inherently difficult to forecast, as well as\nthe ongoing demand for previously introduced end products and systems. In addition, demand for our products is\ninfluenced by our customers’ ability to manage their inventory. Our sales to distributors are also subject to higher\nvolatility because they service demand from multiple levels of the supply chain which, in itself, is inherently\ndifficult to forecast. All of these factors continue to be exacerbated by the adverse effects of macroeconomic factors,\nincluding inflation, increased interest rates, supply chain disruptions, decreased economic output, fluctuations in\ncurrency rates, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Middle East conflict. If our customers, including distributors,\nreduce their orders from us, do not manage their inventory correctly or misjudge their customers’ demand, our\nshipments to and orders from our customers may vary significantly or decline on a quarterly basis, and we may\nhave difficulty forecasting our expenses and inventory levels, which could reduce our revenue, result in inventory\nwrite offs, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products with margins similar to, or better than, what\nwe have experienced in the past, which could impact our overall gross margin and financial performance.\nOur success depends on our development and sale of products that are differentiated in the market, with gross\nmargins that have historically been above industry averages. Should we fail to improve or maintain our gross\nmargins in the future, and accordingly develop and introduce sufficiently differentiated products that result in\nhigher gross margins than industry averages, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products or in penetrating new markets required to\nmaintain or expand our business.\nOur competitiveness and future success depend on our ability to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test,\nmarket, and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. A fundamental shift\nin technologies in any of our product markets could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position\nwithin these markets. Our failure to timely develop new technologies or to react quickly to changes in existing\ntechnologies could materially delay our development of new products, which could result in product obsolescence,\ndecreased revenue, and/or a loss of market share to competitors.\nAs we develop new product lines, we must adapt to market conditions that may be unfamiliar to us, such as\ncompetitors and distribution channels that are different from those we have known in the past. Some of our new\nproduct lines require us to re-equip our labs to test parameters we have not tested in the past. If we are unable to\nadapt rapidly to these new conditions, we may not be able to successfully penetrate new markets.\nThe success of a new product depends on accurate forecasts of long-term market demand and future technological\ndevelopments, as well as on a variety of other factors, including:\n• timely and efficient completion of process design and device structure improvements;\n• timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing, assembly, and test processes;\n• the ability to secure and effectively utilize fabrication capacity in different geometries;\n• product performance;\n• product availability and pricing;\n• product quality and reliability; and\n• effective marketing, sales and services.\n15\nTo the extent that we fail to timely introduce new products or to quickly penetrate new markets, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue from distribution arrangements and value-added resellers,\nand the loss of any one of these distributors, value-added resellers or direct customers, or failure to collect a\nreceivable from them could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe market our products through distribution arrangements and value-added resellers, and through our direct\nsales to customers that include OEMs, ODMs and EMS providers. Receivables from our customers are generally\nnot secured by any type of collateral and are subject to the risk of being uncollectible. Significant deterioration\nin the liquidity or financial condition of any such major customers or any group of our customers could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future financial condition and\noperating results. While we could partner with other distributors or value-added resellers to replace any of our\ncustomers, the change in business partners could interrupt our operations, cause us to have to identify and qualify\nnew partners, and have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, we believe a high percentage of our products are eventually sold to a number of OEMs and ODMs.\nAlthough we communicate with OEMs and/or ODMs in an attempt to achieve “design wins,” which are decisions\nby OEMs and/or ODMs to incorporate our products, we do not have purchase commitments from these end\nusers. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the OEMs and/or ODMs will continue to incorporate our ICs\ninto their products, even if we secure a design win. OEM technical specifications and requirements can change\nrapidly, and we may not have products that fit new specifications from an end customer for whom we have had\nprevious design wins. We cannot be certain that we will continue to achieve design wins from large OEMs, that\nour customers will continue to be successful in selling to the OEMs, or that the OEMs will be successful in selling\nproducts which incorporate our ICs. The loss of any significant customer, any material reduction in orders by any\nof our significant customers or by their OEM customers, the cancellation of a significant customer order, or the\ncancellation or delay of a customer’s or an OEM’s significant program or product could reduce our revenue and\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products must meet specifications, and undetected defects and failures may occur, which may cause\ncustomers to return or stop buying our products and may expose us to product liability risk.\nOur customers generally establish demanding specifications for quality, performance, energy efficiency and\nreliability that our products must meet. ICs as complex as ours often encounter development delays and may\ncontain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or after commencement of commercial shipments,\nwhich might require product replacement or recall. Further, our third-party manufacturing processes or changes\nthereto, or changes in the materials used in the manufacturing processes may cause our products to fail. From time\nto time, we have experienced product quality, performance or reliability problems. Our standard warranty period\nis generally one or two years, which exposes us to significant risks of claims for defects and failures. If defects and\nfailures occur in our products, we could experience a loss of customers and/or a decrease in revenue, increased\ncosts, including warranty expense and costs associated with customer support, cancellations or rescheduling of\norders or shipments, and product returns or discounts, any of which would harm our operating results.\nIn addition, product liability claims may be asserted by our customers. Although we currently have insurance, there\ncan be no assurance that we have obtained sufficient insurance coverage or that asserted claims will be within the\nscope of coverage. Our insurance providers could deny or challenge these claims, and as a result, reimbursement\nto us is not guaranteed or could be delayed. If coverage is denied, we may not have sufficient resources to pay for\nthese claims. Furthermore, we may experience a significant increase in premiums and therefore decide to self-\ninsure, which may not meet the expectations or requirements of certain customers. All of these factors could have\na material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n16\nBecause of the lengthy sales cycles for our products and the fixed nature of a significant portion of our\nexpenses, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue and may not ultimately achieve\nour forecasted sales for our products.\nThe introduction of new products presents significant business challenges because product development plans and\nexpenditures may be made up to two years or more in advance of any sales. It generally takes us up to 12 months\nor more to design and manufacture a new product prototype. Only after we have a prototype do we introduce the\nproduct to the market and begin selling efforts in an attempt to achieve design wins. This sales process requires\nus to expend significant sales and marketing resources without any assurance of success. Volume production of\nproducts that use our ICs, if any, may not be achieved for an additional period of time after an initial sale. Sales\ncycles for our products are lengthy for a number of reasons, including:\n• our customers usually complete an in-depth technical evaluation of our products before they place a\npurchase order;\n• the commercial adoption of our products by OEMs and ODMs is typically limited during the initial\nrelease of their product to evaluate product performance and consumer demand;\n• our products must be designed into our customers’ products or systems; and\n• the development and commercial introduction of our customers’ products incorporating new technologies\nare frequently delayed.\nAs a result of our lengthy sales cycles, we may incur substantial expenses before we earn associated revenue\nbecause a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue. The\nlengthy sales cycles of our products also make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult. In addition,\nthe delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks that customers may cancel or change their orders,\nparticularly as such customers are exposed to economic risks in connection with the global economic downturn.\nOur sales are made by purchase orders. Because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders\non relatively short notice, backlog is not always a good indicator of our future sales. If customer cancellations or\npurchase order changes occur, we could lose anticipated sales and not have sufficient time to reduce our inventory\nand operating expenses.\nRisks Associated with Supply and Manufacturing\nOur ability to increase product sales and revenue may be constrained by the manufacturing capacity of\nour suppliers.\nAlthough we provide our suppliers with rolling forecasts of our production requirements, their ability to provide\nwafers to us is limited by the available capacity, particularly capacity in the geometries we require, at the facilities\nin which they manufacture wafers for us. As a result, this lack of capacity has at times constrained our product\nsales and revenue growth. In addition, an increased need for capacity to meet internal demands or demands of\nother customers could cause our suppliers to reduce capacity available to us. Our suppliers may also require us\nto pay amounts in excess of contracted or anticipated amounts for wafer deliveries or require us to make other\nconcessions in order to acquire the wafer supply necessary to meet our customer requirements. If our suppliers\nextend lead times, limit supplies or the types of capacity we require, or increase prices due to capacity constraints\nor other factors, our revenue and gross margin may materially decline. In addition, if we experience supply delays\nor limitations, our customers may reduce their purchase levels with us and/or seek alternative solutions to meet\ntheir demand, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n17\nThere may be unanticipated costs associated with increasing our third-party suppliers’ manufacturing capacity.\nWe anticipate that future growth of our business will require increased manufacturing capacity on the part of\nthird-party supply foundries, assembly shops, and testing facilities for our products. In order to facilitate such\ngrowth, we may need to enter into strategic transactions, investments and other activities, with both our current\nsuppliers and new suppliers. Such activities are subject to a number of risks, including:\n• the costs and expense associated with such activities, including requirements to make long-term purchase\ncommitments including upfront cash deposits to our suppliers;\n• the availability of modern foundries to be developed, acquired, leased or otherwise made available to us\nor our third-party suppliers;\n• the ability of foundries and our third-party suppliers to obtain the advanced equipment used in the\nproduction of our products;\n• delays in identifying and negotiating agreements with new foundries and suppliers; and\n• environmental, engineering or manufacturing qualification problems relating to existing or new foundry\nfacilities, including delays in qualification of new foundries by our customers.\nThese and other risks may affect the ultimate cost and timing of any expansion of our third-party supplier\ncapacity. If our manufacturing costs increase, including as a result of inflationary pressure, or we experience\nsupply constraints, we may be required to raise the prices of our products to remain profitable, which could result\nin a loss of customers. If we are unable to increase or maintain our manufacturing capacity, we may be unable to\nmeet demand, which would harm our revenue and results of operations and may result in a loss of customers as\nthey seek supply from other sources.\nWe currently depend on third-party suppliers to provide us with wafers for our products. If any of our wafer\nsuppliers are acquired, become insolvent or capacity constrained, or are otherwise unable to provide us\nsufficient wafers at acceptable yields or at anticipated costs, our revenue and gross margin may decline or we\nmay not be able to fulfill our customer orders.\nWe have supply arrangements with certain suppliers for the production of wafers. Should any of our suppliers be\nacquired or become insolvent or capacity constrained, we may not be able to fulfill our customer orders, which\nwould likely cause a decline in our revenue.\nWhile certain aspects of our relationships with these suppliers are contractual, many important aspects of our\nrelationships depend on our suppliers’ continued cooperation and our management of such relationships with the\nsuppliers. Our relationships could be negatively impacted by changes in control or changes in the management\nteam of the suppliers. In addition, the fabrication of ICs is a highly complex and precise process. Problems in the\nfabrication process can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous ICs on each wafer to\nbe non-functional. This could potentially reduce yields and supply of our products. The failure of our suppliers to\nprovide wafers at acceptable yields could prevent us from fulfilling our customer orders and would likely cause\na decline in our revenue.\nIn addition, adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflationary pressures resulting from worldwide supply\nchain constraints and other factors, have increased, and may continue to increase, the prices we pay to our\nsuppliers. As a result of the increased costs, we have raised, and may be required to further raise the prices of our\nproducts in order to remain profitable, which could result in a loss of customers and reduced revenue.\nFurther, as is common in the semiconductor industry, our customers may reschedule or cancel orders on relatively\nshort notice. If our customers cancel orders after we submit a committed forecast to our suppliers for the\ncorresponding wafers, we may be required to purchase wafers that we may not be able to resell, which would\nadversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n18\nWe might not be able to deliver our products on a timely basis if our relationships with our assembly and test\nsubcontractors are disrupted or terminated.\nWe do not have direct control over product delivery schedules or product quality because all of our products\nare assembled by third-party subcontractors and a portion of our testing is currently performed by third-party\nsubcontractors. Also, due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assembly and test subcontractors,\nwe could experience delays in the shipment of our products if we were forced to find alternate third parties to\nassemble or test our products. In addition, events such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Middle East conflict\nand supply chain disruptions may materially impact our assembly suppliers’ ability to operate. Any future product\ndelivery delays or disruptions in our relationships with our subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products, and if demand is not as\nexpected, we may have insufficient or excess inventory, which could adversely impact our financial position.\nAs a fabless semiconductor company, we purchase our inventory from third-party manufacturers. We place\norders with our manufacturers based on existing and expected orders from our customers for particular products.\nWhile most of our contracts with our customers and distributors include lead time requirements and cancellation\npenalties that are designed to protect us from misalignment between customer orders and inventory levels, we\nmust nonetheless make some predictions when we place orders with our manufacturers. Some of our customers\nand distributors may nevertheless cancel orders as a result of the impacts of the global economic downturn, their\nown specific business challenges or for other reasons. In the event that our predictions are inaccurate due to\nunexpected increases in orders or unavailability of products within the timeframe that is required, we may have\ninsufficient inventory to meet our customers’ demands. In addition, a negative trend in market conditions could\nlead us to decrease the manufacturing volume of our products to avoid excess inventory. If we inaccurately assess\nmarket conditions for our products, we would have insufficient inventory to meet our customer demands resulting\nin lost potential revenue. In the event that we order products that we are unable to sell due to a decrease in orders,\nunexpected order cancellations, injunctions due to patent litigation, import/export restrictions or product returns,\nwe may have excess inventory which, if not sold, may need to be written down or would result in a decrease in\nour revenue in future periods as the excess inventory at our distributors is sold. If any of these situations were to\narise, it could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price and availability of commodities (e.g., gold, copper and silicon) may adversely impact our ability to\ndeliver our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and may adversely affect our business and results\nof operations.\nOur products incorporate commodities such as gold, copper and silicon. An increase in the price or a decrease in\nthe availability of these commodities and similar commodities that we use could negatively impact our business\nand results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Industry Dynamics and Competition\nThe highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which has resulted in significant and sometimes\nprolonged downturns, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical and, at various times, has experienced significant\ndownturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand. These conditions have caused significant variances in\nproduct demand and production capacity, as well as rapid erosion of average selling prices, which have resulted,\nand could in the future result, in lower demand for our products, downward pressure on the price of our products,\nand/or increased inventory due to our customers’ delayed production schedule. Because significant portions of\nour expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated sales, we may not be able to decrease\nour expenses in a timely manner to offset any sales shortfall. Any significant or prolonged downturns would have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n19\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\nIn recent years, there has been a trend toward semiconductor industry consolidation. We expect this trend to\ncontinue as companies attempt to improve the leverage of growing research and development costs, strengthen\nor hold their market positions in an evolving industry, or become unable to continue operations unless they find\nan acquirer or consolidate with another company. In addition, companies that are strategic alliance partners in\nsome areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business\nwith us. We believe that semiconductor industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better\nable to compete as sole-source suppliers of multiple products for customers. This could lead to more variability\nin our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nWe compete against many companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, and our market\nshare may be reduced if we are unable to respond to our competitors effectively.\nThe analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures\nto continue. Our ability to compete effectively and to expand our business will depend on our ability to continue\nto recruit application engineers and design talent, introduce new products, and maintain the rate at which we\nintroduce these new products. We compete with domestic and foreign semiconductor companies, many of\nwhich have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing,\nmarketing, and distribution of their products, and, in some cases, may have a broader number of product offerings\nthat enable them to more effectively market and sell to customers and engage sales partners. We are in direct and\nactive competition, with respect to one or more of our product lines, with many manufacturers of varying size\nand financial strength. The number of our competitors has grown due to the expansion of the market segments in\nwhich we participate.\nWe cannot guarantee that our products will continue to compete favorably, or that we will be successful in the\nface of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new\ncompanies entering this market, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our\nfinancial condition.\nIn addition, from time to time, governments may provide subsidies or make other investments that could give\ncompetitive advantages to many semiconductor companies. For example, in August 2022, the U.S. enacted the\nCHIPS Act, which, among other things, provides funding to increase domestic production and research and\ndevelopment in the semiconductor industry. Because we operate a fabless business model, we were not eligible\nfor such investments. Many of our competitors benefitted from the investments, which will help increase their\nproduction capacities, shorten their lead times and gain market share. These competitive pressures could materially\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face competition from customers developing products internally.\nOur customers generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources. Some customers\nhave traditionally used these resources to develop their own products internally. The future prospects for our\nproducts in these markets are dependent in part upon our customers’ acceptance of our products as an alternative\nto their internally developed products. Future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third-party\nsourcing for products as an alternative to in-house development. Customers may continue to increase their use\nof internally developed components. They may also decide to develop or acquire components, technologies or\nproducts that are similar to, or that may be substituted for, our products. If any of these situations were to occur,\nour business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n20\nRisks Associated with IT and Cybersecurity\nImplementation of enhanced enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) or other IT systems could result in\nsignificant disruptions to our operations.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new ERP software solutions or upgrade existing systems. Implementation\nof these solutions and systems is highly dependent on coordination of system providers and internal business\nteams. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including\nsystem downtime causing interruptions in business operations. In addition, transitioning to these new systems may\nrequire significant capital investments and personnel resources. Difficulties in implementing new or upgraded\ninformation systems or any significant system failures could disrupt our operations and financial reporting, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain software we use is from open-source code sources, which, under certain circumstances, may lead to\nunintended consequences and, therefore, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,\noperating results and cash flow.\nWe use open-source software in connection with certain of our products and services, and we intend to continue\nto use open-source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of\nopen-source software against companies that incorporate open-source software into their products or services or\nalleging that these companies have violated the terms of an open-source license. As a result, we could be subject\nto lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or alleging that we have\nviolated the terms of an open-source license. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on\nour operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources\nto change our solutions. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software solutions with open-source\nsoftware in certain circumstances, we could, under certain open-source licenses, be required to publicly release\nthe source code of our proprietary software solutions, which could harm our business and ability to compete. If\nwe inappropriately use open-source software, we may be required to re-engineer our solutions, discontinue the\nsale of our solutions, release the source code of our proprietary software to the public at no cost or take other\nremedial actions, which could increase our costs, harm our ability to compete and have a material adverse effect\non our business, operating results and financial condition. There is also a risk that open-source licenses could be\nconstrued in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our\nsolutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSystem security risks, data protection or privacy breaches, cyberattacks, systems integration issues and\nunauthorized use of AI tools could disrupt our internal operations and/or harm our reputation, and any such\ndisruption or harm could cause a reduction in our expected revenue, increase our expenses, negatively impact\nour results of operation or otherwise adversely affect our stock price.\nExperienced hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our\nconfidential and proprietary information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. As AI capabilities\nimprove, threat actors may quickly develop more sophisticated and convincing attacks. These attacks could be\ncrafted with an AI tool to directly attack information systems with increased speed and efficiency or create more\neffective phishing emails. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses,\nworms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address\nthese problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may impede our sales,\nmanufacturing, distribution, financial reporting or other critical functions.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we store sensitive data on our internal systems, network and servers, such\nas proprietary business and financial information, and confidential data pertaining to our customers, suppliers\nand business partners. Maintaining security of sensitive information on our networks and the protection features\nof our solutions are both critical to our operations and business strategy. We devote significant resources to\nnetwork security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data. However, these\nsecurity measures cannot provide absolute security. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security\n21\nand integrity of our systems and solutions, any destructive or intrusive breach could compromise our networks,\ncreating system disruptions or slowdowns, and the information stored on our networks could be accessed,\npublicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Remote working arrangements, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Middle East\nconflict, and AI-powered cybersecurity threats have also heightened our potential exposure to cyberattacks, which\ncould put the sensitive data we store on our internal systems at risk. If any of these types of security breaches\nwere to occur and we were unable to protect sensitive data, our reputation and relationships with our business\npartners and customers could be materially harmed, and we could be exposed to risks of litigation and possible\nsignificant liability.\nPortions of our IT infrastructure may also experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce\nerrors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not\nbe successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and\nour remediation efforts may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions\ncould adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders in a timely manner and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales\nor a loss of customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results and reputation.\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, any personal information maintained by us or on our behalf,\nwhether through breach of our systems, breach of the systems of our suppliers by an unauthorized party, or\nthrough employee error, theft or misuse, or otherwise, could harm our business. If any such unauthorized use or\ndisclosure of, or access to, such personal information was to occur, our operations could be seriously disrupted,\nand we could be subject to demands, claims and litigation by private parties, and investigations and penalties by\nregulatory authorities. In addition, we could incur significant costs in notifying affected individuals and entities\nand otherwise complying with the multitude of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating\nto the unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, personal information. Finally, any perceived or actual\nunauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, such information could harm our reputation and substantially\nimpair our ability to attract and retain customers, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur ability to manage and aggregate data may be limited by the effectiveness of our policies, programs, processes,\nsystems and practices that govern how data is acquired, validated, used, stored, protected, processed and shared.\nFailure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability\nto manage current and emerging risks, as well as to manage changing business needs. While we restrict the use of\nthird-party and open-source AI tools, such as ChatGPT, our employees and consultants may use these tools on an\nunauthorized basis and our partners may use these tools, which poses additional risks relating to the protection of\ndata, including the potential exposure of our proprietary confidential information to unauthorized recipients and\nthe misuse of our or third-party intellectual property. Use of AI tools may result in allegations or claims against\nus related to violation of third-party intellectual property rights, unauthorized access to or use of proprietary\ninformation and failure to comply with open-source software requirements. AI tools may also produce inaccurate\nresponses that could lead to errors in our decision-making, product development or other business activities,\nwhich could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our ability to\nmitigate these risks will depend on our continued effective maintaining, training, monitoring and enforcement\nof appropriate policies and procedures governing the use of AI tools, and the results of any such use, by us or\nour partners.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international laws, policies and other regulations regarding data protection.\nPrivacy, cyber security, and data protection are becoming increasingly significant issues. To address these issues,\nthe Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the Cyber Security Law of the People’s\nRepublic of China (the “Cyber Security Law”), which took effect on June 1, 2017. The Cyber Security Law sets\nforth various requirements relating to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of data, among other\nthings. On June 10, 2021, the National People’s Congress passed the Data Security Law of the People’s Republic\nof China (the “Data Security Law”), which became effective on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law is the\nfirst comprehensive data security legislation in China, which becomes a key supplement to the Cyber Security\nLaw and aims to regulate a wide range of issues in relation to the collection, storage, processing, use, provision,\n22\ntransaction and publication of any kind of data. Various Chinese agencies are expected to issue additional\nregulations in the future to define these requirements more precisely. For example, the Personal Information\nProtection Law (“PIPL”), took effect on November 1, 2021. PIPL is aimed at protecting and controlling the\nuse and transfer of personal data in China. There is significant uncertainty in how regulators will interpret and\nenforce the law, and it contains provisions that allow substantial government oversight and include fines for\nfailure to obtain required approval from China’s cyber and data protection regulators for cross-border transfers\nof personal data.\nEffective May 25, 2018, the European Union (“EU”) implemented the General Data Protection Regulation\n(“GDPR”), a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of EU data protection law to non-European\nUnion entities that process, or control the processing of, the personal data of EU subjects. The GDPR allows for\nthe imposition of fines and corrective action on entities that improperly use, disclose or secure the personal data of\nEU subjects, including through a data security breach. In addition, an increasing number of states in the U.S. have\nenacted laws containing similar requirements to the GDPR for businesses collecting or processing personal data.\nFor example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which was\nsignificantly amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and sets forth comprehensive privacy and security\nobligations regarding the collection and processing of personal data of eligible California residents. Other states\nhave, or are expected to, enact similar or more expansive legislation regarding the collection and processing of\npersonal data.\nThese regulatory requirements may increase our costs of compliance. Any failure to fully comply with the Cyber\nSecurity Law, the Data Security Law, PIPL, GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws and regulations could lead to\nsignificant fines and regulatory corrective actions, along with reputational damage or third-party lawsuits, which\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, data security breaches experienced by\nus could result in the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, public disclosure of sensitive commercial\ndata, and the exposure of personal data (including sensitive personal data) of our employees, customers, suppliers\nand others. Such incidents could subject us to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions and/\nor criminal prosecution, and cause us to lose customers and their related revenue in the future.\nRisks Associated with Strategic Investments and Initiatives\nOur success depends on our investment of significant resources in research and development. We may have\nto invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating\nexpenses and negatively impact our operating results.\nOur success depends on us investing significant amounts of resources in research and development. We expect to\ncontinue investing heavily in research and development in the future in order to keep innovating and introducing\nnew products in a timely manner and increase our revenue and profitability. Increased investments in research\nand development will increase our operating expenses, which may negatively impact our operating results, and\nwe may not achieve the return on these investments that we anticipate, or be able to reduce such expenses in a\ntimely manner if we experience a downturn in sales. Also, if we are unable to properly manage and effectively\nutilize our research and development resources, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial\ncondition and operating results.\nIn addition, if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or\nother competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and\ndevelopment efforts, our operating expenses would increase further. If we are required to invest significantly\ngreater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in\nrevenue, our operating results could be harmed. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than\nwe have and are able to invest substantially greater amounts into research and development initiatives than we are,\nwhich could harm our ability to innovate and compete. Research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate\nfrom time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these\ninvestments may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. In\n23\norder to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and\ndevelopment, and we expect these expenses to increase in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity\nand the greater number of products under development.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of any company or business that we acquire. In addition, acquisitions\ncould result in diluting the ownership interests of our stockholders, reduce our cash balances and/or cause us\nto incur debt or to assume contingent liabilities, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time we review acquisition prospects that would complement our\ncurrent product offerings, enhance our design capability or offer other competitive opportunities. As a result of\ncompleting acquisitions, we could use a significant portion of our available cash, cash equivalents and short-\nterm investments, issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership, or incur\nsubstantial debt or contingent liabilities. Such actions could impact our financial condition, operating results and\nthe price of our common stock.\nIn addition, we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for various reasons, including\ncompetition from other companies in the semiconductor industry, the valuation expectations of acquisition\ncandidates and applicable antitrust or other policies, laws or regulations. If we are unable to identify and complete\nacquisitions, we may not be able to successfully expand our business and product offerings.\nIn January 2024, we completed the acquisition of Axign B.V. (“Axign”), a fabless semiconductor company located\nin the Netherlands that specializes in the development of consumer audio applications. We cannot guarantee that\nthis or any future acquisitions will improve our results of operations or that we will otherwise realize the anticipated\nbenefits of any acquisitions. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in integrating Axign, or any acquired company or\nbusiness into our operations, or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptions\nthat could harm our business and result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. Some\nof the risks that may adversely affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits from the acquired\ncompanies, businesses or assets include those associated with:\n• unexpected losses of key employees or customers of the acquired companies or businesses;\n• integrating the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n• coordinating new product and process development;\n• hiring additional management and other critical personnel;\n• increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n• difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how;\n• difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products;\n• undisclosed liabilities of the acquired businesses and potential legal disputes with founders or stockholders\nof acquired companies;\n• our inability to commercialize acquired technologies;\n• the projected business potential is not realized and as a result, we may be required to take an impairment\ncharge related to goodwill or acquired intangibles that would impact our profitability;\n• difficulties in assessing the fair value of earn-out arrangements;\n• diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and\n• adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers.\n24\nAlternatively, third parties may be interested in acquiring us. We will continue to consider, evaluate and negotiate\nany such transactions as our Board of Directors deems appropriate and in the best interest of our stockholders.\nSuch potential transactions may divert the attention of management, and cause us to incur various costs and\nexpenses in investigating, evaluating and negotiating such transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\nRisks Associated with Financial Reporting\nThe complexity of calculating our tax provision may result in errors that could result in restatements of our\nfinancial statements.\nDue to the complexity associated with the calculation of our tax provision, including the effects of the enactment\nof new tax laws, we engage third-party tax advisors to assist us in the calculation. If we or our tax advisors fail\nto resolve or fully understand certain issues that we may have had in the past and issues that may arise in the\nfuture, we could be subject to errors, which, if material, would result in a restatement of our financial statements.\nRestatements are generally costly and could adversely impact our results of operations, damage our reputation,\nand/or have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nChanges in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries\nwhere we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates,\nby changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles\nor interpretations thereof and discrete items. In addition, we are subject to potential future examinations of our\nincome tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and tax authorities in various jurisdictions where\nwe have business operations. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to\ndetermine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from any\nexaminations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially significant tax consequences, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations.\nWe conduct our international operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries, branches and representative\noffices and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in\nthose jurisdictions. Such corporate structures are subject to complex transfer pricing, permanent establishment\nchallenges and other local regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Our provision\nfor income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including\nchanges in the geographic mix of our earnings and corporate tax rates among jurisdictions, challenges by tax\nauthorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance\nobligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, fluctuations\nin foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns,\nand changes in tax laws and regulations. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as\nto the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our\npositions were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, resulting in\nhigher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. Additionally, our\nfuture worldwide tax rates, financial position and operating results may be affected by changes in the relevant\ntax laws, interpretation of such tax laws or the influence of certain tax policy efforts, including in the EU and the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n25\nWe face risks in connection with our internal control over financial reporting and our auditors informed us\nof a material weakness.\nAs more fully disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report, late in the audit process, our\nauditors informed us of a material weakness that existed as of December 31, 2023, regarding ineffective design of\nthe controls related to management’s review and documentation of our inventory demand information and other\nassumptions used to determine the inventory carrying value adjustments necessary to record such quantities at the\nlower of their cost or net realizable value.\nDue to this finding of a material weakness, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\nnot effective as of December 31, 2023. While we do not believe that this material weakness has impacted the\naccuracy or reporting of our consolidated financial results, until this material weakness is remediated, or should\nnew material weaknesses arise or be discovered in the future, there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn addition, we may experience delays in satisfying our reporting obligations to comply with SEC rules and\nregulations, which could result in investigations and sanctions by regulatory authorities. Any of these results\ncould adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nRisks Associated with Regulatory Compliance, Intellectual Property Protection and Litigation\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act. Our failure to comply with these laws could\nresult in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and various anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions, which\ngenerally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for\nthe purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits. Although we have implemented policies\nand procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA,\nthe U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such\npolicies or procedures will work effectively all the time or protect us against liability under these laws for actions\ntaken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may\nacquire. We have significant operations in Asia, which place us in frequent contact with individuals who may\nbe considered “foreign officials” under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, resulting in an elevated risk of\npotential violations. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business\nwith government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other\nremedial measures, including restatements of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse impact\non our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation or allegations of any\npotential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by the U.S. or foreign authorities could harm our\nreputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to various governmental laws and regulations, and compliance with these regulations\nmay impact our revenue and cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with\napplicable regulations or obtain government licenses and approvals for our desired international trading\nactivities or technology transfers, we may be forced to recall products and cease their distribution, and we\ncould be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nOur business is subject to various significant laws and other legal requirements imposed by the U.S. and other\ncountries we conduct business in, including export control laws such as the Export Administration Act, the\nExport Administration Regulations and other laws, regulations and requirements governing international trade\nand technology transfer. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have generally become\nmore stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with these regulations or to\nremedy violations of these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may\nbe required to suspend sales to these customers, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We must\n26\nconform the manufacture and distribution of our products to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in\nmany countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or\ndistribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some\ncases, be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products are brought into compliance.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations.\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the environment,\nincluding those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers\nof those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of certain products.\nSuch laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate, including various EU\nmember countries and countries in Asia. There can be no assurance that similar laws and regulations will not be\nimplemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs, possible delays in delivering products, and even\nthe discontinuance of existing and planned future products if the costs were to become prohibitive.\nWe are subject to increasing regulatory and reporting standards related to ESG matters, which could increase\nour expenses.\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in public awareness and requirements from regulators, investors,\ncustomers and other key stakeholders focusing on ESG compliance efforts, including those related to\nenvironmental sustainability and social responsibility. For example, the SEC has proposed new rules that require\npublic companies to provide detailed disclosures of their climate-related risks, greenhouse gas emissions data,\nand net-zero transition plans, and in October 2023, California passed two bills that will require companies to\ndisclose greenhouse gas emissions data and climate-related financial risks. In addition, many of our customers\nincreasingly include stringent environmental and other non-standard compliance requirements in their contracts\nwith us or request significant amount of data from us for their Scope 3 emissions reporting. While we are\ncommitted to maintaining strong ESG strategies, practices, policies and disclosures, there can be no assurance\nthat we will be able to achieve our goals, or that our compliance initiatives will be deemed sufficiently robust by\nregulators, stockholders, customers and other key stakeholders. The achievement of our goals and initiatives may\nbe impacted by factors that are outside our control. Some of our stakeholders may disagree with our goals and\ninitiatives, and the focus and views of our stakeholders may change and evolve over time and vary depending\non the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, implement\nnew initiatives, comply with federal, state or international laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied\nstakeholder expectations and views, could result in litigation, regulatory action or other legal claims, penalties,\ninjunction or other remedies against us, damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our compliance efforts, including the collection, assessment and reporting of ESG data, are subject\nto evolving reporting standards and can be costly, complex and time-consuming. In addition, climate change\nconcerns and the potential associated environmental impact could result in the proposal and passage of additional\nlaws and regulations in various jurisdictions that may affect us, our suppliers and customers. Such laws and\nregulations could cause us to incur additional compliance costs, and failure to comply with the regulatory\nstandards in a timely manner could result in penalties and fines. These operational, legal, compliance and other\nrisks could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nGiven our inability to control the timing and nature of significant events in our legal proceedings that either\nhave arisen or may arise, our legal expenses are difficult to forecast and may vary substantially from our\npublicly disclosed forecasts with respect to any given quarter, which could contribute to increased volatility in\nour stock price and financial condition.\nHistorically, we have incurred significant expenses in connection with various legal proceedings that vary with\nthe level of activity in the proceeding. It is difficult for us to forecast our legal expenses for any given quarter,\nwhich adversely affects our ability to forecast our expected results of operations in general. We may also be\n27\nsubject to unanticipated legal proceedings, which would result in us incurring unexpected legal expenses. If\nwe fail to meet the expectations of securities or industry analysts as a result of unexpected changes in our legal\nexpenses, our stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nFuture legal proceedings may divert our financial and management resources.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims of infringement and litigation regarding patent\nand other intellectual property rights. Patent infringement is an ongoing risk, in part because other companies in\nour industry could have patent rights that may not be identifiable when we initiate development efforts. Litigation\nmay be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may have to defend ourselves, and in some\ncircumstances our key customers or suppliers, against additional infringement claims. Such litigation is very\ncostly. Further, in connection with these legal proceedings, we may be required to post bonds to defend our\nintellectual property rights in certain countries for an indefinite period of time, until such dispute is resolved. If\nour legal expenses materially increase or exceed anticipated amounts, our capital resources and financial condition\ncould be adversely affected. If we are not successful in any of our intellectual property defenses, we may have\nto cease production of certain products, design around such technologies, or pay royalty payments, any of which\ncould harm our financial condition and our business. Our management team may also be required to devote a\ngreat deal of time and effort to these legal proceedings, which could divert management’s attention from focusing\non our operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nFailure to protect our proprietary technologies or maintain the right to certain technologies may negatively\naffect our ability to compete.\nWe rely heavily on our proprietary technologies. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon\nour ability to obtain and maintain protection of certain proprietary technologies used in our products. We pursue\npatents for some of our new products and unique technologies, and we also rely on a combination of nondisclosure\nagreements and other contractual provisions, as well as our employees’ commitment to confidentiality and\nloyalty, to protect our technology, know-how and processes. Despite the precautions we take, it may be possible\nfor unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our current or future technologies or products, or to obtain and\nuse information that we regard as proprietary. We intend to continue to protect our proprietary technologies,\nincluding through patents. However, there can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to protect\nour proprietary rights, that our patent applications will lead to issued patents, that others will not develop or\npatent similar or superior products or technologies, or that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or\ncircumvented by others. Furthermore, the laws of the countries in which our products are or may be developed,\nmanufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in\nthe U.S. Our failure to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could materially harm our business.\nIf we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings brought against us or any of our customers, we could be prevented\nfrom selling many of our products and/or be required to pay substantial damages. An unfavorable outcome\nor an additional award of damages, attorneys’ fees or an injunction could cause our revenue to decline\nsignificantly and could severely harm our business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings. If we are not successful in litigation that could\nbe brought against us or our customers, we could be ordered to pay monetary fines and/or damages, including\nexpenses and damages against our customers. If we are found liable for willful patent infringement, damages\ncould be significant. We and/or our customers could also be prevented from selling some or all of our products.\nMoreover, our customers and end users could decide not to use our products, and our products and our customers’\naccounts payable to us could be seized. Finally, interim developments in these proceedings could increase the\nvolatility in our stock price as the market assesses the impact of such developments on the likelihood that we\nwill or will not ultimately prevail in these proceedings. Even if resolved favorably, such proceedings can be very\nexpensive and time consuming, and may divert management’s attention from other business operations.\n28\nRisks Associated with Human Capital Management\nThe loss of any of our key personnel or the failure to attract or retain specialized technical and management\npersonnel could affect our operations or impair our ability to grow our business.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical and managerial\npersonnel. We are particularly dependent on the continued services of our key executives, including Michael\nHsing, our President and Chief Executive Officer, who founded our company and developed our proprietary\nprocess technology. In addition, personnel with highly skilled analog and mixed-signal design engineering\nexpertise are scarce and competition for personnel with these skills is intense. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, integrating or retaining\nother highly qualified personnel with critical capabilities in the future. If we are unable to retain the services of\nexisting key employees or are unsuccessful in attracting new highly qualified employees quickly enough to meet\nthe demands of our business, including design cycles, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, if we lose key\npersonnel, the search for a qualified replacement and the transition could interrupt our operations as the search\ncould take us longer than expected and divert management resources, and the newly hired employee could take\nlonger than expected to effectively integrate into the team.\nIf we fail to retain key employees in our sales, engineering, finance and legal functions or to make continued\nimprovements to our internal systems, our business may suffer.\nIf we fail to continue to adequately staff our sales, engineering, financial and legal positions, maintain or upgrade\nour business systems and maintain internal controls that meet the demands of our business, we may not be able\nto effectively execute our business strategy. The operation of our business also depends upon our ability to retain\nthese employees, as they hold a significant amount of institutional knowledge about us and our products and, if\nthey were to terminate their employment, our sales, operations and internal control over financial reporting could\nbe adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with Ownership of Our Stock\nThe future trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety\nof factors.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and could be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n• actual or anticipated results of operations and financial performance, including our ability to accurately\nforecast future demand for our products;\n• actual or anticipated manufacturing capacity limitations;\n• our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain market share, manage litigation\nrisk, diversify our customer base and successfully secure manufacturing capacity;\n• our ability to maintain or increase our gross margins;\n• costs of increasing wafer capacity and qualifying additional third-party wafer fabrication facilities;\n• our loss of key customers;\n• investments in sales and marketing resources to enter new markets;\n• commencement of or developments relating to litigation;\n• cyberattacks or other system security, data protection and privacy breaches;\n• the inclusion, exclusion or deletion of our common stock from any major trading indices, such as the\nS&P 500 Index;\n29\n• our sale of common stock or other securities in the future;\n• any mergers, acquisitions or divestitures of assets undertaken by us;\n• our ability to obtain governmental licenses and approvals for international trading activities or technology\ntransfers, including export licenses;\n• our ability to meet or exceed the guidance that we provide to our investors and analysts;\n• our ability to continue the stock repurchase program and pay quarterly cash dividends to stockholders;\n• our ability to meet or exceed our, our investors’ or analysts’ expectations;\n• market reactions to guidance from other semiconductor companies or third-party research groups;\n• market reactions to merger and acquisition activities in the semiconductor industry, and rumors or\nexpectations of further consolidation in the industry;\n• investor perceptions of us and our business strategies;\n• the breadth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n• trading activity in our common stock, including short positions;\n• actions by institutional or other large stockholders;\n• changes in the estimation of the future size and growth rate of our markets;\n• introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n• general economic, industry and market conditions worldwide, including any global economic downturn;\n• developments generally affecting the semiconductor industry;\n• terrorist acts or acts of war, including the ongoing Ukraine-Russia and Middle East conflicts;\n• epidemics and pandemics;\n• developments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n• conditions and trends in technology industries;\n• changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors;\n• government debt default;\n• changes in corporate tax laws;\n• government policies and regulations on international trade policies and restrictions, including tariffs on\nimports of foreign goods;\n• export controls, trade and economic sanctions and regulations, and other regulatory or contractual\nlimitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets, particularly in China;\n• ratings published by third-party organizations with respect to our ESG compliance efforts;\n• our compliance with regulatory mandates focusing on ESG issues, including climate risks and social\ninitiatives; and\n• our performance against the ESG guidelines set by institutional stockholders and customers, and our\nability to meet or exceed their expectations.\n30\nIn addition, the stock market often experiences substantial volatility that may be unrelated to the operating\nperformance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of\nour common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts downgrade our stock or do not continue to publish research or reports about\nour business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that industry or\nsecurities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If we fail to\nmeet the expectations of these analysts, or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our\nstock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish\nreports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading\nvolume to decline.\nShort positions in our stock could have a substantial impact on the trading price of our stock.\nHistorically, there have been “short” positions in our common stock. The anticipated downward pressure on our\nstock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short\nsales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline. Such stock price decreases could encourage\nfurther short-sales that could place additional downward pressure on our stock price. This could lead to further\nincreases in the existing short position in our common stock and cause decreases and volatility in our stock price.\nThe volatility of our stock may cause the value of a stockholder’s investment to decline rapidly. Additionally, if\nour stock price declines, it may be more difficult for us to raise capital and may have other adverse effects on\nour business.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all.\nWe have a dividend program approved by our Board of Directors, pursuant to which we intend to pay quarterly\ncash dividends on our common stock. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our\nBoard of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital\nrequirements, business conditions, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as a\ndetermination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Our dividend payments may change\nfrom time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular\namounts or at all. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price\nof our common stock and on the return achieved by our stockholders.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn October 2023, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up\nto $640 million in the aggregate of our common stock. The repurchase program will expire on October 29, 2026.\nThe amount, timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on market conditions\nand our priorities for the use of our cash. We are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of\nshares, on any particular timetable, or at all. The repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time\nand, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIf we issue additional shares of stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock in the future in order to raise additional capital to fund our global\noperations or in connection with an acquisition. Any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate\ndilution to our stockholders. In addition, the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may require\nadditional regulatory compliance, such as stockholder approval.\n31\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur worldwide operations are subject to economic and geopolitical uncertainty, health risks, climate crises and\nother natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur offices in California and Washington, the production facilities of our third-party wafer suppliers, our IC\ntesting and manufacturing facilities, a portion of our assembly and research and development activities, and\ncertain other critical business operations are located in or near seismically active regions and are subject to\nperiodic earthquakes. We do not maintain earthquake insurance and could be materially and adversely affected in\nthe event of a major earthquake. Much of our revenue, as well as our manufacturing and assembly partners, are\nconcentrated in Asia, particularly in China. Such concentration increases the risk that earthquakes or other natural\ndisasters, labor strikes, epidemics and pandemics, and/or health advisories could disrupt our operations and have\na material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. For example, in 2022, China experienced\na severe heatwave during the summer months in the Sichuan province, which resulted in widespread power\nshortages, rolling backouts and temporary business shutdowns imposed by the local governments. Although we\nwere able to successfully execute our contingency plan and our operations were not materially and adversely\ndisrupted by the events, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to mitigate the operational risks caused by\nextreme weather conditions or other events in the future.\nIn addition, we rely heavily on our internal information and communications systems and on systems or support\nservices from third parties to manage our operations efficiently and effectively. Any of these are subject to failure\ndue to a natural disaster or other disruptions. System-wide or local failures that affect our information processing\ncould have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. and other regions where we conduct business have been and may continue to be affected by conflicts that\ncould, among other things, disrupt our supply chain, and impact customer demands and component prices. For\nexample, the U.S. and other countries have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures on Russia\ndue to the conflict in Ukraine. Although such measures have not significantly affected our business or operations,\nfuture developments could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nItem 1B.

Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the imperative to diligently manage cybersecurity risks as defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K.\nSuch risks include operational risks of ransomware, phishing, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers\nand violation of data privacy or security laws.\nWe address cybersecurity risks in our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues through\na diversified approach including threat-monitoring and assessments by third-parties, adopting IT security ISO\nstandards/governance, proactive risk and compliance reviews. In order to defend against cybersecurity incidents,\nwe carry out real-time cybersecurity threat monitoring of IT assets, perform penetration testing, audit applicable\ndata policies and conduct directed employee training. We also monitor existing and emerging laws and regulations\nrelated to data protection and information security and implement appropriate changes. We maintain an insurance\npolicy that provides certain coverage for losses we incur due to data breaches and other cybersecurity incidents.\nWe implemented incident response and breach management processes consisting of four stages: 1) monitor for\nand identify cybersecurity incidents, 2) carry out security incident analysis, 3) contain and recover, and 4) improve\nwith post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are governed by the Cybersecurity Steering Committee.\n32\nWe regularly engage external auditors to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and compliance and have\nbeen certified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001.\nThere are no identified cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect our results of operations, or financial condition as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee “Risk Factors” for more information on our cybersecurity risks.\nCybersecurity Governance\nAs an important part of our risk management processes, cybersecurity is a focus area for our Board and\nmanagement. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “NCG Committee”), which consists\nof independent members of the Board of Directors, is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity\nthreats. The NCG Committee receives quarterly updates from the Cybersecurity Steering Committee. These\nupdates include existing and emerging cybersecurity threats, risks, cybersecurity incident management and key\ninformation security initiatives. The NCG Committee also provides updates to our cybersecurity risk management\nand strategy programs to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by the Cybersecurity Steering Committee,\nwhich includes individuals with an average of over 18 years of prior work experience in various roles involving\nIT governance and management, cybersecurity, auditing, and compliance. The Cybersecurity Steering Committee\nactively participates in the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes as described above, and regularly\nreports to senior management and the NCG Committee.\nItem 2. Properties\nAs of December 31, 2023, our owned and leased facilities in excess of 10,000 square feet consisted of:\nOther\nUnited States Countries Total\n(in square feet)\nOwned facilities ................................ 216,000 923,000 1,139,000\nLeased facilities ................................ — 290,000 290,000\nTotal facilities .................................. 216,000 1,213,000 1,429,000\nWe also lease other sales and marketing, and research and development offices in Asia, Europe and the United\nStates. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable for our current operations.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including challenges to the\nenforceability or validity of our intellectual property, claims that our products infringe on the intellectual property\nrights of others, and employment matters. We may also be subject to litigation initiated by our stockholders. These\nproceedings often involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds\nand the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. We defend ourselves vigorously against any such\nclaims. As of December 31, 2023, there were no material pending legal proceedings to which we were a party.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n33\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of\nEquity Securities.\nCommon Stock Information\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “MPWR”.\nHolders of Common Stock\nAs of February 22, 2024, there were 68 registered holders of record of our common stock. A substantially greater\nnumber of holders of our common stock are “street name” or beneficial holders, whose shares are held by banks,\nbrokers and other financial institutions on their behalf.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn October 2023, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase\nup to $640.0 million in the aggregate of our common stock through October 29, 2026. Shares are retired upon\nrepurchase. We repurchased approximately 7,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price\nof $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nStock repurchases under the program may be made through open market repurchases, privately negotiated\ntransactions or other structures in accordance with applicable state and federal securities laws, at times and in\namounts as management deems appropriate. The timing and the number of any repurchased common stock will\nbe determined by our management based on the evaluation of market conditions, legal requirements, stock price,\nand other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate us to purchase any particular number of shares and\nmay be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nThe following table represents details of our stock repurchase transactions during the fourth quarter of 2023:\nTotal Number of Approximate\nShares Purchased Dollar Value of\nTotal Number Average as Part of Publicly Shares that May\nof Shares Price Paid Announced Yet Be Purchased\nPeriod Purchased per Share Program Under the Program\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNovember 1, 2023 – November 30, 2023 ..... 5 $ 505.65 5 $ 637,465\nDecember 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023 ..... 2 $ 603.15 2 $ 636,259\nTotal ................................. 7 $ 533.45 7\nDividend Policy\nWe currently have a dividend program approved by our Board of Directors, pursuant to which we intend to pay\nquarterly cash dividends on our common stock.

[Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes\nwhich appear under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contain, in addition\nto historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may\ndiffer materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including\nthose set forth under “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDiscussions of 2021 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are omitted in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed\nwith the SEC on February 24, 2023.\n35\nOverview\nWe are a fabless global company that provides high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronics\nsolutions. MPS’s mission is to reduce energy and material consumption to improve all aspects of quality of life\nand create a sustainable future. Founded in 1997 by our CEO Michael Hsing, MPS has three core strengths: deep\nsystem-level knowledge, strong semiconductor design expertise, and innovative proprietary technologies in the\nareas of semiconductor processes, system integration, and packaging. These combined advantages are designed to\nenable MPS to deliver reliable, compact, and monolithic solutions that are highly energy-efficient, cost-effective,\nand environmentally responsible while providing a consistent return on investment to our stockholders.\nWe operate in the cyclical semiconductor industry. We are subject to industry downturns, but we have targeted\nproduct and market areas that we believe have the ability to offer above average industry performance over the\nlong term. Historically, our revenue has generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first\nhalf although various factors, such as market conditions and the timing of key product introductions, could impact\nthis trend.\nWe work with third parties to manufacture and assemble our ICs. This has enabled us to limit our capital\nexpenditures and fixed costs, while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strengths.\nFollowing the introduction of a product, our sales cycle generally takes a number of quarters after we receive\nan initial customer order for a new product to ramp up. Typical supply chain lead times for orders are generally\n16 to 26 weeks. These factors, combined with the fact that our customers can cancel or reschedule orders without\nsignificant penalty to the customer, make the forecasting of our orders and revenue difficult.\nWe derive most of our revenue from sales through distribution arrangements and direct sales to customers in Asia,\nwhere our products are incorporated into end-user products. Our revenue from direct or indirect sales to customers\nin Asia was 87%, 86% and 90% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We derive a\nmajority of our revenue from the sales of our DC to DC converter products which serve the storage and computing,\nenterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets. We believe our ability to achieve\nrevenue growth will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products, enter new market segments, gain\nmarket share, manage litigation risk, diversify our customer base and continue to secure manufacturing capacity.\nMacroeconomic Conditions and Recent Regulations\nDuring 2023, the semiconductor industry faced, and continues to face, a number of macro-economic challenges\nincluding reduced consumer spending, fluctuations in demand for semiconductors, rising inflation, increased\ninterest rates, and fluctuations in currency rates. We remain cautious in light of continued challenging\nmacroeconomic conditions and will continue to monitor the potential impact on our operations. The extent and\nduration of the direct and indirect impact of macroeconomic events on our business, results of operations and\noverall financial position remain uncertain and depend on future developments.\nWe closely monitor changes to export control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements. As of December\n31, 2023 and through the date we filed this Annual Report, no existing or newly introduced restrictions have had\na material impact on our revenue and operations. We will continue to monitor any changes or developments to\nexport control laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements, or interpretations thereof and are committed\nto complying with all applicable trade laws, regulations and other requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated\nfinancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure\nof contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related\nto revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, inventories, income taxes and contingencies. We base our\n36\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets\nand liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Estimates and judgments used in the preparation of\nour financial statements are, by their nature, uncertain and unpredictable, and depend upon, among other things,\nmany factors outside of our control, including demand for our products, economic conditions and other current and\nfuture events, such as macroeconomic factors, including the impact of the 2023 banking crisis, global economic\ndownturn, Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Middle East conflict. Actual results could differ from these estimates\nand assumptions, and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. See Note\n1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a\nsummary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments used in the preparation\nof our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for price adjustments and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the transaction\nprice and recognize that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized. Certain U.S.-based\ndistributors have price adjustment rights when they sell our products to their end customers at a price that is lower\nthan the distribution price invoiced by us. When we receive claims from the distributors that products have been\nsold to the end customers at the lower price, we issue the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments. We\nestimate the price adjustments using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical claims, at both\nthe distributor and product level, as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix.\nCertain distributors have limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the\nprevious six months’ purchases in accordance with the contract terms. We estimate the stock rotation returns\nusing the expected value method based on an analysis of historical returns, and the current level of inventory in\nthe distribution channel.\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration have been materially\nconsistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual\nprovisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our\nrevenue and operating results.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost determined on a first-in first-\nout basis) and estimated net realizable value. We write down excess and obsolete inventories based on their age and\nforecasted demand, which includes estimates taking into consideration our revenue forecast, outlook on market\nand economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and changes in strategic direction. If\nactual demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory\nwrite-downs may be required. Conversely, if actual demand or market conditions are more favorable, inventories\nmay be sold that were previously written down.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nOur calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and\ninvolves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of current and deferred\ntax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty, finality or uncertainty to an anticipated\noutcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in\nother facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax for\nuncertain income tax positions taken on our tax returns if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. If\nwe determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current\nassessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our\nfinancial statements in the period such determination is made.\n37\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $35.0 million and $20.3 million, respectively,\nattributable to management’s determination that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will not\nbe fully realized. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize the\ndeferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for\nthe deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should it be\ndetermined that additional amounts of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, an adjustment\nto increase the deferred tax assets valuation allowance will be charged to income in the period such determination\nis made.\nContingencies\nWe record a contingent liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings when it is probable that a loss\nhas been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. Based on the facts and circumstances in each matter,\nthe determination of such liability requires significant judgment. In determining the amount of a contingent\nloss, we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal\nproceedings, settlement negotiations, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates\nmade by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available, we may need to record\nadditional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. Alternatively, if\nthe judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted, for example, if a particular contingent loss does\nnot occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on our results\nof operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor equity awards with performance conditions, as well as awards containing both market and performance\nconditions, we recognize compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be\nachieved. Management performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors,\nsuch as macroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts, and internal factors, such as our\nbusiness and operational objectives and revenue forecasts. Changes in the probability assessment of achievement\nof the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up\nadjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date. If the projected achievement\nwas revised upward or if the actual results were higher than the projected achievement, additional compensation\nexpense would be recorded for the awards due to the cumulative catch-up adjustment, which would have an\nadverse impact on our results of operations. Conversely, if the projected achievement was revised downward or if\nthe actual results were lower than the projected achievement, previously accrued compensation expense would be\nreversed for the awards, which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations. As a result, our stock-\nbased compensation expense is subject to volatility and may fluctuate significantly each quarter due to changes\nin our probability assessment of achievement of the performance conditions or actual results being different from\nprojections made by management.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding a recently adopted accounting\npronouncement and recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2023.\n38\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue ................... $1,821,072 100.0% $1,794,148 100.0% $1,207,798 100.0%\nCost of revenue ............. 799,953 43.9 745,596 41.6 522,339 43.2\nGross profit ................ 1,021,119 56.1 1,048,552 58.4 685,459 56.8\nOperating expenses: .........\nResearch and development 263,643 14.5 240,171 13.4 190,627 15.8\nSelling, general and\nadministrative ....... 275,740 15.1 281,596 15.6 232,415 19.3\nTotal operating\nexpenses ........ 539,383 29.6 521,767 29.0 423,042 35.1\nOperating income ........... 481,736 26.5 526,785 29.4 262,417 21.7\nOther income (expense), net ... 24,105 1.3 (1,848) (0.1) 9,802 0.8\nIncome before income taxes ... 505,841 27.8 524,937 29.3 272,219 22.5\nIncome tax expense .......... 78,467 4.3 87,265 4.9 30,196 2.5\nNet income ................ $ 427,374 23.5% $ 437,672 24.4% $ 242,023 20.0%\nRevenue\nThe following table summarizes our revenue by end market:\nYear Ended December 31,\n% of % of % of\nEnd Market 2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue 2021 Revenue\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nStorage and Computing ....... $ 491,139 27.0% $ 452,594 25.3% $ 255,933 21.2%\nEnterprise Data ............. 322,980 17.7 251,415 14.0 116,345 9.6\nAutomotive ................ 394,665 21.7 300,016 16.7 204,335 16.9\nIndustrial .................. 172,717 9.4 219,179 12.2 184,784 15.3\nCommunications ............ 204,911 11.3 251,452 14.0 164,091 13.6\nConsumer ................. 234,660 12.9 319,492 17.8 282,310 23.4\nTotal ..................... $1,821,072 100.0% $1,794,148 100.0% $1,207,798 100.0%\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,821.1 million, an increase of $27.0 million, or 1.5%, from\n$1,794.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increases\nin the average selling prices resulting primarily from product mix, partially offset by lower shipment volume.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue from the storage and computing market increased $38.5\nmillion, or 8.5%, from the same period in 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales of\nproducts for notebooks. Revenue from the enterprise data market increased $71.6 million, or 28.5%, from the\nsame period in 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher sales of our power management solutions for\nAI applications. Revenue from the automotive market increased $94.6 million, or 31.5%, from the same period\nin 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales of our highly integrated applications supporting\nadvanced driver assistance systems, body electronics and the digital cockpit. Revenue from the industrial market\ndecreased $46.5 million, or 21.2%, from the same period in 2022. This decrease primarily reflected lower sales\nin applications for industrial automation, security and power sources. Revenue from the communications market\ndecreased $46.5 million, or 18.5%, from the same period in 2022. The decrease was a result of lower 4G and 5G\ninfrastructure sales. Revenue from the consumer market decreased $84.8 million, or 26.6%, from the same period\nin 2022. This decrease was a result of broad market weakness across all segments.\n39\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred to manufacture, assemble and test our products, as well as\nwarranty costs, inventory-related and other overhead costs, and stock-based compensation expenses.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCost of revenue ............................ $ 799,953 $ 745,596 $ 522,339\nAs a percentage of revenue ................... 43.9% 41.6% 43.2%\nGross profit ............................... $ 1,021,119 $ 1,048,552 $ 685,459\nGross margin .............................. 56.1% 58.4% 56.8%\nCost of revenue was $800.0 million, or 43.9% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $745.6\nmillion, or 41.6% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $54.4 million increase in cost of revenue\nwas primarily driven by product mix, partially offset by lower inventory write-downs and warranty expenses.\nGross margin was 56.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with 58.4% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease in gross margin was mainly driven by product mix, partially offset by lower\ninventory write-downs and warranty expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nResearch and Development (“R&D”)\nR&D expenses primarily consist of cash compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation and deferred\ncompensation for design and product engineers, expenses related to new product development and supplies, and\nfacility costs.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nR&D expenses ............................ $ 263,643 $ 240,171 $ 190,627\nAs a percentage of revenue ................... 14.5% 13.4% 15.8%\nR&D expenses were $263.6 million, or 14.5% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $240.2\nmillion, or 13.4% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $23.5 million increase in R&D expenses\nwas primarily due to a $20.9 million increase in new product development expenses, a $5.6 million increase in\nexpenses related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan liabilities and a $1.8 million increase in\ndepreciation. This increase was partially offset by an $8.1 million decrease in cash compensation expenses, which\nwas driven by decreased bonuses.\nSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”)\nSG&A expenses primarily include cash compensation and benefits, stock-based compensation and deferred\ncompensation for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales commissions, travel expenses, facilities\ncosts, third party service fees and litigation expenses.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nSG&A expenses ........................... $ 275,740 $ 281,596 $ 232,415\nAs a percentage of revenue ................... 15.1% 15.6% 19.3%\n40\nSG&A expenses were $275.7 million, or 15.1% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $281.6\nmillion, or 15.6% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $5.9 million decrease in SG&A\nexpenses was driven by a $12.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses, an $8.8 million decrease\nin cash compensation expenses driven by decreased bonuses, and a $3.1 million decrease in litigation expenses.\nThis decrease was partially offset by a $10.1 million increase in expenses related to changes in the value of the\ndeferred compensation plan liabilities, and an $8.2 million increase consisting mostly of travel related expenses,\nthird party service expenses and software licensing fees.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income, net, was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with other expense, net, of\n$1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in other income was primarily due to an increase\nof $18.6 million in net interest income as a result of higher interest rates, and an increase of $15.1 million in\nincome related to changes in the value of deferred compensation plan investments, partially offset by an increase\nof $9.0 million in charitable contributions.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $78.5 million, or 15.5% of pre-tax income.\nThe effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to foreign income from\nour subsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates and a return to provision true-up\nadjustment which primarily resulted from a calculation refinement of our capitalization of research and experimental\nexpenditures under Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). The decrease in the effective tax rate\nrelative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset by the inclusion of the global intangible low-taxed income\n(“GILTI”) tax, the addition of a valuation allowance against China deferred tax assets arising from the indefinite\nextension of the R&D super deduction policy in China, and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $87.3 million, or 16.6% of pre-tax income.\nThe effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to foreign income from our\nsubsidiaries in Bermuda and China being taxed at lower statutory tax rates, and excess tax benefits from stock-\nbased compensation. The decrease in the effective tax rate relative to the federal statutory rate was partially offset\nby the inclusion of the GILTI tax.\nIn December 2023, the Bermuda Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 (the “Bermuda CIT Act”) was enacted and\nsigned into law. The Bermuda CIT Act includes a 15% corporate income tax (“CIT”) applicable to Bermuda\nbusinesses that are multinational enterprise (“MNE”) groups with annual revenue of €750M or more beginning\nin 2025. The Bermuda CIT Act also includes an Economic Transition Adjustment (“ETA”) that requires MNE’s\nto revalue their assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, at their fair value as of September 30, 2023. There is an\nelection to opt out of the ETA. As the Bermuda CIT Act is not effective until January 1, 2025, we are evaluating\nwhether or not to adopt this ETA. Based on information available, we have not recorded any changes to income\ntax expense related to the Bermuda CIT Act as of December 31, 2023.\nIn August 2022, the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) were enacted and signed\ninto law, which did not have a material impact on our income tax provisions, results of operations or financial\ncondition for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. We will continue to monitor any new developments\nrelated to the CHIPS Act and the IRA and evaluate their impact on our financial statements.\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n41\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCash and cash equivalents ....................................... $ 527,843 $ 288,607\nShort-term investments .......................................... 580,633 449,266\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments ............ $ 1,108,476 $ 737,873\nPercentage of total assets ..................................... 45.5% 35.8%\nTotal current assets ............................................. $ 1,819,499 $ 1,410,619\nTotal current liabilities .......................................... (235,035) (263,400)\nWorking capital ............................................ $ 1,584,464 $ 1,147,219\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $527.8 million and short-term investments of\n$580.6 million, compared with cash and cash equivalents of $288.6 million and short-term investments of $449.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, $369.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and\n$528.0 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. For the year ended December\n31, 2023, we repatriated $140 million of cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to the U.S. with minimal tax impact.\nThe proceeds are primarily used to fund our ongoing business operations. We may repatriate additional cash from\nour Bermuda subsidiary to fund our expenditures in future periods. We anticipate that earnings from other foreign\nsubsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities ............. $ 638,213 $ 246,674 $ 320,010\nNet cash used in investing activities ................. (178,726) (12,510) (378,886)\nNet cash used in financing activities ................. (183,725) (128,785) (90,206)\nEffect of change in exchange rates .................. (3,310) (6,039) 3,400\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash .............................. $ 272,452 $ 99,340 $ (145,682)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the $391.5 million increase in cash provided by operating activities\ncompared to the prior period was primarily due to decreased inventory purchases, decreased prepaid wafer\nexpenses, increased accounts receivable collections and other changes in working capital.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the $166.2 million increase in cash used in investing activities compared\nto the prior period was primarily due to an increase of $518.9 million in purchases of investments, partially offset\nby an increase of $340.4 million in sales of investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the $54.9 million increase in cash used in financing activities compared\nto the prior period was primarily due to a $47.9 million increase in dividend and dividend equivalent payments.\nCash Requirements\nAlthough consequences of economic uncertainty and macroeconomic conditions and other factors could adversely\naffect our liquidity and capital resources in the future, and cash requirements may fluctuate based on the timing\nand extent of many factors such as those discussed above, we believe that our balances of cash, cash equivalents\nand short-term investments of $1,108.5 million as of December 31, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing\noperations, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.\n42\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent commitments to our suppliers and other parties requiring the purchases of goods or\nservices. Our purchase obligations primarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases, assembly and other\nmanufacturing services, construction of manufacturing and R&D facilities, purchases of production and other\nequipment, and license arrangements.\nIn May 2022, we entered into a long-term supply agreement in order to secure manufacturing production capacity\nfor silicon wafers over a four-year period. As of December 31, 2023, we had remaining prepayments under this\nagreement of $120.0 million reported in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2023, total estimated future unconditional purchase commitments to all suppliers and other\nparties, net of the $120.0 million prepayment, were $699.7 million, of which $367.8 million was classified\nas short-term.\nTransition Tax Liability\nThe transition tax liability represents the one-time, mandatory deemed repatriation tax imposed on previously\ndeferred foreign earnings under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”).\nAs permitted by the 2017 Tax Act, we have elected to pay the tax liability in installments on an interest-free basis\nthrough 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining liability totaled $11.1 million, of which $4.9 million\nwas short-term.\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease obligations represent the undiscounted remaining lease payments primarily for our leased\nfacilities and equipment. As of December 31, 2023, these obligations totaled $7.9 million, of which $2.3 million\nwas short-term.\nCapital Return to Stockholders\nIn October 2023, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase\nup to $640.0 million in the aggregate of our common stock through October 29, 2026. Shares are retired upon\nrepurchase. We repurchased approximately 7,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price\nof $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, $636.3 million remained\navailable for future repurchases under the program.\nWe currently have a dividend program approved by our Board of Directors, pursuant to which we intend to pay\nquarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Based on our historical practice, stockholders of record as of the\nlast business day of the quarter are entitled to receive the quarterly cash dividends when and if declared by the\nBoard of Directors, which are payable to the stockholders in the following month. As of December 31, 2023,\naccrued dividends totaled $47.9 million. The declaration of any future cash dividends is at the discretion of our\nBoard of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital\nrequirements, business conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant, as well as a\ndetermination that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $1.00 per\nshare to $1.25 per share, which amount will be paid on April 15, 2024 to all stockholders of record as of the close\nof business on March 29, 2024.\nOther Long-Term Obligations\nOther long-term obligations primarily include payments for deferred compensation plan liabilities and accrued\ndividend equivalents. As of December 31, 2023, these obligations totaled $83.1 million.\n43\nAcquisition\nOn January 3, 2024, we acquired Axign, a Dutch company for $33.8 million in cash. See Note 17 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nItem 7A. Q uantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur cash equivalents and short-term investments are subject to market risk, primarily interest rate and credit risk.\nOur investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by management\nand approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Such guidelines include security type, credit\nquality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt\ninstruments with relatively short-term maturities. Based on our investment positions as of December 31, 2023,\nthe impact of changes in interest rates on our interest income was immaterial.\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale, which are reported at fair value with the\nunrealized gains or losses being included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. When the fair value of an investment is below its amortized cost basis, unrealized losses due to changes in\ninterest rates (i.e., non-credit loss factors) are not recognized in our results of operations unless we have the intent\nto sell the securities or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before recovery of\nthe entire amortized cost basis. Based on our investment positions as of December 31, 2023, a hypothetical 100\nbasis point increase in interest rates would result in a $4.5 million decline in the fair value of our investments. Any\nlosses resulting from such interest rate changes would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.\nWe do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur sales outside the United States are primarily transacted in U.S. dollars through our subsidiary in Bermuda.\nAccordingly, our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes. The functional currency\nof our offshore operations is generally the local currency, primarily including the Renminbi, the New Taiwan\nDollar and the Euro. We incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain transactions, including\nintercompany transactions between the U.S. and our foreign subsidiaries, that are denominated in a currency other\nthan the functional currency. Gains or losses from the remeasurement and settlement of the balances are reported\nin other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented.\n44\nItem 8.

(the Company)\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,\nstockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the\nrelated notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December\n31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed\nan adverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich it relates.\n46\nInventory Valuation\nDescription of the Matter The Company’s inventories totaled $383.7 million as of December 31, 2023,\nrepresenting 15.8% of total assets. As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company values inventories at the lower of standard\ncost (which approximates actual cost determined on a first-in first-out basis)\nand estimated net realizable value in each reporting period. Excess and obsolete\ninventory is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost.\nAuditing management’s estimates for excess and obsolete inventory involved\nsubjective auditor judgment because management’s assessment of whether a\nwrite down is required and the measurement of any excess of cost over net\nrealizable value is judgmental and considers a number of qualitative factors\nthat are affected by market and economic conditions outside the Company’s\ncontrol. In particular, determination of excess and obsolete inventory utilizes\nassumptions, including estimated demand for the Company’s products, new\nproduct launches, expected industry sales growth, and product lifecycle.\nHow We Addressed the Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant\nMatter in Our Audit assumptions stated above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the\nunderlying data used in management’s excess and obsolete inventory valuation\nassessment. We evaluated inventory levels compared to forecasted product\ndemand, historical sales and specific product considerations. We also assessed\nthe historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity\nanalyses over the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the\nexcess and obsolete inventory estimates that would result from changes in the\nunderlying assumptions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 29, 2024\n47\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,\nbecause of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the\ncontrol criteria, Monolithic Power Systems, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim\nfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has\nbeen identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in\ncontrols related to the company’s inventory demand forecasting process.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes. This material weakness was\nconsidered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023 consolidated\nfinancial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 29, 2024, which expressed an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that\na material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based\non the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n48\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 29, 2024\n49\nMONOLITHIC POWER SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except par value)\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents .................................... $ 527,843 $ 288,607\nShort-term investments ...................................... 580,633 449,266\nAccounts receivable, net ..................................... 179,858 182,714\nInventories ................................................ 383,702 447,290\nOther current assets ......................................... 147,463 42,742\nTotal current assets ...................................... 1,819,499 1,410,619\nProperty and equipment, net ...................................... 368,952 357,157\nGoodwill ..................................................... 6,571 6,571\nDeferred tax assets, net .......................................... 28,054 35,252\nOther long-term assets .......................................... 211,277 249,286\nTotal assets ............................................ $ 2,434,353 $ 2,058,885\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable ........................................... $ 62,958 $ 61,461\nAccrued compensation and related benefits ...................... 56,286 88,260\nOther accrued liabilities ...................................... 115,791 113,679\nTotal current liabilities ................................... 235,035 263,400\nIncome tax liabilities ........................................ 60,724 53,509\nOther long-term liabilities .................................... 88,655 73,374\nTotal liabilities ......................................... 384,414 390,283\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ equity:\nCommon stock and additional paid-in capital: $0.001 par value; shares\nauthorized: 150,000; shares issued and outstanding: 48,028 and\n47,107, respectively ..................................... 1,129,937 975,276\nRetained earnings ........................................... 947,064 716,403\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss .........................

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness\nMonolithic Power Systems, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of California on August 22,\n1997. On November 17, 2004, the Company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware. MPS designs, develops\nand markets high-performance, semiconductor-based power electronic solutions. MPS’s mission is to provide\ninnovative power solutions in the storage and computing, enterprise data, automotive, industrial, communications\nand consumer markets.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nIntercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements primarily\ninclude those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, valuation of share-based awards, contingencies\nand income tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and any\nsuch differences may be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nCertain Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of\ncash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash equivalents\ninclude short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of three\nmonths or less. The Company’s short-term investments may consist of corporate debt securities, certificates of\ndeposit, commercial paper and government agency bonds and treasuries, and the long-term investments consist\nof government-backed student loan auction-rate securities.\nThe Company does not require its customers to provide collateral to support accounts receivable. The Company\nassesses the collectability by reviewing accounts receivable on a customer-by-customer basis. To manage credit\nrisk, management performs ongoing credit evaluations of the customers’ financial condition, monitors payment\nperformance, and assesses current economic conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future\neconomic conditions, that may affect collectability of the outstanding receivables. For certain high-risk customers,\nthe Company requires standby letters of credit or advance payment prior to shipments of goods.\nThe Company participates in the dynamic high technology industry and believes that changes in any of the\nfollowing areas could have a material adverse effect on its future financial position, results of operations or cash\nflows: advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards; competitive pressures in the form of\nnew products or price reductions on current products; changes in product mix; changes in the overall demand\nfor products offered by the Company or in specific markets; changes in third-party manufacturers or the terms of\nsuch arrangements; changes in key suppliers; changes in certain strategic relationships or customer relationships;\nlitigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property, patent, product, regulatory or other\nfactors; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; risk associated with changes in government policies and\nregulations on trade restrictions and corporate taxes; availability of necessary components or sub-assemblies;\navailability of foundry capacity; ability to integrate acquired companies; and the Company’s ability to attract and\nretain employees necessary to support its growth.\n55\nForeign Currency\nIn general, the functional currency of the Company’s international subsidiaries is the local currency. The primary\nsubsidiaries are located in China, Taiwan and Europe, which utilize the Renminbi, the New Taiwan Dollar and the\nEuro as their currencies, respectively. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated\nusing exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenue and costs are translated using average exchange\nrates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\nloss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn addition, the Company incurs foreign currency exchange gains or losses related to certain transactions, including\nintercompany transactions, that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. In connection\nwith the remeasurement and settlement of the balances, the Company recorded foreign currency exchange gain\n(loss) of $(0.2) million, $0.5 million and $(0.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, which were reported in other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor intercompany transactions that are of a long-term investment nature, the Company records the foreign currency\nexchange gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash Equivalents and Debt Investments\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents. The Company may classify investments with maturities beyond one year as short-\nterm based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nCash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair market value. The Company’s short-term and long-\nterm debt investments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are stated at their fair market value, with\nunrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets. Premiums and discounts on debt investments are generally amortized or accreted over the life of the\nrelated available-for-sale securities. Interest income is recognized when earned. The cost of investments sold is\ndetermined on the basis of the specific identification method.\nAvailable-for-sale investments are subject to impairment reviews when the fair value is below the amortized\ncost basis. If the Company determines that the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to\ncredit-related factors, the impairment is recognized as an allowance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a\ncorresponding adjustment to earnings. An impairment that is not credit-related is recognized in accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company intends to sell the impaired investments,\nor more likely than not will be required to sell such investments before recovering the amortized cost basis, the\nentire impairment amount is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis.\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values are accounted for under\nthe measurement alternative method, provided that the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence or control over the investees. Under this method, the Company measures the investments at cost,\nless any impairment, and adjusts the carrying value of the investments to fair value resulting from observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The Company records the investments in other\nlong-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and gains and losses on the investments are recognized in\nother income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company monitors its non-marketable equity investments for impairment indicators, such as negative\nchanges in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events\nand factors. If indicators exist for a security and the fair value is below the carrying amount, the Company writes\ndown the security to fair value.\n56\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value, the\nCompany considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact, as well as\nassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities. Fair value is estimated by\napplying the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases\nthe categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair\nvalue measurement. See Note 4 for additional information on the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (which approximates actual cost determined on a first-in first-\nout basis) and estimated net realizable value. The Company writes down excess and obsolete inventories based\non their age and forecasted demand, which includes estimates taking into consideration the Company’s revenue\nforecast, outlook on market and economic conditions, technology changes, new product introductions and\nchanges in strategic direction. Actual demand may differ from forecasted demand, and such a difference may\nhave a material effect on recorded inventory values. When the Company records a write-down on inventory, it\nestablishes a new, lower cost basis for that inventory, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances will not\nresult in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation commences when an asset is placed in service and\navailable for its intended use. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets. Buildings and building improvements have estimated useful lives of 20 to 40 years. Leasehold\nimprovements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease period. Production\nequipment, lab equipment and software have estimated useful lives of three to eight years. Transportation\nequipment has estimated useful lives of 5 to 20 years. Furniture and fixtures have estimated useful lives of three\nto five years. Land is not depreciated.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would\nbe recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the\nasset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. Such impairment loss would be measured as\nthe difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value based on the present value of estimated\nfuture cash flows. The Company did not record material impairments in any of the periods presented.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and\nidentified intangible assets as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized.\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company has elected to first\nassess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value\nof the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed\nto measure the impairment loss. No impairment of goodwill has been identified in any of the periods presented.\n57\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nThe Company has a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan, which provides certain key employees,\nincluding executive officers, with the ability to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for\nretirement on a tax deferred basis. The Company does not make contributions to the plan or guarantee returns on\nthe investments. The Company is responsible for the plan’s administrative expenses. Participants’ deferrals and\ninvestment gains and losses remain as the Company’s liabilities and the underlying assets are subject to claims\nof general creditors.\nThe liabilities for compensation deferred under the plan are recorded at fair value as of the end of each reporting\nperiod. Changes in the fair value of the liabilities are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. The Company manages the risk of changes in the fair value of the liabilities by electing\nto match the liabilities with investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies, mutual funds and money\nmarket funds that offset a substantial portion of the exposure. The investments are recorded at the cash surrender\nvalue of the corporate-owned life insurance policies, and at the fair value of the mutual funds and money market\nfunds, which are classified as trading securities. Changes in the cash surrender value of the corporate-owned\nlife insurance policies and the fair value of mutual fund and money market fund investments are included in\nother income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the\ndeferred compensation plan balances on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred compensation plan asset components:\nCash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies ...... $ 23,545 $ 19,089\nFair value of mutual funds and money market funds ............... 54,836 43,933\nTotal ........................................................ $ 78,381 $ 63,022\nDeferred compensation plan assets reported in:\nOther long-term assets ....................................... $ 78,381 $ 63,022\nDeferred compensation plan liabilities reported in:\nAccrued compensation and related benefits (short-term) ............ $ 384 $ 118\nOther long-term liabilities .................................... 80,903 64,863\nTotal ........................................................ $ 81,287 $ 64,981\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of promised goods or services to its customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nSee Note 2 for further discussion.\nR&D\nCosts incurred in R&D are expensed as incurred.\nWarranty Reserve\nThe Company generally provides either a one- or two-year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship\nand will repair the products, provide replacements at no charge to customers or issue a refund. As they are considered\nassurance-type warranties, the Company does not account for them as separate performance obligations. Warranty\nreserve requirements are generally based on a specific assessment of the products sold with warranties when a\ncustomer asserts a claim for warranty or a product defect.\n58\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease terms may include options to extend or\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease right-\nof-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and operating\nlease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating\nlease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining\nlease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease\npayments, less lease incentives received. Because the implicit rate in each lease is not readily determinable, the\nCompany uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the remaining lease\npayment. The Company recognizes operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company does not record short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less at the commencement date on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. For lease arrangements that contain lease and non-lease components, the Company\naccounts for them as single lease components.\nFor lease arrangements where the Company is the lessor, the Company recognizes lease income from operating\nleases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments\nbased on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of RSUs with only service conditions is determined\nbased on the grant date stock price. The fair value of all other awards is determined based on the following\nvaluation methods:\nType of Awards Valuation Method\nRSUs with performance conditions (“PSUs”) that have a purchase\nprice adjustment Monte Carlo simulation model\nRSUs with market conditions (“MSUs”) Monte Carlo simulation model\nRSUs with both performance and market conditions (“MPSUs”) Monte Carlo simulation model\nShares issued under the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) Black-Scholes model\nThe valuation models consider inputs including stock price, expected volatility, expected term of awards, risk-\nfree interest rate, and expected dividend yield. Expected volatility used in the models is determined based on\nhistorical volatility of the Company’s stock price for the period, which corresponds to the expected term of the\nawards, immediately preceding the granting of the awards.\nCompensation expense related to awards with service conditions is recorded on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period. Compensation expense related to awards subject to performance or market conditions\nis recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche. For awards with only market\nconditions, compensation expense is not reversed if the market conditions are not satisfied. For awards with only\nperformance conditions, as well as awards containing both market and performance conditions, the Company\nrecognizes compensation expense when it becomes probable that the performance goals will be achieved.\nManagement performs the probability assessment on a quarterly basis by reviewing external factors, such as\nmacroeconomic conditions and the analog industry revenue forecasts, and internal factors, such as the Company’s\nbusiness and operational objectives and revenue forecasts. Changes in the probability assessment of achievement\nof the performance conditions are accounted for in the period of change by recording a cumulative catch-up\nadjustment as if the new estimate had been applied since the service inception date. Any previously recognized\ncompensation expense is reversed if the performance conditions are not expected to be satisfied as a result of\nmanagement’s assessment.\nThe Company accounts for forfeitures of equity awards when they occur.\n59\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nThe Company recognizes federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on its estimate of taxes\npayable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. The Company also recognizes federal, state and\nforeign deferred tax assets or liabilities for its estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences\nand carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount\nof any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nThe Company’s calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and\njudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. The Company’s\nestimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based on, in part, added certainty, finality\nor uncertainty to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions\nwhere the Company operates, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, the Company recognizes\nliabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax for uncertain income tax positions taken on its tax returns if\nit has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. If the Company determines that payment of these amounts\nis unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than its current assessment, the Company may be required to\nrecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in its financial statements in the period such\ndetermination is made. The Company has calculated its uncertain tax positions which were attributable to certain\nestimates and judgments.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nThe Company is a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including challenges\nto the enforceability or validity of its intellectual property, claims that the Company’s products infringe on the\nintellectual property rights of others, and employment matters. The Company may also be subject to litigation\ninitiated by its stockholders. The pending proceedings involve complex questions of fact and law and will require\nthe expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. In addition, from\ntime to time, the Company becomes aware that it is subject to other contingent liabilities. When this occurs, the\nCompany will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities to determine whether\na contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, management may, depending on the\nnature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the facts and\ncircumstances in each matter, the Company uses its judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent\nloss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated. If the Company determines a loss is\nprobable and estimable, the Company records a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss,\nthe Company takes into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal\nproceedings, settlement negotiations, prior case history and other factors. Should the judgments and estimates\nmade by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available, the Company may need\nto record additional contingent losses. Alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are\nadjusted, for example, if a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed.\nNet Income per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of\ncommon stock outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that would\noccur if outstanding securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into shares\nof common stock, and calculated using the treasury stock method. Contingently issuable shares, including equity\nawards with performance conditions or market conditions, are considered outstanding shares of common stock\nand included in the basic net income per share as of the date that all necessary conditions to earn the awards have\nbeen satisfied. Prior to the end of the contingency period, the number of contingently issuable shares included in\nthe diluted net income per share is based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable under the terms\nof the arrangement at the end of the reporting period.\n60\nThe Company’s RSUs contain forfeitable rights to receive cash dividend equivalents, which are accumulated and\npaid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents accumulated on the underlying RSUs\nare forfeited if the employees do not fulfill the requisite service requirement and, as a result, the awards do not vest.\nAccordingly, these awards are not treated as participating securities in the net income per share calculation.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income represents the change in the Company’s net assets during the period from non-owner\nsources. Accumulated other comprehensive loss presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily consists\nof unrealized gains or losses related to available-for-sale investments and foreign currency translation adjustments.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nfrom Contracts with Customers. The guidance requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and\ncontract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\n606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. The Company adopted this\nguidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2023 prospectively and it did not impact the consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its\nrecent acquisition but does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 17 for\nadditional information regarding this acquisition.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted as of December 31, 2023\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, which aims to improve disclosures regarding a public entity’s reportable segments, primarily\nthrough more comprehensive disclosures around significant segment expenses. The guidance will be effective for\nthe annual reporting for fiscal year 2024 and interim reporting for the first quarter in 2025, and should be applied\nretroactively to all prior periods presented. The Company is evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures, which aims to improve an entity’s income tax disclosures around its effective rate reconciliation,\nincome taxes paid, disaggregation of income before income taxes and income tax expense. The guidance will be\neffective for annual reporting for fiscal year 2025. The standard should be applied prospectively and retrospective\napplication is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on\nits consolidated financial statements.\n2. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue from Product Sales\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from product sales, which include assembled and tested ICs, as well as\ndies in wafer form. These product sales accounted for 99%, 98% and 97% of the Company’s total revenue for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The remaining revenue primarily includes royalty\nrevenue from licensing arrangements and revenue from wafer testing services performed for third parties, which\nhave not been significant for the periods presented. See Note 15 for the disaggregation of the Company’s revenue\nby geographic region and by product family.\nThe Company sells its products primarily through third-party distributors, value-added resellers, OEMs, ODMs\nand EMS providers. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 80%, 83% and 88%, respectively,\nof the Company’s product sales were made through distribution arrangements. These distribution arrangements\ncontain enforceable rights and obligations specific to those distributors and not the end customers. Purchase\n61\norders, which are generally governed by sales agreements or the Company’s standard terms of sale, set the final\nterms for unit price, quantity, shipping and payment agreed between the Company and the customer. The Company\nconsiders purchase orders to be the contracts with customers. The unit price as stated on the purchase orders is\nconsidered the observable, stand-alone selling price for the arrangements.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the\npromised goods or services to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects\nto be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company excludes taxes assessed by government\nauthorities, such as sales taxes, from revenue.\nProduct sales consist of a single performance obligation that the Company satisfies at a point in time. The\nCompany recognizes product revenue from distributors and direct end customers when the following events have\noccurred: (a) the Company has transferred physical possession of the products, (b) the Company has a present\nright to payment, (c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears significant risks and\nrewards of ownership of the products. In accordance with the shipping terms specified in the contracts, these\ncriteria are generally met when the products are shipped from the Company’s facilities (such as the “Ex Works”\nshipping term) or delivered to the customers’ locations (such as the “Delivered Duty Paid” shipping term).\nUnder certain consignment agreements, revenue is not recognized when the products are shipped and delivered\nto be held at customers’ designated locations because the Company continues to control the products and retain\nownership, and the customers do not have an unconditional obligation to pay. The Company recognizes revenue\nwhen the customers consume the products from the consigned inventory locations or at which time control\ntransfers to the customers and the Company invoices them for payment.\nVariable Consideration\nThe Company accounts for price adjustments and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the\ntransaction price and recognizes that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized. Certain\nU.S.-based distributors have price adjustment rights when they sell the Company’s products to their end\ncustomers at a price that is lower than the distribution price invoiced by the Company. When the Company\nreceives claims from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers at the lower prices,\nthe Company issues the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments. The Company estimates the price\nadjustments using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical claims, at both the distributor and\nproduct level, as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix. Other U.S. distributors and non-\nU.S. distributors do not have price adjustment rights. The Company records a credit against accounts receivable\nfor the estimated price adjustments, with a corresponding reduction to revenue.\nCertain distributors have limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percentage of the\nprevious six months’ purchases in accordance with the contract terms. The Company estimates the stock rotation\nreturns using the expected value method based on an analysis of historical returns, and the current level of inventory\nin the distribution channel. The Company records a liability for the stock rotation reserve, with a corresponding\nreduction to revenue. In addition, the Company recognizes an asset for product returns which represents the\nright to recover products from the customers related to stock rotations, with a corresponding reduction to cost\nof revenue.\nContract Balances\nAccounts Receivable:\nThe Company records a receivable when it has an unconditional right to receive consideration after the performance\nobligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accounts receivable totaled $179.9 million and\n$182.7 million, respectively. The Company’s accounts receivable are short-term, with standard payment terms\ngenerally ranging from 30 to 90 days. The Company did not recognize any write-offs of accounts receivable or\nrecord any allowance for credit losses for the periods presented.\n62\nContract Liabilities:\nFor certain customers located in Asia, the Company requires cash payments two weeks before the products\nare scheduled to be shipped to the customers. The Company records these payments received in advance of\nperformance as customer prepayments within current accrued liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, customer prepayments totaled $2.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The decrease in the customer\nprepayment balance for the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted from a decrease in unfulfilled customer\norders for which the Company had received payments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\nrecognized substantially all of the revenue that was included in the customer prepayment balance as of December\n31, 2022.\nPractical Expedients\nThe Company has elected the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as incurred because the\namortization period would have been one year or less.\nThe Company’s standard payment terms generally require customers to pay 30 to 90 days after the Company\nsatisfies the performance obligations. For those customers who are required to pay in advance, the Company\nsatisfies the performance obligations generally within a quarter. For these reasons, the Company has elected not to\ndetermine whether contracts with customers contain significant financing components.\nThe Company’s unsatisfied performance obligations primarily include products held in consignment arrangements\nand customer purchase orders for products that the Company has not yet shipped. Because the Company expects\nto fulfill these performance obligations within one year, the Company has elected not to disclose the amount of\nthese remaining performance obligations.\n3.

As of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not consider the impairment of its investments to be a result of credit\nlosses. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the\npotential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment\ngrade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. When evaluating a debt security for impairment,\nmanagement reviews factors such as the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be\nrequired to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the extent to which the fair value of the\nsecurity is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and the credit quality of the investment.\nNon-Marketable Equity Investment\nIn November 2020, the Company made an equity investment in a privately held Swiss company (the “Investee”)\nthat is accounted for under the measurement alternative. In April 2022, the Company made an additional investment\nin the form of a convertible loan. One member of the Board of Directors was an executive officer of a company\nthat has a commercial relationship with the Investee. In addition, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer had a\npersonal investment in the Investee and was on the Investee’s Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022, the\nCompany’s investment in the Investee, which is denominated in Swiss Franc, had a carrying value of $5.4 million.\nIn May 2023, the Company sold all its investments in the Investee for $7.4 million and recorded a gain of $1.4\nmillion, which was included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRestricted Cash\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets to the amounts reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents ....................................... $ 527,843 $ 288,607\nRestricted cash included in other current assets ....................... 33,204 —\nRestricted cash included in other long-term assets ..................... 134 122\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows ......................... $ 561,181 $ 288,729\nAs of December 31, 2023, restricted cash included in other current assets was related to preliminary purchase\nconsideration held in a trust account in connection with the Company’s recent acquisition. See Note 17 for\nadditional information. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, restricted cash included in other long-term assets was\nrelated to a security deposit that is set aside in a bank account and cannot be withdrawn by the Company under\nthe terms of a lease agreement. The restriction will end upon the expiration of the lease.\n65\n4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe Company has estimated the fair value of its financial assets by applying the following hierarchy, which\nprioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy\nupon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\n• Level 1—includes instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\n• Level 2—includes instruments for which the valuations are based upon quoted market prices in\nactive markets involving similar assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the\nassets. The market inputs used to value these instruments generally consist of market yields, recently\nexecuted transactions, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of\nprice transparency. Pricing sources may include industry standard data providers, security master\nfiles from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources used to determine a daily market value.\n• Level 3—includes instruments for which the valuations are based on inputs that are unobservable and\nsignificant to the overall fair value measurement.\nFinancial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table details the fair value of the financial assets measured on a recurring basis (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nMoney market funds ........................ $ 135,514 $ 135,514 $ — $ —\nCertificates of deposit ....................... 127,123 — 127,123 —\nCorporate debt securities ..................... 95,101 — 95,101 —\nU.S. treasuries and government agency bonds .... 358,409 — 358,409 —\nAuction-rate securities backed by\nstudent-loan notes ...................... 567 — — 567\nMutual funds and money market funds under\ndeferred compensation plan ............... 54,836 54,836 — —\nTotal .................................... $ 771,550 $ 190,350 $ 580,633 $ 567\nDecember 31, 2022\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nMoney market funds ........................ $ 15,462 $ 15,462 $ — $ —\nCertificates of deposit ....................... 130,467 — 130,467 —\nCorporate debt securities ..................... 292,586 — 292,586 —\nCommercial paper .......................... 17,928 — 17,928 —\nU.S. treasuries and government agency bonds .... 8,285 — 8,285 —\nAuction-rate securities backed by\nstudent-loan notes ...................... 1,711 — — 1,711\nMutual funds and money market funds under\ndeferred compensation plan ............... 43,933 43,933 — —\nTotal .................................... $ 510,372 $ 59,395 $ 449,266 $ 1,711\nRedemptions and changes in the fair value of the auction-rate securities classified as Level 3 assets were not\nmaterial for the periods presented.\n66\n5.

As of December 31, 2023, the total intrinsic value of\nall outstanding RSUs was $1.3 billion, based on the closing stock price of $630.78. As of December 31, 2023,\nunamortized compensation expense related to all outstanding RSUs was $232.6 million with a weighted-average\nremaining recognition period of approximately two years.\nCash proceeds from vested PSUs with a purchase price totaled $1.1 million, $5.4 million and $17.3 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTime-Based RSUs\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Compensation Committee granted 51,000, 49,000\nand 46,000 RSUs, respectively, with service conditions to non-executive employees and non-employee directors.\nThe RSUs generally vest over four years for employees and one year for directors, subject to continued service\nwith the Company.\nPSUs and MPSUs\n2023 PSUs:\nIn February 2023, the Compensation Committee granted 69,000 PSUs to the executive officers, which represent\na target number of shares that can be earned based on the degree of achievement of two sets of performance goals\n(“2023 Executive PSUs”). For the first goal, the executive officers can earn up to 300% of the target number of\nthe 2023 Executive PSUs based on the achievement of the Company’s average three-year (2023 through 2025)\n71\nrevenue growth rate in excess of the analog industry’s average three-year revenue growth rate as published by\nthe Semiconductor Industry Association (the “SIA”). For the second goal, the executive officers can earn up\nto an additional 200% of the target number of the 2023 Executive PSUs if the Company secures additional\nmanufacturing capacity outside China during a three-year performance period. For both goals, a percentage of the\n2023 Executive PSUs will fully vest on December 31, 2025, depending on the degree to which the pre-determined\ngoals are met during the performance periods. Assuming the achievement of the highest level of the performance\ngoals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2023 Executive PSUs is $156.2 million.\nIn February 2023, the Compensation Committee granted 13,000 PSUs to certain non-executive employees, which\nrepresent a target number of shares that can be earned based on the degree of achievement of the Company’s 2024\nrevenue goals for certain regions or product line divisions, or based on the degree of achievement of the Company’s\naverage two-year (2023 and 2024) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry’s average two-year\nrevenue growth rate as published by the SIA (“2023 Non-Executive PSUs”). The maximum number of shares that\nan employee can earn is either 200% or 300% of the target number of the 2023 Non-Executive PSUs, depending\non the job classification of the employee. 50% of the 2023 Non-Executive PSUs will vest in the first quarter of\n2025 depending on the degree to which the pre-determined goals are met during the performance period. The\nremaining 2023 Non-Executive PSUs will vest over the following two years on a quarterly basis. Assuming the\nachievement of the highest level of performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2023 Non-\nExecutive PSUs is $13.8 million.\nThe 2023 Executive PSUs and the 2023 Non-Executive PSUs contain a purchase price feature, which requires the\nemployees to pay the Company $30 per share upon vesting of the shares. The $30 purchase price requirement is\ndeemed satisfied and waived if the Company’s stock price on the last trading day of the performance period is $30\nhigher than the grant date stock price of $467.62. The Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2023\nExecutive PSUs and the 2023 Non-Executive PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following\nassumptions: stock price of $467.62, simulation term of four years, expected volatility of 51.0%, risk-free interest\nrate of 3.9%, and expected dividend yield of 0.9%. There is no illiquidity discount because the awards do not\ncontain any post-vesting sales restrictions.\n2022 PSUs:\nIn February 2022, the Compensation Committee granted 81,000 PSUs to the executive officers, which represented\na target number of shares that could be earned subject to the achievement of two sets of performance goals (“2022\nExecutive PSUs”). For the first goal, the executive officers could earn up to 300% of the target number of the\n2022 Executive PSUs based on the achievement of the Company’s average two-year (2022 and 2023) revenue\ngrowth rate compared against the analog industry’s average two-year revenue growth rate as published by the\nSIA. 50% of the 2022 Executive PSUs would vest in the first quarter of 2024 if the pre-determined revenue goal\nwas met during the performance period. The remaining 2022 Executive PSUs would vest over the following two\nyears on a quarterly basis. For the second goal, the executive officers could earn up to an additional 200% of the\ntarget number of the 2022 Executive PSUs if the Company secured additional wafer capacity during a three-year\nperformance period. The 2022 Executive PSUs related to the second goal would fully vest in the first quarter of\n2025 if the pre-determined goal was met during the performance period. In addition, all vested shares related to\nthe second goal would be subject to a post-vesting sales restriction period of one year. Assuming the achievement\nof the highest level of the performance goals, the total stock-based compensation cost for the 2022 Executive\nPSUs would be $142.7 million. The 2022 Executive PSUs were subsequently cancelled by the Board of Directors\nin October 2022. See the “2022 MSUs” section for further details.\nIn February 2022, the Compensation Committee granted 14,000 PSUs to certain non-executive employees, which\nrepresented a target number of shares that could be earned subject to the achievement of the Company’s 2023\nrevenue goals for certain regions or product line divisions, or based on the achievement of the Company’s average\ntwo-year (2022 and 2023) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry’s average two-year revenue\ngrowth rate as published by the SIA (“2022 Non-Executive PSUs”). The maximum number of shares that an\nemployee could earn was either 200% or 300% of the target number of the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs, depending\non the job classification of the employee. Based on the actual revenue achievement at the end of the performance\nperiod, a total of 29,000 shares were awarded to the non-executive employees. 50% of the 2022 Non-Executive\n72\nPSUs will vest in the first quarter of 2024. The remaining 2022 Non-Executive PSUs will vest over the following\ntwo years on an annual or quarterly basis. Based on the actual achievement of the performance goals, the total\nstock-based compensation cost for the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs is $11.1 million.\nThe 2022 Executive PSUs and the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs contained a purchase price feature, which required the\nemployees to pay the Company $30 per share upon vesting of the shares. The $30 purchase price requirement\nwas deemed satisfied and waived if the average stock price for 20 consecutive trading days at any time during\n2022 and 2023 was $30 higher than the grant date stock price of $393.16. This market condition was achieved\nin the first quarter of 2022. The Company determined the grant date fair value of the 2022 Executive PSUs\nfor the first goal and the 2022 Non-Executive PSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following\nassumptions: stock price of $393.16, simulation term of four years, expected volatility of 44.6%, risk-free interest\nrate of 1.5%, and expected dividend yield of 0.8%. In addition, for the 2022 Executive PSUs related to the second\ngoal, the fair value was determined based on the closing stock price at the end of each reporting period, adjusted\nfor accrued dividends and an illiquidity discount of 10.3% to account for the post-vesting sales restrictions.\n2021 PSUs:\nIn February 2021, the Compensation Committee granted 80,000 PSUs to the executive officers, which represented\na target number of shares that could be earned subject to the achievement of two sets of performance goals (“2021\nExecutive PSUs”).

As of December 31, 2023, all three environmental objectives were achieved and a\ntotal of 80,000 shares were awarded to the executive officers. The 2021 Executive PSUs related to the ESG goal\nfully vested upon achievement of the objectives. All vested shares related to the ESG goal are subject to a post-\nvesting sales restriction period of one year. Based on the actual achievement of the performance goals, the total\nstock-based compensation cost for the 2021 Executive PSUs is $114.4 million.\nIn February 2021, the Compensation Committee granted 14,000 PSUs to certain non-executive employees, which\nrepresented a target number of shares that could be earned subject to the achievement of the Company’s 2022\nrevenue goals for certain regions or product line divisions, or based on the achievement of the Company’s average\ntwo-year (2021 and 2022) revenue growth rate compared against the analog industry’s average two-year revenue\ngrowth rate as published by the SIA (“2021 Non-Executive PSUs”).

STOCKHOLDER’ EQUITY\nCash Dividend Program\nThe Company has a dividend program approved by the Board of Directors, pursuant to which the Company intends\nto pay quarterly cash dividends on its common stock. Based on the Company’s historical practice, stockholders\nof record as of the last business day of the quarter are entitled to receive the quarterly cash dividends when and if\ndeclared by the Board of Directors, which are payable to the stockholders in the following month.

The Company also\nanticipates that earnings from other foreign subsidiaries will continue to be indefinitely reinvested.\nCash Dividend Equivalent Rights\nThe Company’s RSUs contain rights to receive cash dividend equivalents, which entitle employees who\nhold RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. The dividend equivalents are\naccumulated and paid to the employees when the underlying RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents accumulated on the\nunderlying RSUs are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill the requisite service requirement and, as a result, the\nawards do not vest. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accrued dividend equivalents totaled $11.9 million\nand $13.8 million, respectively.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn October 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to\nrepurchase up to $640.0 million in the aggregate of its common stock through October 29, 2026.

The Company repurchased approximately 7,000 shares of its common stock for an aggregate\npurchase price of $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nStock repurchased under the program may be made through open market repurchases, privately negotiated\ntransactions or other structures in accordance with applicable state and federal securities laws, at times and in\namounts as management deems appropriate. The timing and the number of any repurchased common stock will\nbe determined by the Company’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions, legal requirements,\nshare price, and other factors. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase any particular\nnumber of shares and may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nThe U.S. IRA requires a 1% excise tax of the value of certain stock repurchases in excess of stock issued\nfor employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. This provision did not have an impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\n77\n9.

The\nrealizability of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient future\ntaxable income during periods prior to the expiration of tax attributes to fully utilize these assets. As of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has evaluated the realization of its deferred tax assets and recorded a valuation\nallowance for assets that do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of valuation allowances is as follows (in thousands):\nBalance at\nBeginning of Balance at\nPeriod Period Additions Reductions End of Period\nYear ended December 31, 2021 ................ $ 18,190 $ 1,560 $ (230) $ 19,520\nYear ended December 31, 2022 ................ $ 19,520 $ 1,743 $ (942) $ 20,321\nYear ended December 31, 2023 ................ $ 20,321 $ 15,405 $ (718) $ 35,008\nThe additions in 2023 were primarily the result of a change in foreign tax law in 2023 that negatively impacted\nthe realizability of foreign deferred tax assets.\nUndistributed Earnings of Subsidiaries:\nThe Company has analyzed its global working capital and cash requirements, and has determined that it plans to\nrepatriate cash from its Bermuda subsidiary on an ongoing basis to fund its future U.S.-based expenditures and\ndividends. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2021, the Company repatriated $140.0 million and $70.0\nmillion from its Bermuda subsidiary, respectively. No cash was repatriated from the subsidiary during the year\nended December 31, 2022.\nFor all other foreign subsidiaries, the Company expects to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings\nto fund their operations and R&D. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the undistributed earnings\nwere approximately $85.0 million and $67.4 million, respectively. An actual repatriation of the undistributed\nearnings could be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. The Company expects to\nbe able to take a dividend received deduction to offset any U.S. federal income tax liability on the undistributed\nearnings. Determination of the unrecognized state and withholding deferred tax liability is not practicable at this\ntime due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.\nOther Income Tax Provision Matters\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have federal net operating loss carryforwards. As of December\n31, 2023, the state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $3.6 million, which will expire\nbeginning in 2029. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards for\nincome tax purposes of $92.7 million, which will expire beginning in 2029.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no R&D tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes,\nand $40.6 million for state income tax purposes, which can be carried forward indefinitely.\nIn the event of a change in ownership, as defined under federal and state tax laws, the Company’s net operating\nloss and tax credit carryforwards could be subject to annual limitations. The annual limitations could result in the\nexpiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards prior to utilization.\n80\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $62.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $48.9 million of which\nwould affect its effective tax rate if recognized after considering the valuation allowance. As of December 31,\n2022, the Company had $49.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, $38.3 million of which would affect its\neffective tax rate if recognized after considering the valuation allowance.\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nBalance as of January 1, 2021 ................................................... $ 33,499\nIncrease for tax position of current year ....................................... 9,191\nDecrease for tax position of prior year ........................................

(1,926)\nDecrease for tax positions of prior year ........................................ (1,008)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 ................................................ $ 62,660\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in its income tax provision.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has $5.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of accrued\ninterest related to uncertain tax positions, which were recorded in income tax liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nUncertain tax positions relate to the allocation of income and deductions among the Company’s global entities\nand to the determination of the R&D tax credit. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized\ntax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. However, it is not possible to determine either the\nmagnitude or the range of increases or decreases at this time.\nThe Company currently has reduced tax rates in its subsidiaries in Chengdu and Hangzhou, China through\n2026 and 2024, respectively, for performing R&D activities.\nOn December 27, 2023, the Bermuda CIT Act was enacted and signed into law. It includes a 15% CIT applicable\nto Bermuda businesses that are MNE with annual revenue of €750M or more beginning in 2025. The Bermuda\nCIT Act also includes an ETA that requires MNE’s to revalue their assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, at\ntheir fair value as of September 30, 2023. There is an election to opt out of the ETA. As the Bermuda CIT Act is\nnot effective until January 1, 2025, the Company is evaluating whether or not to adopt this ETA. Based on the\ninformation available, the Company has not recorded any changes to income tax expense related to the Bermuda\nCIT Act as of December 31, 2023.\nOn August 9, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS Act to provide certain financial and tax incentives\nto the semiconductor industry, primarily for manufacturing activities within the United States. On August 16,\n2022, the IRA was enacted and signed into law. The IRA, among other things, introduces a new 15% corporate\nminimum tax, based on adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, and imposes a 1%\nexcise tax on certain stock repurchases. This excise tax is effective January 1, 2023. The CHIPS Act and the IRA\nhad no material impact on the income tax provisions, results of operations or financial condition of the Company\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n81\nIncome Tax Examination\nThe Company is subject to examination of its income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. In general,\nthe tax years for 2007 and forward are open for examination for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWarranty and Indemnification Provisions\nThe changes in warranty reserves are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of period ............................ $ 24,082 $ 20,989 $ 6,895\nWarranties issued ...................................... 2,929 3,092 10,558\nRepairs, replacement and refund ...........................

(7,397) 2,358 5,306\nBalance at end of period ................................. $ 16,906 $ 24,082 $ 20,989\nChanges in liability for pre-existing warranties result from changes in estimates for warranties issued in\nprior periods.\nThe Company provides indemnification agreements to certain direct or indirect customers. The Company agrees\nto reimburse these parties for any damages, costs and expenses incurred by them as a result of legal actions\ntaken against them by third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights as a result of using the\nCompany’s products and technologies. These indemnification provisions are varied in scope and are subject to\ncertain terms, conditions, limitations and exclusions. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification\nagreements with its directors and officers.\nIt is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to\nthe limited history of indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular\nagreement. There were no indemnification liabilities incurred for the periods presented. However, there can be no\nassurances that the Company will not incur any financial liabilities in the future as a result of these obligations.\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company has outstanding purchase obligations with its suppliers and other parties that require the purchases\nof goods or services. The purchase obligations primarily consist of wafer and other inventory purchases, assembly\nand other manufacturing services, construction of manufacturing and R&D facilities, purchases of production and\nother equipment, and license arrangements.\nIn May 2022, the Company entered into a long-term supply agreement in order to secure manufacturing production\ncapacity for silicon wafers over a four-year period. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had remaining\nprepayments under this agreement of $120.0 million reported in other long-term assets on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet.\nTotal estimated future unconditional purchase commitments to all suppliers and other parties, net of the\n$120.0 million prepayment, as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\n2024 ....................................................................... $ 367,842\n2025 ....................................................................... 298,958\n2026 ....................................................................... 1,668\n2027 ....................................................................... 31,266\nTotal ...................................................................... $ 699,734\n82\nLitigation\nThe Company is a party to actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including challenges\nto the enforceability or validity of its intellectual property, claims that the Company’s products infringe on the\nintellectual property rights of others, and employment matters. The Company may also be subject to litigation\ninitiated by its stockholders. These proceedings often involve complex questions of fact and law and may require\nthe expenditure of significant funds and the diversion of other resources to prosecute and defend. The Company\ndefends itself vigorously against any such claims. As of December 31, 2023, there were no material pending legal\nproceedings to which the Company was a party.\n13. EMPLOYEE 401(k) PLAN\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement savings plan for all employees in the U.S. who meet certain eligibility\nrequirements. Participants may contribute up to the amount allowable as a deduction for federal income tax\npurposes. The Company is not required to contribute and did not contribute to the plan for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n14. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS\nThe Company sells its products primarily through third-party distributors and value-added resellers, and directly\nto OEMs, ODMs and EMS providers. The following table summarizes those customers with sales equal to 10% or\nmore of the Company’s total revenue:\nYear Ended December 31,\nCustomer 2023 2022 2021\nDistributor A . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26% 24% 26%\nDistributor B .......................................... 19% 19% 15%\nDistributor C .......................................... 10% * 10%\n* Represents less than 10%.\nThe Company’s agreements with these third-party customers were made in the ordinary course of business\nand may be terminated with or without cause by these customers with advance notice. Although the\nCompany may experience a short-term disruption in the distribution of its products and a short-term decline in\nrevenue if its agreement with any of the distributors were terminated, the Company believes that such termination\nwould not have a material adverse effect on its financial statements because it would be able to engage alternative\ndistributors, resellers and other distribution channels to deliver its products to end customers within a short period\nfollowing any termination of the agreement with a distributor.\nThe following table summarizes those customers with accounts receivable equal to 10% or more of the Company’s\ntotal accounts receivable:\nCustomer 2023 2022\nDistributor A . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42% 29%\nDistributor B ...................................................... 13% 23%\nDistributor C ...................................................... 10% *\n* Represents less than 10%.\n15. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nThe Company operates in one reportable segment that includes the design, development, marketing and sale of\nhigh-performance, semiconductor-based power electronic solutions for the storage and computing, enterprise\ndata, automotive, industrial, communications and consumer markets. The Company’s chief operating decision\nmaker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the\n83\npurposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company derives a majority of its\nrevenue from sales to customers located outside North America, with geographic revenue based on the customers’\nship-to locations.\nThe following is a summary of revenue by geographic region (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCountry or Region 2023 2022 2021\nChina ......................................... $ 934,768 $ 938,946 $ 700,985\nTaiwan ........................................ 307,499 233,040 169,130\nSouth Korea ................................... 169,867 189,478 93,027\nEurope ........................................ 132,620 145,584 85,201\nUnited States ................................... 97,294 99,804 35,770\nJapan ......................................... 93,340 91,048 68,720\nSoutheast Asia .................................. 85,150 95,739 54,611\nOther ......................................... 534 509 354\nTotal ......................................... $ 1,821,072 $ 1,794,148 $ 1,207,798\nThe following is a summary of revenue by major product family (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nProduct Family 2023 2022 2021\nDC to DC ..................................... $ 1,718,623 $ 1,696,594 $ 1,147,329\nLighting Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 102,449 97,554 60,469\nTotal ......................................... $ 1,821,072 $ 1,794,148 $ 1,207,798\nThe following is a summary of long-lived assets by geographic region (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\nCountry 2023 2022 2021\nChina ......................................... $ 184,685 $ 200,508 $ 211,973\nUnited States ................................... 119,430 113,996 113,805\nTaiwan ........................................ 39,419 20,074 19,607\nOther ......................................... 25,418 22,579 17,577\nTotal ......................................... $ 368,952 $ 357,157 $ 362,962\n84\n16.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nAcquisition\nIn January 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Axign in a cash transaction in exchange for all\noutstanding Axign shares. Axign is a Dutch company that designs and develops class-D audio ICs, targeting\napplications ranging from portable consumer speakers to automotive and professional-grade multi-speaker\nsystems. The preliminary total purchase consideration was approximately $33.8 million. The initial accounting\nfor the acquisition, including the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is still ongoing as of the date\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K is issued.\nCash Dividend Increase\nIn February 2024, the Board of Directors approved an increase in quarterly cash dividends from $1.00 per share\nto $1.25 per share.\n85\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, and due to the finding of the material weakness described below, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in\nreports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within\nthe time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nNotwithstanding the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, management\nbelieves and has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the\nperiods presented in conformity with GAAP.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nDuring the year-end financial reporting process of fiscal 2023, management was informed of a material weakness\nin internal control over financial reporting within the Company’s demand forecast process regarding excess and\nobsolete inventory. The material weakness resulted from ineffective design of the controls related to management’s\nreview and documentation of the Company’s inventory demand information and other assumptions used to\ndetermine the inventory carrying value adjustments necessary to record such quantities at the lower of their cost\nor net realizable value.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated\nfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We do not believe that this material\nweakness resulted in any material errors.\nErnst & Young LLP independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as\nstated in the firm’s attestation report, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRemediation\nManagement has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control\ndeficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed,\nimplemented, and operating effectively. These remediation actions are ongoing and include or are expected\nto include:\n• Increased frequency of inventory reserve calculations and reconcile data between the inventory demand\nforecast system and our financial system at the same frequency;\n86\n• Amend inventory provision spreadsheet formats to include additional columns and color coding\nto delineate specific parts and products before and after review, setting dollar thresholds for reserve\nrequirements, and adding a tab for management review comments; and\n• Document discussions and proposed actions and follow-up at inventory demand forecast meetings.\nAs we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may decide to\ntake additional measures to address this identified deficiency or modify the remediation plans described above.\nWe believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness, however, the weakness will not be considered\nremediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded,\nthrough testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Management believes the foregoing plans will\neffectively remediate the deficiency constituting the material weakness and believes that the remediation of this\nmaterial weakness (including necessary testing) will be completed during 2024. However, there is no assurance\nas to when such remediation will be completed. As the remediation plans are implemented, management may take\nadditional measures or modify the remediation plan elements described above.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2023, that would have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting. However, the Company was informed of the material weakness described\nabove during the year-end financial reporting process of fiscal 2023 and has initiated enhancements to its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting to remediate that control deficiency.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the\ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints, and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nItem 9B. Other Information\n10b5-1 Trading Plans\nCertain of our executive officers have entered into trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended. A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices\nand dates (or formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our common\nstock, including the sale of shares acquired pursuant to the 2004 ESPP and the Amended 2004 ESPP, and upon\nvesting of RSUs. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer of the Company\nadopted, modified or terminated trading plans intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule\n10b5-1(c) as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, no\npre-existing trading plans intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) were modified\nor terminated, and no other written trading arrangements that are not intended to qualify for the Rule 10b5-1(c)\naffirmative defense were adopted, modified, or terminated.\nItem 9C.

It is convenient, and it\nsaves us significant postage and processing costs. In addition, when voting over the Internet or by telephone\nprior to the meeting date, your vote is recorded immediately, and there is no risk that postal delays will cause\nyour vote to arrive late, and therefore not be counted. All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly\nexecuted proxy cards or properly granted proxies submitted electronically over the Internet or telephone\nreceived prior to the Annual Meeting, and not revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with\nthe instructions provided. If no instructions are indicated, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted\nas recommended by the Board. If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual\nMeeting, including, among other things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the Annual Meeting to another\ntime or place (including, without limitation, for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies), the persons named\nas proxies and acting thereunder will have discretion to vote on those matters in accordance with their best\njudgment. We do not currently anticipate that any matters other than the proposals described herein will be\nraised at the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, trust or other\nnominee, you will receive a notice from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee that includes instructions\non how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank, trust or other nominee will allow you to deliver your voting\ninstructions over the Internet and may also permit you to submit your voting instructions by telephone.\nYOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.

Any proxy given by a stockholder of record pursuant to this\nsolicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting. Proxies\nsubmitted by stockholders of record may be revoked by:\n• filing a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the previously submitted proxy which is\nreceived by our Corporate Secretary at or before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting;\n• duly executing a later dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Corporate\nSecretary at or before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting;\n3\n• submitting another proxy by telephone or via the Internet (your latest telephone or Internet voting\ninstructions are followed); or\n• virtually attending and voting at the Annual Meeting (although attendance at the Annual Meeting will\nnot in and of itself constitute a revocation of a previously submitted proxy).\nAny written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy card must be received by our Corporate Secretary\nprior to the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. Such written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy\ncard must be submitted using the methods outlined in “Stockholder Communications.”\nIf you hold your shares through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, you may change your vote by\nsubmitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank, trust or other nominee.\nNo Right of Appraisal\nNeither Delaware law nor our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of\nIncorporation”) provide for appraisal or other similar rights for dissenting stockholders in connection with any\nof the proposals to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, our stockholders will have no right to\ndissent and obtain payment for their shares.\nExpenses of Solicitation\nWe will bear all expenses of this solicitation, including the cost of preparing and mailing this solicitation\nmaterial. We may reimburse brokerage firms, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other persons representing\nbeneficial owners of Common Stock for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to such\nbeneficial owners. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies in person or by telephone,\nletter, e-mail or other means of communication. Such directors, officers and employees will not be additionally\ncompensated, but they may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such\nsolicitation. We have engaged the services of a professional proxy solicitation firm to aid in the solicitation\nof proxies from certain brokers, bank nominees and other institutional owners. We expect our costs for such\nservices would be approximately $25,000.\nQuorum, Required Votes, Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes\nHolders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote must be present at the Annual Meeting\nin order to have the required quorum for the transaction of business. Stockholders are counted as present at\nthe Annual Meeting if they: (1) are duly registered to attend and vote their shares at the Annual Meeting, or\n(2) have properly submitted a proxy card by mail or voted by telephone or by using the Internet. If the shares\npresent at the Annual Meeting do not constitute the required quorum, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned to a\nsubsequent date for the purpose of obtaining a quorum.\nThe required votes to approve the proposals to be considered at this Annual Meeting are as follows:\n• The affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes duly cast is required for the election of directors. As\nfurther described in Proposal One below, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of\nvotes “Withheld” from his or her election than votes “For” his or her election will promptly tender his or\nher resignation to the Board following certification of the election results for the Board’s consideration.\n• The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in\nperson by virtual attendance at the Annual Meeting or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting is\nrequired to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) as our independent registered public\naccounting firm. While this vote is advisory and not binding on us or our Audit Committee, the Audit\nCommittee intends to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering the appointment\nof EY.\n4\n• The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in\nperson by virtual attendance at the Annual Meeting or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting is\nrequired to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. While\nthis vote is advisory and not binding on us or our Board, the Board and the Compensation Committee\nintend to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive\ncompensation arrangements.\n• The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in\nperson by virtual attendance at the Annual Meeting or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting is\nrequired to approve, on an advisory basis, the stockholder proposal to elect each director annually. While\nthis vote is advisory and not binding on us or our Board, the Board intends to take into account the\noutcome of the vote when considering the structure of the Board.\nUnder the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, both abstaining votes and broker non-votes\nare counted as present and entitled to vote and are, therefore, included for purposes of determining whether\na quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. An abstaining vote is not counted as a vote cast for the election\nof directors, but has the same effect as a vote cast against each of the other proposals requiring approval by a\nmajority of the shares of stock entitled to vote thereon which are present in person by virtual attendance at the\nAnnual Meeting or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee\nholding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not\nhave discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial\nowner. A broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of the proposals. For purposes of ratifying our\nindependent registered public accounting firm, brokers have discretionary authority to vote.\nStockholder List\nA list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for examination by any\nstockholder for any purpose germane to the Annual Meeting during ordinary business hours at: 5808 Lake\nWashington Boulevard NE, Kirkland, Washington 98033 for the ten days prior to the Annual Meeting, and will\nbe open to the examination of any stockholder of the Company during the whole time of the Annual Meeting.\n5\nPROPOSAL ONE\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nClassified Board of Directors and Nominees\nThe Board currently consists of eight members. Under our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,\nthe Board has the authority to set the number of directors from time to time by resolution. In addition, our\nCertificate of Incorporation provides for a classified Board consisting of three classes of directors, each serving\nstaggered three-year terms. As a result, a portion of the Board will be elected each year for three-year terms.\nThree Class II directors are to be elected to the Board at the Annual Meeting. Unless otherwise instructed,\nthe proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them for the Board’s nominees, Eugen Elmiger, Eileen\nWynne and Jeff Zhou. Mr. Elmiger, Ms. Wynne and Mr. Zhou are standing for re-election to the Board. Each\nperson nominated for election has agreed to serve if elected, and the Board has no reason to believe that any\nnominee will be unavailable or will decline to serve. In the event, however, that any nominee is unable or\ndeclines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for any nominee who\nis designated by the current Board to fill the vacancy. The term of office of each person elected as a Class II\ndirector will continue for three years or until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified. If elected,\nthe term for Mr. Elmiger, Ms. Wynne and Mr. Zhou will expire at the 2027 annual meeting of stockholders.\nOur directors are elected by a “plurality” vote. The nominees for each of the three Board seats to be voted\non at the Annual Meeting receiving the greatest number of votes cast will be elected. Abstentions and shares\nheld by brokers that are not voted in the election of directors will have no effect. In addition, we have adopted a\ncorporate governance policy requiring each director nominee to submit a resignation letter if more “Withheld”\nthan “For” votes are received.

Mr. Moyer brings insight to the Board\nbecause of his cumulative experience gained as an engineer and technical leader\nin the semiconductor industry.

Based on the Board’s identification of these qualifications, skills\nand experiences, the Board has concluded that Dr. Zhou should serve as a director\nof MPS.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe Board currently consists of eight members, seven of which the Board has determined are independent.\nLeadership Structure. Our current leadership structure and governing documents permit the roles of\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer to be filled by the same or different individuals. Should the Board\ndetermine that it remains in the best interests of MPS and its stockholders that the Chief Executive Officer serve\nas Chairman, the independent members of the Board then elect a Lead Independent Director.\nThe Board has currently determined that it is in the best interests of MPS and its stockholders to have\nMichael Hsing, our President and Chief Executive Officer, serve as Chairman, coupled with an active Lead\nIndependent Director. As such, Mr. Hsing holds the position of Chairman, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and the Board has designated one of the independent directors, Mr. Chang, as the Lead Independent\nDirector. Our Lead Independent Director is appointed by the Board on an annual basis. The Board believes our\nleadership structure, with its strong emphasis on Board independence, an active Lead Independent Director, and\nstrong Board and committee involvement, provides sound and robust oversight of management, and provides a\ncounterbalance to the management perspective provided by Mr. Hsing during Board deliberations.\nThe Board considers and discusses the Board leadership structure every year. As part of this evaluation\nprocess, the Board reviews its leadership structure and whether combining or separating the roles of Chairman\nand CEO is in the best interests of MPS and our stockholders. The Board also considers:\n• The effectiveness of the policies, practices and people in place at MPS to help ensure strong,\nindependent Board oversight;\n11\n• MPS’s performance and the effect the leadership structure could have on its performance;\n• The Board’s performance and the effect the leadership structure could have on the Board’s performance;\n• The Chairman’s performance in the role;\n• The views of MPS’s stockholders; and\n• The practices at other companies and trends in governance.\nWhile we recognize that different board leadership structures may be appropriate for different companies,\nwe believe that our current Board leadership structure is optimal for us. Our leadership structure demonstrates\nto our employees, suppliers, customers, stockholders and other stakeholders that we are governed by strong,\nbalanced leadership, with a single person setting the tone and consistent message for the Board and management\nand having primary responsibility for managing our day-to-day operations, with appropriate oversight and\ndirection from our Lead Independent Director and other independent directors. This message is increasingly\nimportant as we continue to seek to achieve success through new product releases and business growth. We\nalso believe that our leadership structure sends the message that we value strong, independent oversight of our\nmanagement operations and decisions in the form of our Lead Independent Director and other independent\ndirectors. Further, having a single leader for both MPS and the Board eliminates the potential for strategic\nmisalignment or duplication of efforts, and provides clear leadership for us.\nBenefits of Combined Leadership Structure. The Board believes that MPS and our stockholders have been\nbest served by having Mr. Hsing in the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for the following reasons:\n• Mr. Hsing is most familiar with our business and the unique challenges we face. Mr. Hsing’s day-to-day\ninsight into our challenges facilitates timely deliberation by the Board of important matters;\n• Mr. Hsing has and will continue to identify agenda items and lead effective discussions on the important\nmatters affecting us. Mr. Hsing’s knowledge and extensive experience regarding our operations and the\nhighly competitive semiconductor industry in which we compete position him to identify and prioritize\nmatters for Board review and deliberation;\n• As Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hsing serves as an important bridge between the\nBoard and management and provides critical leadership for carrying out our strategic initiatives and\nconfronting our challenges. The Board believes that Mr. Hsing brings a unique, stockholder-focused\ninsight to assist MPS to most effectively execute its strategy and business plans in the best interests of\nour stockholders;\n• The strength and effectiveness of the communications between Mr. Hsing, as our Chairman, and\nMr. Chang, as our Lead Independent Director, as well as our other independent directors, result in\ncomprehensive Board oversight of the issues, plans and prospects of MPS; and\n• This leadership structure provides the Board with more complete and timely information about\nMPS, a unified structure and consistent leadership direction internally and externally and provides a\ncollaborative and collegial environment for Board decision making.\nLead Independent Director Responsibilities. As the Lead Independent Director, Mr. Chang’s primary\nroles and responsibilities include:\n• Reviewing meeting agendas;\n• Reviewing schedules and information sent to the Board;\n• Retaining independent advisors on behalf of the Board, or committees, as the Board may determine is\nnecessary or appropriate;\n• Assuring that there is sufficient time for discussion of all meeting agenda items;\n• Consulting and communicating with independent directors and with the Chief Executive Officer/\nChairman of the Board, as appropriate;\n• Performing such other functions as the independent directors may designate from time to time;\n12\n• Presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions\nof the independent directors; and\n• Calling and leading meetings of independent directors.\nOur independent directors meet in executive session during a portion of regularly scheduled Board or\ncommittee meetings, and otherwise as needed. Our Lead Independent Director presides over meetings of our\nindependent directors and we believe that these meetings help to ensure an appropriate level of independent\nscrutiny of the functioning of MPS and the Board.\nBoard Meetings and Committees\nThe Board held a total of four meetings during 2023, and all directors attended at least 75% of the meetings\nof the Board and the committees upon which such director served.\nAudit Committee. The Board has a separately designated standing Audit Committee established in\naccordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act, which currently consists of four members: Herbert\nChang, Victor K.

The Board has designated a Compensation Committee consisting of three\nmembers: Herbert Chang, Eugen Elmiger and Jeff Zhou. Mr. Zhou is the chair of the Compensation Committee.\nIn April 2024, the Board appointed Mr. Elmiger to be the chair of the Compensation Committee, effective\nJune 13, 2024 after the Annual Meeting. The primary responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are to:\n• Provide oversight of our compensation policies, plans and benefits programs;\n• Assist the Board in the oversight of the compensation of the executive officers, and evaluation and\napproval of the executive officer compensation plans, policies and programs;\n• Assist the Board in administering our equity compensation plans; and\n• Provide oversight of our practices and compliance efforts with respect to executive compensation\npolicies and programs, as well as human capital management, under our environmental, social and\ngovernance (“ESG”) initiatives.\nAll members of the Compensation Committee are “independent” in accordance with the applicable listing\nstandards of NASDAQ. The Compensation Committee held four meetings during 2023. The Compensation\nCommittee acts pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board, which is available in the “Investor\nRelations” section of our website at http://www.monolithicpower.com.\nNCG Committee. The Board has designated an NCG Committee consisting of two members: Eugen\nElmiger and Carintia Martinez. Mr. Elmiger is the chair of the NCG Committee. In April 2024, the Board\n13\nappointed Ms. Martinez to be the chair of the NCG Committee, effective June 13, 2024 after the Annual\nMeeting. The primary responsibilities of the NCG Committee are to:\n• Review the composition and qualifications of the Board, recommend director nominees for the selection\nof the Board, and evaluate director compensation;\n• Review the composition of committees of the Board and recommend persons to be members of\nsuch committees;\n• Develop overall governance guidelines and oversee the overall performance of the Board, including the\nannual Board self-assessment;\n• Recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject a tendered director resignation, or take other\naction, in circumstances where a director receives a greater number of “withhold” votes than “for” votes\nin an uncontested election of directors as set forth in the director voting policy adopted by the Board;\n• Provide oversight of our practices, policies, strategies and disclosures respect to environmental\nsustainability issues, social initiatives and corporate governance; and\n• Provide oversight of our cybersecurity program, including policies, practices, internal controls and\nmanagement of information security risks.\nAll members of the NCG Committee are “independent” in accordance with the applicable listing standards\nof NASDAQ. The NCG Committee held four meetings in 2023. The NCG Committee acts pursuant to a\nwritten charter adopted by the Board, which is available in the “Investor Relations” section of our website\nat http://www.monolithicpower.com.\nThe information contained on our website is not intended to be part of this Proxy Statement and is not\nincorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement.\nBoard Oversight of Risks\nThe Board is primarily responsible for the oversight of risks that could affect MPS. The Board believes\nthat a fundamental part of risk management is understanding the risks that we face, monitoring these risks,\nand adopting appropriate controls and mitigation activities for such risks. We believe that the risk management\nareas that are critical to our long-term success primarily include product development, supply chain and quality,\nregulations and legal compliance, ESG, executive compensation programs, sales and promotions, and business\ndevelopment, as well as protection of our assets (financial, intellectual property and cybersecurity), all of\nwhich are managed by senior executive management reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer. Our\nBoard members have extensive experience in risk oversight arising from their current or prior experience as\nchief executive officers, chief financial officers, chief information officers, as well as other senior leadership\npositions or board members of other companies with responsibility for risk oversight obligations. As such, the\nBoard believes that its members are qualified and experienced at identifying and addressing risk throughout\nour operations.\nWhile the full Board has retained responsibility for general oversight of risk, the Board’s oversight is\nconducted principally through the committees of the Board. The Board satisfies its responsibility by requiring\neach committee chair to regularly report the committee’s considerations and actions, including risk oversight,\nas well as by requiring officers responsible for oversight of particular risks to submit regular reports. As these\nreports are submitted independent of review by Mr. Hsing, the Board believes that its leadership structure has\nno impact on the conduct of its risk oversight function other than to reinforce the involvement of the Board in\nongoing management of MPS.\n14\nThe following table outlines the specific risk oversight responsibilities of each committee:\nCommittee Primary Areas of Risk Oversight\nAudit • Oversee accounting policies and internal controls and evaluate\nenterprise risks associated with financial reporting, accounting, auditing\nand tax matters.\n• Assess financial risks relating to our cash management and\ninvestment programs.\nCompensation • Assess risks related to our compensation programs and practices.\n• Oversee risks related to human capital management.\nNCG • Assess risks and compliance related to corporate governance matters,\nincluding our policies and principles, our Board structure, membership\nand independence, and stockholder rights.\n• Evaluate exposures and risks related to cybersecurity, data privacy and\ninformation technology security and controls.\n• Assess risks arising from other ESG initiatives, including\nclimate-related risks.\nOur senior management team, which conducts our day-to-day risk management, is responsible for assisting\nthe Board and the committees with its risk oversight function. At its regularly scheduled meetings, the Board\nand the committees require officers responsible for oversight of particular risks to submit updates and reports on\nbusiness matters including operational and ESG issues, financial results, cybersecurity and information security,\nand business outlook and strategy. These updates enable our Board and the committees to discuss enterprise\nrisks with our senior management on a regular basis, including as a part of its annual strategic planning process\nand annual budget review.\nIn addition to requiring regular reporting from committees and officers, the Board also receives reports\nfrom third-party advisors in order to maintain oversight of risks that could affect us, including our independent\nauditors, outside counsel, compensation consultants and others. These advisors are consulted on a periodic\nbasis, and as particular issues arise, in order to provide the Board and the committees with the benefit of\nindependent expert advice and insights on specific risk-related matters.\nWe believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above is an effective approach for\naddressing the risks facing us and that the Board leadership structure supports this approach.\nNomination Process\nThe Board has adopted guidelines for the identification, evaluation and nomination of candidates for\ndirector. If the NCG Committee wishes to identify new independent director candidates for Board membership,\nit is authorized to retain and approve fees of third-party search firms to help identify prospective director\nnominees. It is the practice of the Board that our Lead Independent Director interviews each Board candidate.\nIn addition to the minimum qualifications the NCG Committee has established for director nominees,\nthe NCG Committee also considers whether a prospective nominee will foster a diversity of genders,\nraces, backgrounds, skills, perspectives and experiences in the process of its evaluation of each prospective\nnominee. As part of our commitment to diversity and inclusion, the NCG Committee charter requires that\nwomen and minority candidates be included in the initial pool from which the NCG Committee selects\nprospective candidates.\nThe NCG Committee also focuses on skills, expertise or background that would complement the existing\nBoard, recognizing that our businesses and operations are diverse and global in nature. While there are no\nspecific minimum qualifications for director nominees, the ideal candidate should (a) exhibit independence,\nintegrity, and qualifications that will increase overall Board effectiveness, and (b) meet other requirements as\nmay be required by applicable rules, such as financial literacy or expertise for audit committee members.\n15\nThe policy of the NCG Committee is to consider properly submitted stockholder nominations for\ncandidates to serve on the Board. Stockholders who wish to nominate a candidate for election to the Board,\nincluding nominations using proxy access, must comply with the procedures set forth in our Bylaws. Refer to\n“Procedure for Submitting Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations” for further details.\nThe NCG Committee uses the same process for evaluating all nominees, regardless of the original source\nof the nomination. After completing its review and evaluation of director candidates, the NCG Committee\nrecommends to the Board the director nominees for selection.\nStockholder Communications\nThe Board has approved a Stockholder Communication Policy to provide a process by which stockholders\nmay communicate directly with the Board or one or more of its members. You may contact any of our directors\nby writing to them using the following methods:\nBy e-mail: corporate.secretary@monolithicpower.com\nBy mail: Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\nAttn: Corporate Secretary\n5808 Lake Washington Blvd. NE\nKirkland, WA 98033\nAny stockholder communications to the Board will first go to the Corporate Secretary, who will log\nthe date of receipt of the communication as well as the identity of the correspondent in our stockholder\ncommunications log. The Corporate Secretary will review, summarize and, if appropriate, draft a response to\nthe communication in a timely manner. The Corporate Secretary will then forward copies of the stockholder\ncommunication to the Board member(s) (or specific Board member(s) if the communication is so addressed) for\nreview, provided that such correspondence concerns the functions of the Board or its committees, or otherwise\nrequires the attention of the Board or its members.\nAttendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders by the Board of Directors\nWe do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at our annual meetings of\nstockholders. In 2023, three Board members attended the Annual Meeting.\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct\nWe have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which is applicable to our directors and\nemployees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer,\ncontroller or persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available in\nthe “Investor Relations” section of our website at http://www.monolithicpower.com. We will disclose on our\nwebsite any amendment to the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as well as any waivers of the Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct, that are required to be disclosed by the rules of the SEC or NASDAQ.\nPolicy on Hedging and Other Transactions\nWe have adopted a policy that prohibits our directors, officers (including our named executive officers),\nand other employees from engaging in hedging or monetization transactions with respect to our stock that they\nobtained through our plans or otherwise, without prior approval by our Chief Compliance Officer. We also\nprohibit our directors and officers (including our named executive officers) from engaging in any short sales of\nour stock. In addition, our directors and officers are prohibited at all times from holding our stock in a margin\naccount and from pledging our stock as collateral.\n16\nDirector Voting Policy\nThe Board has adopted a director voting policy, which can be found in the “Investor Relations – Corporate\nGovernance” section of our website at http://www.monolithicpower.com. The policy establishes that any\ndirector nominee who receives more “Withheld” votes than “For” votes in an uncontested election held in an\nannual meeting of stockholders shall promptly tender his or her resignation. The disinterested directors of the\nBoard will then evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances and make a decision, within 90 days after the\nelection, on whether to accept the tendered resignation. The Board will promptly publicly disclose its decision\nand, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation.\nDirector Time Commitment Policy\nIn April 2024, the Board adopted a director time commitment policy, which can be found in the “Investor\nRelations – Corporate Governance” section of our website at http://www.monolithicpower.com. Directors are\nexpected to devote the time and attention necessary to fully discharge their responsibilities as members of the\nBoard and on each committee on which they serve. The policy also sets the following guidelines on public\ncompany board seats our directors can serve on:\n• No director may serve on more than five public company boards (including the Board);\n• No director who is an executive officer of a public company may serve on more than two public\ncompany boards (including the Board); and\n• No director who is a chair of a public company board may serve on more than three public company\nboards (including the Board).\nThe policy is subject to a waiver of such restrictions by a majority of non-affected members of the Board.\n2023 Director Compensation\nAnalysis of 2023 Compensation Elements\nFor 2023, the Board engaged Radford, an independent compensation consultant, to review our non-\nemployee director compensation. In its analysis, Radford gathered market data relating to the amount and type\nof compensation paid by our industry peer group for 2023 (see “Named Executive Officer Compensation —\nPeer Group and Use of Peer Data” for more information on the selection of the peer group). Based on its\nreview of the results of this market review and recommendations by Radford, the Board approved the following\ncompensation program for our non-employee directors for service in 2023:\nFee Description FY 2023 ($) FY 2022 ($) Change\nAnnual Board retainer fee ................................. 75,000 75,000 0%\nLead Independent Director fee ............................. 40,000 40,000 0%\nCompensation Committee chairperson fee .................... 20,000 20,000 0%\nCompensation Committee membership fee\n(excluding chairperson) ................................ 10,000 10,000 0%\nNCG Committee chairperson fee ........................... 15,000 15,000 0%\nNCG Committee membership fee (excluding chairperson) ....... 7,500 7,500 0%\nAudit Committee chairperson fee ........................... 30,000 30,000 0%\nAudit Committee membership fee (excluding chairperson) ....... 15,000 15,000 0%\nRestricted stock unit (“RSU”) grant to new directors ............ 220,000 220,000 0%\nAnnual RSU grant to incumbent directors .................... 220,000 220,000 0%\nThe initial grant of RSUs to new directors vests as to 50% of the underlying shares of Common Stock on\neach of the first and second anniversaries of the date of grant. The annual grant of RSUs to incumbent directors\nvests as to 100% of the underlying shares of Common Stock on the first anniversary of the date of the grant. All\nawards will become fully vested in the event of a change in control.\n17\nAll of our non-employee directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines that are described\nbelow in “Named Executive Officer Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Stock\nOwnership Guidelines.”\nThe following table sets forth the total compensation for each non-employee director for services rendered\nin 2023. Mr. Hsing, who is our employee, does not receive additional compensation for his services as a\ndirector.

We believe that positive ESG business practices strengthen our company and foster\nstrong relationships with our stockholders, employees, business partners and communities where we operate.\nWe are committed to making our workforce diverse, our business sustainable and our stakeholders engaged by\nmaintaining strong ESG practices and policies.\nESG Oversight\nWe believe that effective oversight is essential to ensure our ESG practices and policies are aligned with\nour business strategy and serve the long-term interests of our stockholders and other stakeholders. Our Board\nis actively engaged on ESG matters and has the ultimate responsibility on the oversight, management and\nimplementation of our ESG program. In its oversight role, our Board primarily focuses on:\n• Assessing ESG risks and opportunities and the impact of our strategy on our business and operations.\n• Setting measurable and rigorous goals, monitoring progress and reviewing status reports.\n• Establishing management accountability for ESG performance.\n• Reviewing our reporting processes and controls.\n• Overseeing our engagement and communications strategy with our stockholders and other stakeholders.\nOur Board has assigned oversight responsibilities of our ESG compliance efforts to its committees, and\nreceives reports and updates from each committee on a quarterly basis:\nNCG Committee Provides oversight of overall strategy, performance and risk assessments\nrelated to our ESG program, including environmental and social initiatives,\ncybersecurity and corporate governance matters.\nCompensation Committee Establishes executive accountability through compensation policies and\nprograms, and oversees human capital management.\nAudit Committee Oversees reporting, internal controls and disclosure requirements pursuant to\nregulatory standards.\nOur ESG Steering Committee is responsible for the day-to-day management of our ESG program\nand consists of a cross-functional group that includes two senior executives and leaders from Legal and\nCompliance, Information Technology, Facilities, Operations, Procurement, Quality Assurance, Product Line,\nHuman Resources, Finance, Supply Chain Management, and Environmental, Health and Safety. Under the\nsupervision of the Board committees, the ESG Steering Committee’s primary role is to: (a) manage the\nexecution of our corporate strategy relating to ESG, (b) develop and implement initiatives and policies, (c) drive\nESG performance, (d) oversee communications with employees, customers, suppliers, regulators and other\nstakeholders, and (e) monitor and assess regulatory developments and trends relating to ESG. On a quarterly\nbasis, each Board committee receives updates from the ESG Steering Committee. These updates provide the\nBoard committees with the opportunities to evaluate our ESG priorities, performance against our goals, and\nregulatory requirements.\nESG Initiative Highlights\nFor a complete description of our ESG priorities, initiatives and reduction goals, please refer to our\nCorporate Responsibility Report, which is available on our website at https://www.monolithicpower.com/en/\nabout-mps/investor-relations/esg-report.html. The information contained in our Corporate Responsibility Report\nand on our website is not intended to be part of this Proxy Statement and is not incorporated by reference into\nthis Proxy Statement.\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nPursuant to our Environmental and Climate Change Policy, we seek to responsibly protect the environment\nand conserve natural resources by implementing sustainability programs and solutions, engaging partners across\n19\nour value chain, and setting ambitious goals that we believe will help minimize the environmental impacts from\nour products and operations.\n• Carbon Footprint\nIn May 2023, the Board set a long-term goal to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”)\nemissions by 40% by 2030, against the 2022 baseline of 29,402 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Our\nScope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions inventory, which is determined using the operational control approach\nunder the GHG Protocol, covers all global operations and has been verified by an independent GHG data\nassurance firm. We plan to achieve the 40% reduction target by implementing the following initiatives, among\nothers: (a) powering our operations with renewable electricity, (b) adopting measures to reduce refrigerant\nemissions in our facilities, primarily in air conditioning and heating systems, and (c) completing other energy-\nefficient projects. In 2023, we reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 8% compared to the\n2022 baseline.\nIn addition, we are developing our value chain outreach plan to assess our Scope 3 emissions baseline and\nimplement reduction goals.\n• Renewable Energy\nOur goal is to increase renewable energy sources as part of our GHG emissions reduction strategy. We will\ncontinue to procure reliable energy supplies, including renewable resources where available, that are cost-\neffective and align with our business needs and environmental objectives. In May 2023, the Board set a long-\nterm goal to power our global operations with a minimum 75% renewable electricity by 2026. At the end of\n2023, our global operations were powered by 20% renewable electricity.\n• Waste\nWe continue to look for opportunities to minimize waste generation, most of which is produced at\nour testing facilities. In 2023, 81% of our waste from global operations was recycled or composted. Hazardous\nwaste represents a small fraction of our overall waste, and we are focused on managing our hazardous waste by\nworking closely with our vendors to identify and implement additional recycling programs.\n• Product Design\nOur products play a critical role in powering data center infrastructure. In our product design, we focus\non features that deliver new capabilities while improving performance and energy efficiency. As a result\nof increasingly intensive computing applications such as artificial intelligence, customers are looking for\nsustainable solutions that maximize power density in data centers. Using our proprietary power conversion\ntechnology, we are developing power modules with higher power density per rack that will decrease the\nphysical footprint on the motherboards. This power density improvement will enable more computing power in\nless space, which will result in energy savings in data centers.\n• Sustainable Operations\nAs part of our goal to achieve sustainable, energy-efficient operations, we have implemented various green\ntechnologies in our facilities, including solar panels and electric vehicle (“EV”) charging stations. Globally,\nwe have installed 33,500 square feet of solar panels, which generated close to 637 MWh of electricity, with\n158 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent savings in 2023. We have also installed 86 EV charging stations in\nvarious locations, available free of charge to employees.\n• Environmental Management System\nWe utilize an Environmental Management System (“EMS”) to achieve our environmental goals by\nestablishing objectives, processes and procedures to minimize negative environmental effects, enhance resource\nefficiency, comply with regulatory requirements, and promote sustainable practices throughout our value chain.\nOur EMS is compliant with the ISO 14001 standard.\n20\nSocial\nThrough our social initiatives, we aim to give back to our local communities and maintain a workplace that\nvalues diverse backgrounds, a healthy and safe environment, innovative thinking and professional growth. In\naddition, we conduct our business in a manner that respects the rights and dignity of all people, and we expect\nour business partners to uphold these principles as well.\n• Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nUnder our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy, our mission is to create an inclusive workplace\nthat supports all employees. We provide unconscious bias trainings for managers and human resources\nemployees administered by independent third parties to ensure that we promote an environment of inclusivity.\nIn our most recent pulse surveys, 90% of our employees said they were valued and treated with respect.\nWe file our EEO-1 report each year and publish the data publicly. In 2023, women made up approximately\n41% of our worldwide workforce. In the U.S., employees belonging to minority groups accounted for 69%\nof our workforce. We continue to recruit new talent through various university recruitment programs and\nemployment websites focusing on underrepresented minority groups.\nAs part of our commitment to diversity and inclusion, our NCG Committee charter requires women and\nminorities to be included in the initial pool of candidates when selecting new director nominees.\n• Training and Development\nWe encourage our employees to learn, innovate and grow their careers by providing them with access to\nvarious learning tools and resources to develop their business skills and knowledge. As part of our efforts to\ninvest in employee growth and development, we launched an online learning management system, Cornerstone,\nin 2023 that offers a comprehensive library of training courses on topics including business and leadership,\ncareer and technical skill development, ethical standards, health and safety, cybersecurity, diversity and\ninclusion, human rights and compliance.\n• Human Rights\nUnder our Code of Social Responsibility, we adhere to the standards established in the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights and strictly prohibit human trafficking and the use of forced, slave or child\nlabor in any form. We expect our employees and business partners to abide by these principles. Under our\nSupplier Code of Conduct, which aligns with Responsible Business Alliance’s Code of Conduct, we require\nour suppliers to maintain sound business ethics and labor practices that are in compliance with applicable laws\nand regulations. Failure by any of our suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct may result in\ntermination of our business relationship with such supplier.\n• Our Communities\nWe believe in being an active corporate citizen and making a positive impact on communities where we do\nbusiness. Through the MPS Foundation, we are committed to supporting non-profit organizations that focus on\nacademic research, environmental stewardship, performing arts, healthcare, food banks, youth programs, and\neducational and career opportunities for underrepresented groups with monetary contributions or investments.\nIn 2023, we contributed $10.9 million to the MPS Foundation, which has donated to organizations including\nUniversity of Washington, University of Florida, Forterra, Healthier Kids Foundation, Seattle Symphony, and\nVirginia Mason Foundation.\nGovernance\nOur overall governance framework is designed to promote strong oversight, create Board and management\naccountability, protect the rights of stockholders, and demonstrate our commitment to transparency,\nindependence and diversity. We believe that strong corporate governance is important for our long-term success\nand ensures that we manage ESG risks effectively while achieving our sustainability and social priorities.\n21\n• Board Diversity and Refreshment\nOur Board consists of members with a wide variety of skills, industry experiences and backgrounds. We\nbelieve a diverse, balanced and cohesive Board is critical in facilitating strong oversight, fostering diverse\nand new perspectives, as well as supporting the achievement of MPS’s long-term objectives. In 2023, after\nconducting a rigorous search, the Board appointed an additional female Board member, Ms. Eileen Wynne, who\nbrings to the Board a diverse background with more than 20 years of finance, accounting, operational and risk\nmanagement experience in the semiconductor industry.\nCurrently, five of our eight directors are ethnically diverse, and two directors are female. In addition, 25%\nof our directors were first appointed within the past three years.\nStockholder Engagement\nDuring 2023, we continued our practice of proactive stockholder engagement regarding important\nmatters including executive compensation, ESG and governance topics. Our management team, including\nour Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, and our Compensation Committee\nChair extended invitations to our largest institutional stockholders and had the opportunity to engage with\nstockholders representing approximately 50% of our total shares outstanding as of the Record Date. Subsequent\nto these meetings, our management team, the Board and its committees thoughtfully evaluated information\ngathered from our engagement process, together with feedback and input from our independent compensation\nconsultant, when making decisions for the next 12 months.\nThe following table summarizes the changes we have implemented, based on the key issues raised by\nour stockholders:\nWhat We Heard from Stockholders How We Responded\nESG • We should establish clear commitments • We made significant progress related to\nto addressing climate risks and setting our ESG program in 2023. We completed\nrigorous sustainability goals, and greater our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions\nlink between executive compensation and inventory and set goals to reduce our\nachievement of ESG goals. GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 and\npower our operations with at least 75%\nrenewable electricity by 2026.\n• In February 2024, the Compensation\nCommittee established accountability by\nlinking a portion of the executive equity\ncompensation to the achievement of the\nfollowing environmental goals by 2026:\n(1) Reduce GHG emissions by 25%;\n(2) Generate more than one-third of\nour automotive revenue from EV\nautomakers; and\n(3) Grow revenue from products\nenabling EV powertrains and 48V\nsystems to 200% compared to 2023.\nInvestors would like to implement these\nadditional ESG goals without changes to\nthe revenue-based goal.\n22\nWhat We Heard from Stockholders How We Responded\nCorporate • The Board should continue to establish • In 2023, the Board established an\nGovernance policies and practices that will help advisory board to assist us in various\npromote the Board’s dynamics and areas of our business and to recommend\neffectiveness, evaluate its performance potential candidates to join the Board\nand identify areas of improvement. over time.\n• In February 2024, the Board conducted\nan annual self-assessment of the\nperformance of each individual director,\nand the performance of the Board and\neach committee.\n• In April 2024, the Board adopted a policy\nregarding director time commitment to\nensure that directors devote the time and\nattention necessary to fully discharge\ntheir responsibilities as members of the\nBoard and on each committee on which\nthey serve.\nExecutive • For equity awards, performance periods • In February 2023, the Compensation\nCompensation of less than three years may fail to Committee extended the performance\nsufficiently incentivize long-term thinking period of the equity awards granted to our\namong executives. executives from two years to three years.\n• Our peer group should consist of similar • The Compensation Committee evaluated\ncompanies by market capitalization. the peer group composition criteria\nand removed certain semiconductor\ncompanies with a market capitalization\ngreater than $100 billion from the peer\ngroup for 2024.\n• Investors disfavor mid-cycle adjustments • The Compensation Committee\nto performance metrics. recognized that the changes in 2023 were\na one-time event in order to make the\nperformance conditions more rigorous\ndue to macroeconomic conditions. In\ngeneral, the Compensation Committee\ndoes not make mid-cycle changes but for\nextraordinary circumstances.\n• The target opportunity for the short-term • With inputs from our independent\nincentive program is relatively high compensation consultant, the\ncompared to peers. Compensation Committee conducted a\ncomprehensive review of the executive\ncompensation program during our\nannual review cycle in February 2024\nand lowered the target opportunity from\n200% to 150% for the 2024 short-term\ncash incentive plan.\n23\nPROPOSAL TWO\nRATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC\nACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has appointed EY as our independent registered public accounting firm\nfor the year ending December 31, 2024. EY has served as our independent registered public accounting firm\nsince March 2019. Representatives of EY are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity\nto make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate\nquestions. Although ratification by stockholders is not required by law, the Board has determined that it is\ndesirable to request ratification by the stockholders of this selection. Notwithstanding its selection, the Audit\nCommittee, in its discretion, may appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time\nduring the year if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interest of us and our\nstockholders. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of EY, the Audit Committee may reconsider its\nselection.\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS\nVOTE “FOR” RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF EY AS OUR INDEPENDENT\nREGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2024.\nAudit and Other Fees\nThe following table summarizes the fees for services provided by EY for 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nFY 2023 ($) FY 2022 ($)\nAudit fees ..................................................... $ 2,239 $ 1,825\nAudit-related fees ............................................... 34 —\nTax fees ....................................................... 6 6\nTotal ......................................................... $ 2,279 $ 1,831\nAudit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial\nstatements and review of the interim financial statements included in our quarterly reports and the audit of our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nAudit fees also include services in connection with foreign statutory and regulatory filings, and audit and\naccounting matters that arise during, or as a result of, the audit or the review of interim financial statements,\nincluding the application of proposed accounting rules, statutory audits required by non-U.S. jurisdictions and\nthe preparation of an annual “management letter” containing observations and discussions on internal control\nmatters.\nAudit-related fees represent assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance\nof the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.” These\nservices include accounting consultations in connection with attestation services that are not required by statute\nor regulation, and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.\nTax fees represent professional services for federal, state and international tax compliance, tax advice and\ntax planning.\nPre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services\nThe charter of our Audit Committee requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and\npermissible non-audit services provided to us by our independent registered public accounting firm. All such\nservices for 2023 and 2022 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.\n24\nPROPOSAL THREE\nADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION\nAs required under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to again cast an advisory\n(non-binding) vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\nRESOLVED, that, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as\ndisclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and related narratives and\ndescriptions of this Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting, is hereby APPROVED.\nThis advisory vote, commonly known as a “say-on-pay” vote, gives our stockholders the opportunity to\nexpress their views about the compensation we paid to our named executive officers, as described in this Proxy\nStatement. Before stockholders vote on this proposal, they should review the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis in this Proxy Statement and the tabular and narrative disclosure that follows it. We currently conduct\nsay-on-pay votes every year. Therefore, the next say-on-pay vote is expected to occur at the 2025 annual\nmeeting of stockholders.\nWe are committed to responsible compensation practices and structures. As described more fully in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, the primary goal of our executive\ncompensation program is the same as our goal for operating MPS — to create long-term value for our\nstockholders. To achieve this goal, we have regularly sought out the feedback of our major stockholders over the\npast several years to hear their suggestions on how we can better achieve our primary compensation goal. After\ntaking their feedback into consideration, we have continued to update our compensation program for our named\nexecutive officers, implementing those recommendations of our stockholders that the Compensation Committee\nbelieves will help us create long-term value for our stockholders. We believe these annual reviews of our\nprograms, in coordination with our conversations with our stockholders, allow us to motivate and reward our\nexecutives for sustained financial and operating performance and leadership excellence, to align their interests\nwith those of our stockholders, and to encourage them to remain with us for long and productive careers.\nStockholders may vote “for” or “against” the resolution or abstain from voting on the resolution.

In accordance with our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, it is\nthe responsibility of our employees and directors to disclose any significant financial interest in a transaction\nbetween us and a third party, including an indirect interest, through, for example, a relative or significant other.\nIt is also the responsibility of our Audit Committee, as described in the Audit Committee Charter, to review on\nan ongoing basis all related party transactions and approve these transactions before they are entered into.\nIn 2020, we made a CHF 3,000,000 equity investment (or $3,300,000 on the acquisition date) in a privately\nheld Swiss company (the “Investee”) specializing in mobile robotics for industrial applications. The investment\nrepresented a 5% equity interest in the Investee on a fully diluted basis. In 2022, we made a CHF 2,000,000\ninvestment (or $2,100,000 on the acquisition date) in a convertible loan that would convert into additional\nshares of the Investee. Mr. Elmiger is an executive officer of a company that has a commercial relationship\nwith the Investee, and Mr. Hsing had personally invested CHF 2,700,000 in the Investee. In addition, Mr. Hsing\nserved on the Investee’s board of directors. In 2023, we sold all our investments in the Investee for $7.4 million\n27\nand recorded a gain of $1.4 million. Subsequent to the sale, we no longer have any business or financial\nrelationships with the Investee.\nNAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our compensation philosophy and programs,\ncompensation decisions made under those programs, and factors considered in making these decisions for our\n“named executive officers” (“NEOs”) who, for 2023, were:\n• Michael Hsing, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer;\n• Bernie Blegen, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer;\n• Deming Xiao, Executive Vice President, Global Operations;\n• Maurice Sciammas, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Marketing; and\n• Saria Tseng, Executive Vice President, Strategic Corporate Development, General Counsel and\nCorporate Secretary.\nFor further information regarding each NEO’s professional background, please refer to “Information About\nExecutive Officers” under Item 1 of our 2023 Annual Report.\nExecutive Summary\nFinancial and Business Performance Highlights:\nThe Compensation Committee has focused our executives on accountability in revenue, operating income\nand earnings, as well as maximizing stockholder return through the structure of our executive compensation\nprogram. In 2023, despite the continued global economic uncertainty, MPS achieved record revenue of $1.8\nbillion. This was our 12th consecutive year of revenue growth.\nOur revenue grew 1.5% from the prior year, compared with the analog industry’s 9% decrease reported by\nthe Semiconductor Industry Association (“SIA”). Our financial results are summarized as follows (in millions,\nexcept per-share amounts and percentages):\nGAAP Non-GAAP(1)\nFY 2023 ($) FY 2022 ($) Change FY 2023 ($) FY 2022 ($) Change\nRevenue ........................... 1,821.1 1,794.1 1.5% 1,821.1 1,794.1 1.5%\nOperating income ................... 481.7 526.8 (8.6)% 641.1 680.9 (5.8)%\nNet income ........................ 427.4 437.7 (2.4)% 574.6 599.9 (4.2)%\nDiluted EPS ........................ 8.76 9.05 (3.2)% 11.78 12.41 (5.1)%\n(1) The reconciliation of the GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures and related\ndisclosures are provided in Annexure A.\nIn 2023, we continued to execute our long-term strategy by bringing innovative new products to market,\nexpanding design wins across our broad base of customers and diversifying our operations, some of which are\nhighlighted below:\n• Our integrated power management solutions for artificial intelligence enabled our customers to unlock\npreviously untapped opportunities for innovation and growth.\n• We created new automotive content, powering the ramp of autonomous driving, the digital cockpit and\nlighting systems for both conventional and electric vehicles.\n28\n• We continued to diversify our global research and development footprint with further expansion of our\nengineering centers in Europe and Taiwan.\n• We continued to diversify our global manufacturing footprint with the qualification of multiple new fabs\nand packaging partners in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.\nCash Dividends and Stock Repurchases:\nDue to our continued strong performance, we have increased the amount of our dividends paid to\nstockholders over the last few years. The following table summarizes our cash dividend payments to our\nstockholders in the past three years (in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nFY 2023 ($) FY 2022 ($) FY 2021 ($)\nDividend per share .......................................... 4.00 3.00 2.40\nTotal cash dividend payments .................................. 190,642 140,337 110,206\nIn February 2024, the Board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividends to $1.25 per share.\nIn October 2023, the Board approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to\n$640 million in the aggregate of our Common Stock through October 2026. We repurchased approximately\n7,000 shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $3.7 million in 2023.\nTotal Stockholder Return (“TSR”):\nOur one-year and three-year TSR outperformed our peer group, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (the\n“PHLX Index”) and the S&P 500 Index:\n(1) Represents our 2023 peer group approved by the Compensation Committee. See “Peer Group and Use of\nPeer Data” for further discussion.\nMarket Capitalization:\nOur strong financial performance in the past several years has translated to a significant increase in our\nmarket capitalization, surpassing $30 billion for the first time in 2023. The following chart illustrates Mr.\nHsing’s compensation (as reported in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table) compared to our market\ncapitalization in the past three years:\n29\nCompensation Philosophy:\nThe primary objective in designing our compensation program for our NEOs is the same as the primary\nobjective for operating MPS — to create long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve this goal, we have\ndesigned and implemented our compensation programs for our NEOs to:\n• Motivate and reward them for sustained financial and operating performance and leadership excellence;\n• Align their interests with those of our stockholders;\n• Encourage our NEOs to focus on achieving both short-term goals as well as long-term goals; and\n• Encourage our NEOs to remain with us for long and productive careers.\nEach one of our executive compensation elements fulfills one or more of our performance, alignment and\nretention objectives. These elements primarily consist of salary, long-term equity awards and short-term cash\nincentive compensation, as well as severance benefits and broad-based employee benefits. In deciding on the\ntype and amount of compensation for each executive, we focus on both current pay and the opportunity for\nfuture compensation. We believe that maintaining a balance of short-term and long-term compensation elements\nencourages decision-making that optimizes short-term results and, at the same time, advances our long-term\ngoals. We combine the compensation elements for each NEO in a manner we believe optimizes the executive’s\noverall contribution to us and our stockholders.\nOur Compensation Practices Are Built on Stockholder Feedback and Requests:\nAt the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we received approximately 57% advisory approval of our\nNEOs’ compensation. At the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we received approximately 72% advisory\napproval of our NEOs’ compensation. At the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we received approximately\n88% advisory approval of our NEOs’ compensation. While these say-on-pay votes are only advisory and\nnot binding on us, the Compensation Committee discusses the vote results each year with our independent\ncompensation consultant and the Board.\nOur management team continued the practice of reaching out to our most significant stockholders from\ntime to time to discuss how those stockholders view our executive compensation program, and what kind of\nchanges they would like to see implemented in future years. Many of our stockholders were pleased with our\n30\nstrong financial performance and execution, as well as the progress we have made on our ESG program which\ndemonstrates our commitment to environmental issues. Based on the most recent feedback we have received\nfrom our stockholders, the Compensation Committee made the following significant changes to the executive\ncompensation program:\n• Performance Period. We extended the performance period of the 2023 equity compensation program\nfrom two years to three years.\n• Peer Group. We removed certain semiconductor companies with a market capitalization greater than\n$100 billion from our peer group starting in 2024.\n• Mid-Cycle Changes to Performance Metrics. The Compensation Committee recognized that the changes\nin 2023 were a one-time event in order to make the performance conditions more rigorous due to\nmacroeconomic conditions. In general, the Compensation Committee does not make mid-cycle changes\nbut for extraordinary circumstances.\n• Decrease in Target Opportunity. The Compensation Committee conducted a comprehensive analysis of\nthe executive compensation program during our annual review cycle in February 2024 and lowered the\ntarget opportunity from 200% to 150% for the 2024 short-term cash incentive plan.\nSee “Stockholder Engagement” for further discussion.\nIn the past several years, we have continued to improve our executive compensation policies and programs,\nincorporating the suggestions of our stockholders. We believe these improvements, as highlighted below, have\nsupported our financial and strategic successes in the last several years.\n1. A significant portion of our NEOs’ payout opportunity is at risk, which clearly demonstrates the direct\nlink between pay and performance.\nOur success is built on a strong pay-for-performance culture within our entire organization, including\namong our rank-and-file employees in addition to our CEO and other NEOs. The Compensation Committee\nbelieves that a performance-based compensation program based on a small guaranteed pay and a significant\nupside for our executives and employees provides strong incentives that will generate more robust returns\nto our stockholders than more traditional compensation packages.\nFor 2023, a small portion of the total compensation packages for the NEOs was a guaranteed component,\nconsisting of base salary that was among the lowest in the semiconductor industry. The remaining target\ncompensation, consisting of short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentive awards, is at risk and\ndirectly linked to performance, as outlined in the graphs below:\n31\nIn order to earn the maximum payout for the at-risk awards, the NEOs must exceed targeted performance.\nIn 2023, the total compensation for the NEOs were significantly lower (by as much as 33%) compared\nto the prior year primarily because the maximum non-GAAP operating income goals were not achieved\nunder the short-term incentive plan, which resulted in a payout that was well below the maximum payout\nopportunity. See “Analysis of 2023 Compensation Elements” for further discussion.\nWe believe this pay structure is a more responsible approach because it focuses on performance and\naccountability. In the years when the NEOs earned the maximum payout, we also achieved significant\nbusiness growth and outperformed the market and our peers. In the years when we did not meet the\nrigorous performance goals, the NEOs were not able to earn the maximum payout. This compensation\nphilosophy fully demonstrates a direct correlation between performance and pay.\n2. Commitment to short-term cash incentives and long-term equity awards using different performance\nmetrics, and alignment of executive compensation with the interests of our stockholders.\nOur stockholders expressed a preference for the use of different performance metrics across our plans. In\ndetermining performance metrics, our Compensation Committee selected those that have a greater\nconnection to financial and stock performance. Therefore, we use non-GAAP operating income for our\nshort-term cash incentive plan, and, to balance that metric, a mix of revenue and operating goals for our\nlong-term performance equity incentive plan. By using a non-GAAP operating income metric in our short-\nterm incentive plan and various performance metrics in our long-term incentive plan, we can reward our\nexecutives for achieving our short-term financial objectives while at the same time planning for long-term\ngrowth, without encouraging excessive risk taking.\nIn 2023, 100% of the annual cash incentives earned by the NEOs continued to be tied to specific,\npre-established non-GAAP operating income metrics, and 100% of the total equity awards (in the\nform of performance-based restricted stock units) granted to our NEOs were tied to the following\nperformance conditions: (a) achievement of an average revenue growth rate as measured against the\nanalog industry’s average revenue growth rate over a three-year performance period, and (b) securing\nadditional manufacturing capacity outside of China to support our long-term supply chain strategy over\na three-year performance period. No equity awards were granted to the NEOs that vest solely based on\ncontinued service.\nThe following graph shows the three-year history of our performance in revenue, GAAP operating income\nand non-GAAP operating income, which demonstrates a balance of our overall financial health, compared\nto our CEO’s total compensation (as reported in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table).\n32\n(1) The reconciliation of the GAAP operating income to the non-GAAP operating income and related\ndisclosures are provided in Annexure A.\nWe believe our cumulative TSR performance over the past ten years, as illustrated below, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our performance-based compensation program in motivating our NEOs to build a sustainable\nbusiness model and to focus on long-term value creation for our stockholders.\n33\n3. Capping payouts under our non-equity incentive plans.\nOur Compensation Committee has capped maximum cash payouts under our annual non-equity incentive\nplans at 400% of target for all of the NEOs.\n4. Clawback policy.\nIn October 2023, the Board adopted the Compensation Recoupment Policy to comply with Section 10D\nof the Exchange Act and the NASDAQ listing standards as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The policy\nprovides for the recovery, in the event of a required accounting restatement, of certain variable incentive-\nbased cash and equity compensation received by current or former executive officers (within the meaning\nof Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act, and including our NEOs) that is based on erroneously reported\nfinancial information during a three-year recovery period preceding a financial restatement, subject to\nlimited exceptions, to the extent that such payments exceed the amount of performance-based incentive\ncompensation that would have been received by such executive officers during such period had they\nbeen determined based on the relevant restated amounts. The recovery of incentive-based compensation\nis required regardless of whether the executive officer engaged in any misconduct or was at fault for the\nrestatement. A copy of the policy is filed as Exhibit 97.1 to our 2023 Annual Report.\n5. Stock ownership guidelines.\nWe have significant stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs and directors, requiring ownership levels by\nour officers of two to five times their base salary, and by our directors of three times their annual retainer.\n6. Tax gross-ups.\nSince 2008, we have not adopted any new employment agreements (or modified any existing employment\nagreements) to provide for tax gross-ups to our officers.\n34\n7. Responsible share ownership.\nWe have a policy prohibiting our directors, officers (including our NEOs), and other employees from\nengaging in certain hedging and monetization transactions with respect to our stock that they hold without\nprior approval by our Chief Compliance Officer. The policy also prohibits our directors and officers\n(including our NEOs) from engaging in any short sales of our stock. In addition, our directors and officers\nare prohibited at all times from holding our stock in a margin account and from pledging our stock\nas collateral.\nWe routinely engage with our stockholders to exchange ideas on our existing executive compensation\nprograms and potential future programs. We listen to their feedback and carefully consider it. Our engagement\nwith stockholders does not begin and end with the say-on-pay vote – that vote is just one part of a larger\ndialogue and partnership we have with our investors.\nThe Roles of the Compensation Committee and Our Officers in Setting Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has primary\nresponsibility for overseeing the design, development and implementation of the compensation program\nfor our CEO and other NEOs. The Compensation Committee Charter, which is available in the “Investor\nRelations” section of our website at http://www.monolithicpower.com, was originally adopted in 2007, and is\nupdated periodically. Pursuant to the Compensation Committee Charter, the Compensation Committee reviews\nand approves the compensation arrangements for our NEOs, including the CEO, and administers our equity\ncompensation plans. The Compensation Committee meets at least once a quarter. In 2023, the Compensation\nCommittee met four times.\nThe Compensation Committee reviews the performance of each officer taking into account the evaluations\nprovided by the CEO for all officers other than himself. The Compensation Committee makes the final\ndetermination of performance achievement for each officer. The CEO, Chief Financial Officer and General\nCounsel present information to the Compensation Committee as requested from time to time, including\nfinancial results, future budget information, business operations and legal developments. The Compensation\nCommittee regularly meets in closed sessions without the CEO or other management personnel present. Our\nofficers also provide information to the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant, if\nrequested to do so, to help the consultant perform its duties for the Compensation Committee. Our officers are\nresponsible for implementing the decisions made by the Compensation Committee.\nIndependent Compensation Consultant\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee again engaged Radford as the independent compensation consultant\nwith respect to our non-employee director and executive compensation programs. Radford did not perform any\nother work for us. In 2023, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Radford pursuant to\nSEC rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent them from serving as independent\nconsultant to the Compensation Committee.\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee requested and received the following services from Radford:\n(1) updates on evolving compensation trends, (2) recommendations for additions or deletions to the peer group\nused for 2023, (3) compensation data for officers and directors (gathered from public filings for our peers\nand broader surveys), and (4) general advice on analyzing and responding to stockholder feedback on our\ncompensation programs.\nPeer Group and Use of Peer Data\nIn February 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed recommendations made by our independent\ncompensation consultant and selected a peer group of companies in the semiconductor and similar industries\nwith revenue approximately ranging from 50% to 300% of our revenue for the most recent four quarters. In\naddition, the Compensation Committee selected large cap semiconductor companies that have a similar growth\nprofile and are the key competitors for talent, and companies in the semiconductor and electronic component\nindustries based on the recommendation by Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc., a proxy advisory firm.\n35\nThe 2023 peer group consisted of the following companies, which did not change from 2022:\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Micron Technology, Inc. Silicon Laboratories, Inc.\nAmbarella, Inc. NVIDIA Corporation Skyworks Solutions, Inc.\nAnalog Devices, Inc. ON Semiconductor Corporation Synaptics Incorporated\nApplied Materials, Inc. Power Integrations, Inc. Teradyne, Inc.\nCirrus Logic, Inc. Qorvo, Inc. Texas Instruments Incorporated\nCoherent, Inc. Rambus Inc. Universal Display Corporation\nMKS Instruments, Inc. Semtech Corporation Wolfspeed, Inc.\nIn February 2024, based on the feedback received from our stockholders, the Compensation Committee\nremoved the following semiconductor companies with market capitalization greater than $100 billion from our\npeer group: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Applied Materials, Inc. and NVIDIA Corporation.\nNEO Compensation Components\nThe table below summarizes the core elements, objectives and key features of our 2023 compensation\nprogram for our NEOs:\nCompensation Components Objectives Key Features\nBase salary Designed to reward individual effort • Paid in cash.\nassociated with job-related duties and • Reviewed annually.\nto attract and retain talented executive\nofficers.\nShort-term cash Designed to encourage outstanding • Paid in cash.\nincentive compensation company performance by motivating • Reviewed annually.\nthe NEOs to achieve short-term\n• 100% of the compensation is subject\nfinancial goals.\nto financial performance goals.\n• Payouts capped at 400% of target.\n• Subject to clawback policy.\nLong-term equity Designed to align the interests of • Reviewed annually.\nincentive compensation our NEOs with the interests of our • 100% of the awards is subject to\nstockholders by focusing on our revenue and operational goals.\nlong-term financial and business\n• Maximum payouts at 500%\nperformance.\nof target.\n• Subject to clawback policy.\nDividend equivalents Designed to treat equity award holders • Paid in cash.\nequally with stockholders under our • Equal to the dividend declared and\ndividend program. paid on a share of Common Stock.\n• Accumulate during the vesting\nperiod of the underlying\nequity awards.\n• Subject to forfeiture if the\nunderlying equity awards do\nnot vest.\nAnalysis of 2023 Compensation Elements\nBase Salaries:\nWe provide base salary for our NEOs’ day-to-day duties, and seek to set base salaries at levels that will\nretain talented executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers peer data as one key factor in\nreviewing base salary each year. The Compensation Committee also considers each individual executive’s role\n36\nand the scope of his or her responsibilities, the executive’s experience, his or her tenure with us, and size of\nrecent salary changes. For 2023, the Compensation Committee considered all of these factors and approved the\nfollowing salaries for our NEOs:\nName FY 2023 ($) FY 2022 ($) Change\nMichael Hsing .......................................... 831,600 756,000 10%\nBernie Blegen .......................................... 404,300 367,500 10%\nDeming Xiao ........................................... 438,900 399,000 10%\nMaurice Sciammas ...................................... 438,900 399,000 10%\nSaria Tseng ............................................ 438,900 399,000 10%\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in base salaries for our NEOs to account for\ninflation adjustments and better align the amounts with the pay practices of our peer group.\nShort-Term Cash Incentive Compensation:\nWe provide a short-term cash incentive opportunity to each of our NEOs to encourage them to achieve\nour corporate short-term operating income goals. The Compensation Committee used non-GAAP operating\nincome as the sole corporate performance metric for determining the short-term cash incentive (or bonus)\ncompensation. The Compensation Committee believed that non-GAAP operating income would best reflect our\nshort-term performance. See Annexure A for a reconciliation of the GAAP operating income to the non-GAAP\noperating income used in the short-term cash incentive plan.\n100% of the short-term cash incentives were tied to a specific, pre-established non-GAAP operating income\nmetric for all the NEOs. The target bonus for each NEO was 200% of his or her annual base salary. For 2023,\nour non-GAAP operating income target was $660.3 million as established in the annual operating plan approved\nby the Board. Achievement of 120% or more of the non-GAAP operating income target would result in a\nmaximum 400% payout of the target bonus for each NEO, achievement of 100% of the non-GAAP operating\nincome target would result in a 100% target bonus payout, and performance below 80% of the non-GAAP\noperating income target would result in no bonus payout. For performance between the minimum, target and\nmaximum levels, the percentage of payout would be determined based on linear interpolation.\nFor 2023, we achieved non-GAAP operating income of $648.0 million (see Annexure A), which resulted\nin a payout of 90.7% of the target bonus for each NEO. The following table summarizes the 2023 bonus payout\napproved by the Compensation Committee for each of our NEOs:\nBonus Amount\nName Minimum ($) Target ($) Maximum ($) Earned ($)\nMichael Hsing ................................. — 1,663,200 6,652,800 1,508,805\nBernie Blegen ................................. — 808,600 3,234,400 733,537\nDeming Xiao .................................. — 877,800 3,511,200 796,314\nMaurice Sciammas ............................. — 877,800 3,511,200 796,314\nSaria Tseng ................................... — 877,800 3,511,200 796,314\nLong-Term Equity Incentive Compensation:\nWe provide long-term equity compensation awards to reward and retain our valued executives, and to\nencourage our executives to focus on achieving long-term development goals for the future.\nIn determining the number of shares subject to long-term equity compensation awards granted to each of\nthe NEOs, the Compensation Committee establishes a value of such awards, which represents a multiple of\neach NEO’s target cash compensation. The Compensation Committee believes these multiples properly reflect\nthe relative position and responsibility of each NEO as well as the officer’s ability to develop the vision for the\nfuture of MPS, drive the strategy to obtain such vision, and effect certain cost savings for us.\n37\nWe have regularly engaged with our stockholders for their opinions in setting performance metrics. The\nCompensation Committee believes that the NEOs’ long-term incentive compensation should be in the form of\nequity and 100% of the equity awards granted to our NEOs in 2023 should vest based on the achievement of\nperformance-based criteria. No equity awards were granted to our NEOs in 2023 that would vest solely based\non continued service.\nA Balanced Approach to Our Equity Compensation Program\nThe Compensation Committee is committed to establishing a balanced equity compensation program with\ndifferent performance objectives and a long-term performance period. When designing the annual executive\nequity compensation program, the Compensation Committee is guided by the following three key principles\nthat promote the best interests of both MPS and its stockholders:\n• There is appropriate pay-for-performance alignment.\n• The performance goals must be rigorous.\n• The program requires substantial stockholder value creation.\nIn February 2023, the Compensation Committee granted performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) to each\nNEO that are subject to the achievement of two performance conditions: (i) our revenue growth rate compared\nagainst the analog industry during a three-year (2023 to 2025) performance period and (ii) increase in our\nmanufacturing capacity outside of China to support our supply chain strategy over the same three-year period.\nThe following table summarizes the number of shares subject to the 2023 PSUs that can be earned by the NEOs\nat the minimum, target and maximum performance levels, subject to the criteria described below. The number of\nshares earned will be linearly interpolated for actual achievement between the minimum, target and maximum\nperformance levels.\nNumber of Shares Maximum Earn-Out Components\nManufacturing\nMinimum Target Maximum Revenue Goal Diversification Goal\nName (#) (#) (#) (#) (#)\nMichael Hsing ................... — 27,365 136,825 82,095 54,730\nBernie Blegen ................... — 7,749 38,745 23,247 15,498\nDeming Xiao .................... — 11,434 57,170 34,302 22,868\nMaurice Sciammas ............... — 11,434 57,170 34,302 22,868\nSaria Tseng ..................... — 11,434 57,170 34,302 22,868\nThe PSUs contained a purchase price feature, which required the NEOs to pay MPS $30 per share upon\nvesting of the shares. The target number of shares granted to each NEO was determined based on the target\ncompensation value for such PSUs, divided by our closing stock price on the date of grant less the purchase\nprice. This $30 purchase price requirement would be deemed satisfied and waived if the closing stock price on\nthe last trading day of the performance period is $30 higher than the closing stock price on the date of grant.\nFirst Performance Condition - Revenue Goal\nFor 2023, the number of PSUs that can ultimately be earned at the end of the three-year performance\nperiod on December 31, 2025, is based on MPS’s average three-year (2023 to 2025) revenue growth rate\nas measured against the average three-year revenue growth rate for the analog industry published by the\nSIA. Taking into account of the semiconductor industry’s cyclical nature and stockholders’ feedback, the\nCompensation Committee determined that three years is the most optimal performance period for the revenue-\nbased PSU awards. A revenue-based performance period that is longer than three years makes it impractical\nfor the Compensation Committee to determine appropriate performance goals due to the volatility from\nmacroeconomic and industry-specific conditions.\n38\nIn selecting the minimum, target and maximum performance levels, the Compensation Committee\ncarefully considered our historical and projected performance and the fundamentals of the analog industry\nat that time. The Compensation Committee took into account SIA’s projections for the anticipated revenue\ngrowth in the analog industry for the three-year performance period. Instead of benchmarking against the\nbroad semiconductor sector, the Compensation Committee elected to focus solely on the analog industry in\nsetting the performance objectives, which are measured against our closest and most relevant peers within the\nsemiconductor sector. In addition, the Compensation Committee chose the revenue projections reported by SIA\nas the baseline because the SIA report is well-respected in the semiconductor industry and used by Wall Street\nfinancial analysts in preparing their analyses, forecasts and recommendations.\nThe performance criteria and the minimum, target and maximum levels of the PSUs that can be earned\nwere as follows:\nMPS’s Average Three-Year Revenue\nGrowth Rate Exceeds the Analog Industry by PSU Earn-Out\nLess than 3% 0%\n3% 50% of Target\n5% 100% of Target\n15% and above 300% of Target\nSecond Performance Condition – Manufacturing Diversification Goal\nA significant portion of our wafer, assembly, testing and packaging capacity has historically come from\nfoundry partners and suppliers located in China. In recent years, we faced increasing supply chain risks of\nconducting business in China due to a number of external factors, including trade tensions between the U.S\nand China, geopolitical unrest, human right issues, and business disruptions as a result of natural disasters or\npandemics. Many of our key stakeholders have focused on our supply chain and wanted to understand how we\nplan to manage these business risks. For example, in our quarterly earnings webinars, several of our analysts\nasked us to provide updates:\nAnalyst A: “ Could you just give us an update on the manufacturing footprint-- both from a capacity\nperspective, but more importantly about diversification? You talked about you’re looking at\nall sorts of regions to partner with some new manufacturing partners. So both capacity, but\nthen also from a geographical perspective, perhaps, an update?” (May 2, 2022)\nAnalyst B: “ A majority of your wafer supply is still in China, plus you’ve got your big Chengdu\nbackend facility. How concerned are you with trying to de-risk supply chain as we keep\nwatching headlines with the U.S. government trying to tighten restrictions in China? And\nmaybe as part of that, if you could talk give a sense maybe of timing and capacity plans\nthere?” (August 1, 2022)\nAnalyst C: “ You are working to move the operations and the manufacturing footprint and other pieces\noutside of China to, in the long term, more sort of aligning with your TAM and revenue\nmix for the really, really long-term in the company. And you’ve been very clear about those\nplans. But there’s been some more reports of some customers that want to very quickly use\nproduct sources outside of China. Are you already sourcing outside of China to support\nmany of your global customers?” (October 27, 2022)\nOur priority is to diversify our global manufacturing footprint to other regions in Asia and build a resilient,\ncost-effective supply chain strategy that can adapt to dynamic and challenging market conditions with minimal\nbusiness disruptions, while maintaining competitive advantages. In support of this initiative, the Compensation\nCommittee approved a second performance metric in February 2023 that requires us to secure additional\nmanufacturing capacity outside of China over a three-year (2023 to 2025) performance period. In setting this\nperformance condition, the Compensation Committee believed that the goal should be rigorous and impactful,\nalign with our overall long-term business plan, and create positive values to our customers.\n39\nThe minimum, target and maximum levels of the PSUs that can be earned is determined based upon an\nincrease of our total manufacturing capacity outside of China that can support up to $1.2 billion of annual\nrevenue for North America and EMEA before December 31, 2025, as set forth below:\nPercentage of Capacity to Support $1.2 Billion of\nAnnual Revenue for North America and EMEA PSU Earn-Out\nLess than 70% 0% of Target\n70% 50% of Target\n80% 100% of Target\n100% or more 200% of Target\nThe performance period for both the first performance condition and the second performance condition\nis three years (2023 to 2025). If the performance metrics are achieved, the PSUs will vest on December 31,\n2025, subject to continued employment through such date. The NEOs will be required to pay MPS $30 per\nshare upon vesting of the shares, unless the stock price target as described above is achieved.\nDividend Equivalents\nIn connection with our quarterly cash dividend program, all outstanding and unvested time and\nperformance-based full value stock awards granted to employees, including the NEOs, have the right to receive\ndividend equivalents in order to maintain the economic alignment between the value of such awards and the\nvalue of a share of our Common Stock. The dividend equivalents are accumulated during the vesting periods\nof the shares underlying such awards and are paid in cash to employees only if and when the underlying shares\nvest. Dividend equivalents accrued on the underlying shares are forfeited if the employees do not fulfill their\nservice requirement during the vesting periods. Dividend equivalents paid to the NEOs in 2023 are included in\n“2023 Option Exercises and Stock Vested” below.\nCertifications of Achievement of Prior Performance-Based Awards\nAs previously disclosed in our proxy statement for the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the\nCompensation Committee granted each NEO a PSU award in February 2021 (the “2021 PSUs”) that could\nbe earned based on the achievement of three environmental goals during a three-year performance period.\nThe maximum earn-out was 100% of the target grant. The actual results, as approved by the Compensation\nCommittee in May 2023, were as follows:\nAchievement of Environmental Goals PSU Earned\nGoal #1 • Established Board oversight to ensure our ESG practices and policies are aligned 25% of\nwith our Environmental and Climate Change Policy, long-term business strategy, Target\nand external requirements and expectations.\n• Defined the scope of our environmental projects for our global operations in\naccordance with GHG Protocol, an internationally accepted carbon accounting\nstandard.\n• Developed measurable milestones designed to ensure that our goals could be\nachieved within the performance period set by the Compensation Committee,\nand within a budget that would not cause a significant burden to our financial\nresources and operations.\n• Engaged sustainability consultants to help us better understand the key\nenvironmental priorities for the semiconductor industry and other key\nstakeholders.\n• Conducted initial analyses and identified gaps in our GHG emissions, waste\nmanagement and product efficiency, which helped us prioritize areas of focus and\ndesign an effective project plan.\n• Invested in additional staff with substantial expertise, both academically and\nprofessionally, who understands relevant regulatory requirements and best\npractices, and can manage the complex technical issues.\n40\nAchievement of Environmental Goals PSU Earned\nGoal #2 • Formed an ESG Steering Committee consisting of a team of two senior executives 25% of\nin charge of compliance and operations, cross-functional managers and personnel Target\nto establish our missions and sustainability policies, and to supervise the\nmanagement and execution of our ESG initiatives.\n• Collected, analyzed and reconciled baseline data that was far more complex than\nwhat we had reviewed and compiled in previous years, including a thorough\nreview of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 data sources such as refrigerants, natural gas\nheating, generators, electricity and fuel covering global facilities, which include\ntesting facilities, design centers, EMC labs and offices.\n• Improved the quality of records and documentation using a third-party software\nplatform, so that we could accurately and timely report our data in accordance\nwith global frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\nand the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.\n• Completed an assessment of our waste handling procedures and evaluated the\nenergy efficiency of our solutions used in data centers.\n• Established the credibility of our emissions data by working with a third-party\nfirm specializing in auditing GHG emissions data, and received assurance on\nthe accuracy and completeness of our emissions data in accordance with GHG\nProtocol.\nGoal #3 • Developed GHG reduction target proposals that we believe are reasonable, 50% of\nrigorous and measurable by conducting an in-depth analysis of: (a) various Target\nreduction measures including investments in new equipment and procedures for\nrefrigerant reductions, renewable energy credits, green tariffs and solar panels, as\nwell as the economic benefits of implementing these measures in each country\nwhere we have significant operations, (b) our long-term business expansion plan,\nas well as refrigerant, fuel and electricity usage projections for our facilities, and\n(c) our long-term financial model designed to achieve the proposed reduction\ngoals.\n• Conducted peer benchmarking analyses and studied the scope of our peers’\nenvironmental initiatives, their assumptions and methodologies, targets and\ntimelines for reducing GHG emissions and adopting renewable energy, and their\nperformance against their goals, so we could align with best practices within the\nsemiconductor industry.\n• Evaluated the different GHG emissions reduction proposals with our management\nteam, assessed the overall rigor of the reduction goals and the reasonableness\nof key assumptions used in our financial model, conducted cost analyses of the\nproposals, and reviewed the financial, operational and regulatory risks associated\nwith the proposals.\n• Provided quarterly updates to the Board on our progress, who evaluated our\nperformance, challenged methodologies and assumptions used, and more\nimportantly, ensured that our ESG initiatives would align with our long-term\nbusiness strategy without undesired or excessive risks.\n• Established rigorous mid- and long-term goals on GHG emissions, renewable\nelectricity, waste management and power density improvements related to certain\nproducts used in data centers.\n• Published our first Corporate Responsibility Report, which highlights our\nenvironmental, social and governance initiatives, practices and goals.\n41\nThe following table summarizes the actual number of shares earned under the 2021 PSUs for the NEOs:\nName Number of Shares Earned (#)\nMichael Hsing ................................................ 37,613\nBernie Blegen ................................................ 7,619\nDeming Xiao ................................................. 11,580\nMaurice Sciammas ............................................ 11,580\nSaria Tseng .................................................. 11,580\nThe awards fully vested on May 2, 2023, and include a post-vesting sales restriction period of one year.\nBroad-Based Benefits\nOur NEOs are eligible to participate in our broad-based employee benefit programs on the same terms\noffered to our employees. These benefit programs include the employee stock purchase plan, medical,\ndental and vision insurance, long-term and short-term disability insurance, life and accidental death and\ndismemberment insurance, and health and dependent care flexible spending accounts. We do not provide\npension arrangements or post-retirement health coverage for our NEOs or other employees. In addition, we\ndo not provide matching contributions to the 401(k) plan or the deferred compensation plan for our NEOs or\nother employees.\nSeverance and Change in Control Arrangements\nWe offer severance benefits to our NEOs, including severance in connection with a change in control of\nMPS. In general, severance does not exceed six to twelve months of base salary, target bonus and other benefits,\nand is conditioned on a release of claims and compliance with ongoing obligations. We believe these modest\nbenefits balance the costs to MPS with the retention benefits that are commonly understood to come from\noffering severance and change in control benefits. For all change in control arrangements, the NEO is entitled to\nbenefits if his or her employment is terminated without cause or if he or she leaves for good reason within one\nyear following a change in control. This approach is commonly referred to as a “double-trigger” arrangement\nand is favored by many institutional investors and their advisors. We believe the size and conditions to receipt\nof these severance benefits are consistent with market practices. These arrangements are discussed in more\ndetail in “Named Executive Officer Compensation — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Termination\nUpon Change in Control.”\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nWe have stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs and directors. These guidelines reinforce the importance\nof aligning the interests of our NEOs and directors with the interests of our stockholders.\nFor the NEOs, the guidelines are determined as a multiple of each NEO’s base salary, and then converted to\na fixed number of shares. Currently, the multiple for our CEO is five times his base salary, while the multiples\nfor other NEOs are two times each NEO’s base salary.\nEquity interests that count toward the satisfaction of the ownership guideline include shares owned directly\nor indirectly by the executive, including restricted or unrestricted shares or stock units (excluding unearned\nrestricted shares or stock units that remain subject to achievement of performance goals), and any shares\nowned in our savings plans, such as our 401(k) plan, or acquired through our employee stock purchase plan.\nExecutives have five years from the date of adoption of the guidelines or their appointment as an executive\nofficer, as applicable, to attain these ownership levels. As of December 31, 2023, all of the NEOs met the stock\nownership guidelines.\nFor the non-employee directors, the stock ownership guidelines are determined as a multiple of the annual\nretainer paid to the non-employee director and then converted to a fixed number of shares. Currently, the\nrequired level for our non-employee directors is three times each director’s annual retainer. Directors have\n42\nfive years from the date of adoption of the guidelines or their initial appointment, as applicable, to attain these\nownership levels. As of December 31, 2023, all of the directors met the stock ownership guidelines.\nPolicy Regarding Clawback of Incentive Compensation\nIn October 2023, the Board adopted the Compensation Recoupment Policy to comply with Section 10D of\nthe Exchange Act and the NASDAQ listing standards as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The policy provides\nfor the recovery, in the event of a required accounting restatement, of certain variable incentive-based cash and\nequity compensation received by current or former executive officers (within the meaning of Rule 16a-1(f)\nunder the Exchange Act, and including our NEOs) that is based on erroneously reported financial information\nduring a three-year recovery period preceding a financial restatement, without regard to any taxes paid.\nThe amount recoverable is the payment that exceeds the amount of applicable performance-based incentive\ncompensation that would have been received by such executive officer during such recovery period had it been\ndetermined based on the relevant restated amounts, and recovery is subject to only limited exceptions. The\nrecovery of incentive-based compensation is required regardless of whether the executive officer engaged in any\nmisconduct or was at fault for the restatement. Performance-based incentive compensation potentially subject\nto recovery under the mandatory accounting restatement provisions of the policy is generally limited to any\ncompensation granted, earned or vested (on or after October 2, 2023) based wholly or in part on the attainment\nof one or more financial reporting measures, and “financial reporting measures” for these purposes includes\nstock price and TSR. Under the policy, we generally are not required to recover such excess compensation if\nthe Compensation Committee has made a determination that recovery would be impracticable and (1) we have\nalready attempted to recover such amount but the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing\nthe policy would exceed the amount to be recovered, (2) recovery would violate applicable home country law\nthat was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, or (3) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax qualified\nretirement plan to fail to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations. We are\nprohibited from indemnifying any executive officer against the loss of such recovered compensation. A copy of\nthe policy is filed as Exhibit 97.1 to our 2023 Annual Report.\nAnti-Hedging and Monetization, Short Sales and Other Transactions\nWe prohibit our directors, officers (including our NEOs), and other employees from engaging in hedging or\nmonetization transactions with respect to our stock that they obtained through our plans or otherwise, including\ntransactions involving the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars,\nforward sale contracts and exchange funds, without prior approval by the Chief Compliance Officer. We also\nprohibit our directors and officers (including our NEOs) from engaging in any short sales of our stock. In\naddition, our directors and officers are prohibited at all times from holding our stock in a margin account and\nfrom pledging our stock as collateral.\nTax and Accounting Impacts of Equity Grants\nSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a tax deduction for any publicly held corporation\nfor individual compensation exceeding $1 million in any taxable year for “covered employees,” which consist\nof all of the NEOs, including the Chief Financial Officer.\nOur Compensation Committee is aware of current rules governing the taxation and accounting for cash\nand equity compensation as applicable to public companies. Our Compensation Committee believes that, in\nestablishing the cash and equity incentive compensation plans and arrangements for our NEOs, the potential\ndeductibility of the compensation payable under those plans and arrangements should be only one of a number\nof relevant factors taken into consideration, and not the sole governing factor. The Compensation Committee\nbelieves it is important to maintain cash and equity incentive compensation at the requisite level to attract and\nretain the individuals essential to our financial success, even if all or part of that compensation may not be\ndeductible by reason of the Section 162(m) limitation.\n43\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with our\nmanagement. Based upon such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board\nthat the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting and\nincorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nMembers of the Compensation Committee:\nJeff Zhou, Chairman\nHerbert Chang\nEugen Elmiger\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNo Compensation Committee member was at any time during 2023, or at any other time, an officer or\nemployee of us or any of our subsidiaries. No NEO of MPS serves on the board or compensation committee of\nany entity that has one or more executive officers serving on the Board or Compensation Committee.\nCompensation Risk Management\nIn 2023, our management, including members from our internal legal, accounting, finance and human\nresources departments, undertook a subjective review of our compensation policies and practices that applied\nto all of our employees, including the following: annual base salaries and bonuses, equity incentive awards\nunder the Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Amended 2014 Equity Plan”) and the\nAmended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Amended 2004 ESPP”). This review was\ndesigned to review, consider and analyze the extent to which, if any, our compensation policies and practices\nmight create risks for us, and this review also focused on variable and incentive compensation elements, as\nwell as policies and practices that could mitigate or balance any such incentives. After conducting this review,\nmanagement determined that our compensation policies and practices for our employees do not create any risks\nthat are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. The results of the review and management’s\ndetermination were reviewed and independently considered by the Compensation Committee, which concurred\nwith management’s assessment.\n2023 Summary Compensation Table\nThe following table sets forth the compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer\nand the three other most highly compensated executive officers serving on December 31, 2023, which officers\ntogether constitute our NEOs:\nAll\nStock Non-Equity Incentive Other\nYear Salary ($) Bonus ($) Awards ($)(1)(2) Plan Compensation ($)(3) Compensation ($)(4) Total ($)\nMichael Hsing .............. 2023 822,877 — 12,311,787 1,508,805 — 14,643,469\nChief Executive Officer, President 2022 751,846 — 13,865,090 6,048,000 — 20,664,936\nand Chairman of the Board 2021 711,923 — 13,782,908 5,760,000 — 20,254,831\nBernie Blegen .............. 2023 400,054 — 3,486,353 733,537 — 4,619,944\nExecutive Vice President, Chief 2022 365,481 — 3,626,424 2,940,000 — 6,931,905\nFinancial Officer 2021 342,500 — 2,791,906 2,800,000 — 5,934,406\nDeming Xiao ............... 2023 434,296 — 5,144,271 796,314 — 6,374,881\nExecutive Vice President, Global 2022 396,808 — 5,539,193 3,192,000 — 9,128,001\nOperations 2021 375,385 — 4,243,375 3,040,000 — 7,658,760\nMaurice Sciammas .......... 2023 434,296 — 5,144,271 796,314 — 6,374,881\nExecutive Vice President, Worldwide 2022 396,808 — 5,539,193 3,192,000 — 9,128,001\nSales and Marketing 2021 375,385 — 4,243,375 3,040,000 — 7,658,760\nSaria Tseng ................ 2023 434,296 — 5,144,271 796,314 — 6,374,881\nExecutive Vice President, Strategic 2022 396,808 — 5,539,193 3,192,000 — 9,128,001\nCorporate Development and 2021 375,385 — 4,243,375 3,040,000 — 7,658,760\nGeneral Counsel\n44\n(1) For more information regarding the 2023 stock awards, refer to “Named Executive Officer\nCompensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis.” The amounts reflect the aggregate grant\ndate fair value of the 2023 PSUs computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718, excluding the impact of\nestimated forfeitures. The calculation of the grant date fair value was performed by a third-party valuation\nfirm using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions used in the calculation are included in Note 1 and\nNote 7 to the financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report.\n(2) Assuming the highest level of performance for the 2023 stock awards, the aggregate grant date\nfair value would be as follows: (a) $61,558,936 for Mr. Hsing, (b) $17,431,763 for Mr. Blegen,\n(c) $25,721,355 for Mr. Xiao, (d) $25,721,355 for Mr. Sciammas, and (e) $25,721,355 for Ms. Tseng.\nThere is no guarantee that the highest level of performance will be achieved by the NEOs.\n(3) The 2023 amounts reflect the short-term cash incentive compensation earned by the NEOs under our\nnon-equity incentive plan, as described under “Named Executive Officer Compensation — Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis.”\n(4) We did not provide other benefits or compensation for the NEOs that is required to be disclosed under Item\n402(c)(2)(ix) of Regulation S-K.\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nGrant Date\nFair Value of\nEstimated Possible Payouts Under Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Stock and\nNon-Equity Incentive Plan Awards(1) Incentive Plan Awards(2) Option\nName Grant Date Threshold ($) Target ($) Maximum ($) Threshold (#) Target (#) Maximum (#) Awards ($)(3)\nMichael Hsing ............... — — 1,663,200 6,652,800 — — — —\n2/7/2023 — — — — 27,365 136,825 12,311,787\nBernie Blegen ............... — — 808,600 3,234,400 — — — —\n2/7/2023 — — — — 7,749 38,745 3,486,353\nDeming Xiao ................ — — 877,800 3,511,200 — — — —\n2/7/2023 — — — — 11,434 57,170 5,144,271\nMaurice Sciammas ........... — — 877,800 3,511,200 — — — —\n2/7/2023 — — — — 11,434 57,170 5,144,271\nSaria Tseng ................. — — 877,800 3,511,200 — — — —\n2/7/2023 — — — — 11,434 57,170 5,144,271\n(1) The amounts reflect the threshold, target and maximum awards under the short-term cash\nincentive compensation program, which is described in detail in “Named Executive Officer\nCompensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”\n(2) The amounts reflect the threshold, target, and maximum number of the PSUs that may be earned based on\nthe achievement of specific goals under the long-term equity incentive compensation program, which is\ndescribed in detail in “Named Executive Officer Compensation —Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”\n(3) The amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards calculated in accordance with\nASC Topic 718, excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures.

This $30 purchase price requirement is deemed satisfied and waived if\nthe closing stock price on the last trading day of the performance period is $30 higher than the grant date\nstock price. The grant date fair value was $449.91 per share, which was calculated using a Monte Carlo\nsimulation model. Assumptions used in the calculation of the grant date fair value of the stock awards are\nincluded in Note 1 and Note 7 to the financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report.\n45\nNarrative Disclosure to 2023 Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards for the\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nA discussion of 2023 salaries, incentive plans and awards is set forth under “Named Executive Officer\nCompensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” including a discussion of the material terms\nand conditions of the short-term cash incentive compensation and the long-term equity compensation.\nFor information regarding our employment agreements with the NEOs, see “Named Executive Officer\nCompensation – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Termination Upon Change in Control – Employment\nAgreements and Change in Control Arrangements.”\nEquity Incentive Grant Policies\nWe maintain the Monolithic Power Systems Equity Award Grant Policy, which is designed to work in\nconcert with: (1) the administrative provisions of our Amended 2014 Equity Plan and such other plans as we\nmay adopt from time to time (which we refer to collectively as the Plans), (2) the requirements of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, (3) the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ, (4) applicable rules and\nregulations of the SEC, including those relating to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and (5) relevant sections\nof the Internal Revenue Code. Grants to our NEOs are made pursuant to this policy, must be approved by the\nCompensation Committee and will only be granted at specific times during the year, as described in further\ndetail below.\nPlan and Corporate Authorization\nUnder the Plans, the authorization to administer the grant of equity incentive awards is conferred upon the\nBoard or any committee of the Board as properly constituted under applicable laws. The Board has delegated\nto the Compensation Committee the authority to serve as administrator of the Plans (including the authority\nto grant awards under the Plans), and has approved a charter outlining the responsibilities of this committee\nwhich also includes this express authority. The delegation of authority to the Compensation Committee is not\nexclusive; the Board retains the right to formally approve award grants as well. The Compensation Committee\nmay form and delegate authority to subcommittees when appropriate.\nIn addition, the Board has delegated limited authority for grants of equity awards under the Plans to new\nemployees and consultants to a committee consisting of the Chief Executive Officer (which committee we refer\nto as the Equity Award Committee). The authority does not extend to grants to the NEOs. The delegation of\nauthority to the Equity Award Committee is not exclusive; the Board and Compensation Committee retain the\nright to formally approve award grants as well.\nEquity Grants to New Hires\nGrants to newly hired employees and consultants (other than Executive Officers as defined below) will\ngenerally be made on the date of the next regularly scheduled Board meeting subsequent to the employees’\nstart date. Management submits the employee equity award recommendations to the Compensation Committee\nand, if such equity awards are approved by the Compensation Committee, such equity awards will be granted\neffective as of the date of a meeting approving such awards as evidenced by written minutes of such meeting or\nthe date of the last verification signature or electronic verification over email in the event of a written consent in\nlieu of the meeting.\nNew hire grants made to “Executive Officers” (currently defined as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nFinancial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Operations Officer, President, employees who are members of\nthe Board and any other employee determined by the Board to be an Executive Officer) generally will only be\ngranted on the date of the next regularly scheduled Board meeting subsequent to the Executive Officer’s start\ndate and following the recommendation of such grant by the Compensation Committee.\n46\nEquity Grants to Existing Employees or Incumbent Members of the Board\nGenerally, annual grants of equity awards shall be made to key performers at a regularly scheduled Board\nmeeting. Equity awards to non-employee members of the Board shall be made by the Board or pursuant to any\nautomatic grant provisions in the Plans.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2023 Year-End\nThe following table sets forth, as to the NEOs, certain information regarding their outstanding stock awards\nas of December 31, 2023.

In addition, the MPSUs contain a post-vesting sales restriction for one year.\n(5) Reflects PSUs granted in February 2021. The performance goals with respect to the PSUs were achieved as\nof December 31, 2022. 50% of these PSUs vested in February 2023, and the remaining 50% vest quarterly\nover the following two years through February 2025, for a total vesting period of four years, subject to\ncontinued employment.\n(6) Reflects MSUs granted in October 2022 at the target level of performance.

Upon achievement of the pre-\ndetermined performance goals through the end of the performance period on December 31 2025, these\nPSUs will vest immediately, for a total vesting period of approximately three years, subject to continued\nemployment. See “Named Executive Officer Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis” for\nfurther discussion.\n2023 Option Exercises and Stock Vested\nThe following table sets forth certain information on the stock awards vested for our NEOs in 2023. There were\nno option exercises in 2023.\nStock Awards\nNumber of\nShares Acquired Value Realized on\nName on Vesting (#) Vesting ($)(1)\nMichael Hsing .......................................... 341,019 174,979,073\nBernie Blegen .......................................... 53,074 26,758,684\nDeming Xiao ........................................... 113,576 58,708,218\nMaurice Sciammas ...................................... 113,576 58,708,218\nSaria Tseng ............................................ 113,576 58,708,218\n(1) Value realized on vesting is equal to (a) the closing price of our Common Stock on the vesting date less any\npurchase price, multiplied by the number of shares that vested, plus (b) accumulated dividend equivalents\nattributable to such shares.\n48\nThe amount of realized value of the vested stock awards for our NEOs is directly linked to the significant\nincrease in our stock price during the vesting periods, thereby consistently creating significant long-\nterm value for our stockholders. Each year, based on feedback from our stockholders, the Compensation\nCommittee imposes substantial performance and vesting periods on all of our stock awards granted to the\nNEOs. For example, in 2023, a large portion (34%) of Mr. Hsing’s realized stock value was attributable to\nMSUs granted in December 2013 (“2013 MSUs”). These 2013 MSUs had a five-year performance period and,\nupon achievement of the market conditions, an additional five-year service condition, for a total of ten years.\nThe 2013 MSUs began vesting quarterly in March 2019 and our stock price has increased more than 2,000%\nfrom December 14, 2013 (the grant date) to December 31, 2023, as illustrated in the chart below:\n49\nAs a result of the significant stock price appreciation during the performance and vesting periods, the\nrealized value of the 2013 MSUs also increased when the shares began vesting in March 2019. Hypothetically,\nif our stock price had remained at the grant date level ($31.73), Mr. Hsing’s realized value for the 2013 MSUs\nwould have been significantly lower ($57 million less in 2023), as shown in the chart below:\nIn summary, we believe that our NEOs’ high realized pay in 2023 is in full alignment with long-term\nstockholder interests given that a significant portion of their realized pay is attributed to their stock awards\nearned based on strong company performance and being subject to long service-based vesting periods,\ncombined with our stock price increasing significantly during such periods.\n2023 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan\nWe have a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan, which allows key employees, including\nour NEOs, to defer the receipt of, and taxation on, cash compensation. Plan participants may defer up to 70%\nof their salary and up to 90% of their non-equity incentive plan compensation. Plan participants may elect\nto receive the deferred funds either in a lump sum or in annual installments of up to ten years, and to begin\nreceiving distributions either at retirement or at a future date not less than 24 months from the election date.\nInvestment returns on deferred balances are linked to the performance of the investment choices available in\nthe plan. We do not make contributions to the plan or guarantee returns on the investments. The following table\nsummarizes the non-qualified deferred compensation activity for our NEOs in 2023:\nExecutive Aggregate Aggregate\nContributions Earnings in Balance at\nName in Last FY ($)(1) Last FY ($)(2) Last FYE ($)(3)\nMichael Hsing ......................................... 2,340,734 1,130,120 20,487,353\nBernie Blegen ......................................... — 79,177 1,459,706\nDeming Xiao .......................................... 287,280 870,426 9,984,736\nMaurice Sciammas ..................................... 287,280 734,337 7,159,084\nSaria Tseng ........................................... 1,235,687 1,559,044 12,251,520\n50\n(1) All executive contributions are reported as salary or non-equity incentive plan compensation in “Named\nExecutive Officer Compensation — 2023 Summary Compensation Table.”\n(2) Represents the net amounts credited to the NEOs’ accounts as a result of the performance of their\ninvestment choices. The amounts are not included in “Named Executive Officer Compensation — 2023\nSummary Compensation Table” because plan earnings are not “preferential or above-market” under\nSEC rules.\n(3) Includes the following cumulative amounts reported as compensation for the NEOs in the Summary\nCompensation Tables for previous years: Mr. Hsing, $14,662,554; Mr. Blegen, $786,811; Mr. Xiao,\n$7,149,434; Mr. Sciammas, $5,429,201; and Ms. Tseng, $7,936,509.\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Termination Upon Change in Control\nEmployment Agreements and Change in Control Arrangements\nWe have entered into employment agreements with each of our NEOs. The employment agreements\nestablish the initial titles, salaries, and reporting responsibilities for the NEOs. The employment agreements also\nprovide that each NEO may participate in our equity, bonus and benefits programs. Each of the employment\nagreements with Mr. Hsing, Mr. Xiao and Mr. Sciammas was amended in December 2008 to bring the\nagreements into compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The employment agreement with\nMr. Xiao was subsequently amended in March 2011 to grant Mr. Xiao an equity interest in Hue Ming LLC,\na Delaware limited liability company formed by us, in connection with an ownership transfer of a corporate\napartment in Chengdu, China, to Mr. Xiao. The equity interest became fully vested in March 2016 and Hue\nMing LLC was dissolved.\nIn addition to the terms described above, the employment agreements also provide certain severance\nbenefits upon termination without cause or for good reason, including within one year following a change in\ncontrol (a “Change in Control with Termination”), as described in the following table. We have followed general\nmarket practices for senior executives in allowing limited change in control arrangements for selected officers.\nTermination without Cause or Change in Control\nNEOs

still in progress,\na pro-rata portion of such awards shall vest to the extent the applicable performance levels are achieved\nthrough the date of the change in control, in accordance with the individual grant agreements. With respect\nto the MSUs that have not been earned because the performance period is still in progress, such awards\nshall vest if the per-share price paid in the change in control is greater than the price targets. In addition, the\nrelative TSR market condition will be deemed satisfied, in accordance with the individual grant agreements.\nEach of the employment agreements with our NEOs also contains a provision whereby during the period\nof employment and thereafter, the executive shall not, without the prior written consent of us, disclose or use\nany confidential information or proprietary data other than for our interest. These employment agreements\nalso contain a covenant not to solicit, beginning with the date of the executive’s termination and until one year\nthereafter.\nA “change in control” of MPS means a merger or consolidation after which our stockholders do not hold\na majority of our outstanding voting securities, any transaction involving the transfer of greater than 50%\nof our voting power (unless otherwise provided for in an award agreement), a change in the composition of\nthe Board occurring within a 12-month period, as a result of which less than a majority of the directors are\nincumbent directors (as such term is defined in the employment agreements), or a sale of all or substantially\nall our assets. “Cause” generally means the NEO’s failure to perform the duties or responsibilities of his or\nher employment, the NEO personally engaging in illegal conduct that is detrimental to us, the NEO being\nconvicted of or pleading nolo contendere to a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude, or the NEO\ncommitting a material act of dishonesty, fraud or misappropriation of property. “Good Reason” generally means\nthe NEO’s termination of employment following the expiration of an applicable cure period (as designated in\n53\neach employment agreement) following the occurrence of: a material reduction in compensation (except where\na substantially equivalent reduction is applied to all our officers), a material, adverse reduction in the NEO’s\nauthority, responsibilities or duties, or a material change in the location at which the NEO performs services.\nEstimated Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control with Termination\nThe following table sets forth the estimated payments required to be made to each NEO in connection with\nthe termination of his or her employment upon specified events, assuming a stock price of $630.78 per share,\nthe closing price as of December 29, 2023 (the last business day of 2023). The estimated amounts shown also\nassume that the termination was effective as of December 29, 2023, and include estimates of severance benefits\nwhich would be paid to the executives upon their termination.

In the event of the NEOs’ death or disability, except as required by applicable law,\nwe will have no obligation to pay or provide any compensation or benefits under the employment agreements\nbetween us and the NEOs.\nCEO Pay Ratio\nFor 2023, our CEO pay ratio was determined as follows:\n• The annual total compensation of our CEO was $14,643,469 as reported in the “Total” column in the\n2023 Summary Compensation Table disclosed above.\n• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees (other than our CEO) was $49,493. The\nmedian employee was located in China.\n• The ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation\nof all employees was 296 to 1. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent\nwith Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.\nTo determine the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, we applied the following\nmethodologies and assumptions:\n• We selected December 31, 2023 as the date for purposes of establishing the employee population used in\nidentifying the median employee.\n• As of December 31, 2023, our global headcount consisted of approximately 3,500 permanent and\ntemporary employees, with a majority of these employees located in international locations with various\nmarket wages and cost of living standards. All of these employees were included in the employee\npopulation used in identifying the median employee.\n• We used payroll and equity plan records for the twelve-month period from January 1, 2023 to December\n31, 2023. The components of annual compensation included base salary, sales commissions, bonuses,\nthe grant date fair value of stock awards and certain employee benefits.\n54\n• Total compensation was annualized for permanent employees who commenced employment during the\nyear. Total compensation was not annualized for temporary employees.\n• No cost-of-living or other adjustments permissible by the SEC rules were made.\nThe SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s\nannual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions,\nand to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. Therefore, the pay\nratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies\nmay have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies,\nexclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.\nAlternative Measure:\nAs discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section above, more than 94% of our CEO’s\nannual compensation was tied to rigorous performance conditions in 2023, while the annual compensation of\nour median employee was not tied to performance goals. Accordingly, as an alternative measure, management\nbelieves that a more direct and meaningful pay ratio is to compare compensation that is not tied to any\nperformance objectives. Based on this method, our alternative CEO pay ratio was determined as follows:\n• The alternative annual total compensation of our CEO was $822,877 (consisting of his cash salary\nfor 2023).\n• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees (other than our CEO) remained $49,493.\n• The ratio of the alternative annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total\ncompensation of all employees was 17 to 1.\nPay Versus Performance\nThe following Pay Versus Performance information presents the compensation of our NEOs disclosed in\nthe Summary Compensation Table (“SCT”), as well as compensation actually paid (“CAP”) to our NEOs and\ncertain performance measure results prepared in accordance with Item 402(v) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nAs discussed further below, the CAP amounts do not necessarily represent actual compensation earned or\nrealized by our NEOs in a given year. The Compensation Committee did not consider the Pay Versus Performance\ninformation in making its compensation decisions for our NEOs.

The grant date\nfair value for these awards was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions used in\nthe grant date valuation are disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. For equity awards vested during the\napplicable Covered Year, the fair value was based on the closing stock price plus accumulated dividend\nequivalents at the vesting date. For outstanding equity awards for which the performance conditions have\nnot been achieved, the year-end fair value was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The\nincreases or decreases in the year-end fair value were mainly driven by changes in our stock price. For\noutstanding equity awards for which all the performance conditions have been achieved but additional\ntime-based service conditions are required, the year-end fair value was based on the closing stock price plus\naccumulated dividend equivalents.\n(3) For purposes of this tabular disclosure, our peer group represents the PHLX Index, which we also disclose\nin the stock performance graph required by Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K included in our 2023 Annual\nReport. For each Covered Year, our TSR and our peer group’s TSR were calculated as the cumulative TSR\nfrom December 31, 2019 through the last day of the applicable Covered Year, assuming that $100 was\ninvested on December 31, 2019. Because fiscal years are presented in the table in reverse chronological\norder (from top to bottom), the table should be read from bottom to top for purposes of understanding\ncumulative returns over time.\n(4) The amounts represent GAAP net income.\n56\n(5) In our assessment, the Company-Selected Measure is our revenue growth rate, which represents the most\nimportant financial performance measure used by us to link CAP to our NEOs for 2023 to our performance.\nRefer to “Named Executive Officer Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis” for further\ndiscussion. Revenue growth rate represents the year-over-year percentage increase in GAAP revenue.\nWhile the performance measure under our long-term equity compensation program for 2023 is based on\nthe average of our three-year revenue growth rate, the Company-Selected Measure presented in the table\ncovers our one-year revenue growth rate for each applicable Covered Year in accordance with SEC rules.\nRelationship Between CAP and Performance Measures\nBecause our executive compensation program is significantly comprised of performance-based equity\nawards, the primary determinants of the CAP amounts, as calculated under SEC rules, are our stock price, actual\npayouts from awards vested during the applicable Covered Year, and the number of outstanding awards based\non projected and actual performance achievement. As shown in the table above, the CAP amounts include year-\nend revaluations of equity awards granted in the applicable Covered Year, plus the year-over-year changes in the\nfair value of vested and outstanding equity awards granted in multiple historical years, all of which are heavily\nimpacted by the performance of our stock price.\nRelationship Between CAP and TSR:\nThe following chart compares the CAP amounts to the cumulative TSR since December 31, 2019,\nmeasured as of the last day of each Covered Year.\n57\nRelationship Between CAP and Net Income:\nThe following chart compares the CAP amounts to our net income for each Covered Year.\nNet income is not a direct performance measure in our executive compensation program. However, we use\nnon-GAAP operating income as the performance measure in our short-term cash incentive plan. Net income\nand non-GAAP operating income metrics measure different levels of our profitability. The CAP amounts do not\nalways correlate to our profitability because our executive compensation program is heavily weighted towards\nlong-term equity awards, which could vary significantly in value with changes to our stock price.\n58\nRelationship Between CAP and Company-Selected Measure:\nThe following chart compares the CAP amounts to the Company-Selected Measure for each Covered Year.\nWhile the performance measure for our 2023 equity awards takes into consideration the average of our\nthree-year revenue growth rate, we presented our one-year revenue growth rate as the Company-Selected\nMeasure in accordance with SEC rules. In addition, since our executive compensation program is heavily\nweighted towards long-term equity awards, the CAP calculations in any Covered Year are largely impacted by\nchanges to our stock price.\nPerformance Measures\nThe following list includes the financial performance measures that, in our assessment, represent the most\nimportant financial performance measures used by us to link CAP to our NEOs for 2023 to our performance.\nThese measures are not ranked.\n1. Revenue growth rate\n2. Non-GAAP operating income\n3. Manufacturing capacity outside of China\n59\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nThe following table summarizes certain information under our equity compensation plans as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\nNumber of\nsecurities\nremaining\nNumber of available for\nsecurities to future issuance\nbe issued upon Weighted- under equity\nexercise of average compensation\noutstanding exercise price plans (excluding\noptions, of outstanding securities\nwarrants and options, warrants reflected in\nPlan Category rights (#)(a) and rights ($)(b) column (a)) (#)(c)\nEquity compensation plans approved by stockholders(1) .... 2,086,000(2) 30.00(3) 8,553,000(4)\n(1) Our equity compensation plans approved by stockholders include the following:\n(i) Amended 2014 Equity Plan, which became effective in June 2020 and provides for the issuance of\nup to 10.5 million shares. The Amended 2014 Equity Plan has a ten-year term and will expire in\nJune 2030.\n(ii) Amended 2004 ESPP, which became effective in August 2023 and provides for the issuance of up to\n4.4 million shares. The Amended 2004 ESPP has a 15-year term and will expire in August 2038.\n(2) Includes the following outstanding awards: 102,000 RSUs, 427,000 PSUs, 1,502,000 MSUs, and 55,000\nMPSUs. The number of securities reported for performance awards was generally based on the actual\nnumber of shares that have been earned, but are subject to additional service conditions before they\nvest. For those performance awards that have not been earned because the performance period was still\nin progress, the number of securities reported was based on the probable outcome of the performance\nconditions, and thus may differ from eventual dilution.\n(3) RSUs, MSUs and MPSUs have no purchase price. PSUs require employees to pay MPS $30 per share upon\nvesting of the shares. However, this purchase price requirement for the PSUs is waived if certain price\ntargets are met during the performance period.\n(4) Includes 4,153,000 shares that remained available for future issuance under the Amended 2014 Equity Plan\n(all of which may be subject to awards other than options, warrants and other rights), and 4,400,000 shares\nthat remained available for future issuance under the Amended 2004 ESPP.\nAudit Committee Report\nThe purpose of the Audit Committee is to provide oversight of our accounting and financial reporting\nprocesses and the audit of our financial statements, appoint the independent registered public accounting firm\nto audit our financial statements, and assist the Board in the oversight of: (i) the integrity of our financial\nstatements, (ii) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) the independent registered public\naccounting firm’s qualifications, independence and performance, and (iv) our internal accounting and financial\ncontrols. In addition, the Audit Committee provides the Board with such information and materials as it may\ndeem necessary to make the Board aware of financial matters requiring the attention of the Board.\nThe Audit Committee has a duly adopted charter, which it reviews on an annual basis.\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board that our financial statements be\nincluded in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Audit Committee took a number of steps in making this\nrecommendation for 2023, including:\n• reviewing and discussing the audited financial statements with our independent registered public\naccounting firm and management;\n60\n• discussing with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed\nby Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board; and\n• receiving the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm\nrequired by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding\nthe independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee\nconcerning independence, and discussing with the independent registered public accounting firm their\nindependence.\nBased upon the reviews and discussions described in this report, the Audit Committee recommended to the\nBoard that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 for filing with the SEC.\nMembers of the Audit Committee (as of the date the actions above were taken):\nVictor K. Lee, Chairman\nHerbert Chang\nEileen Wynne\nJeff Zhou\n61\nPROPOSAL FOUR\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL TO ELECT EACH DIRECTOR ANNUALLY\nThe following stockholder proposal has been submitted to us by John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue,\nNo. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278 (the “Proponent”). In accordance with SEC regulations, the Proponent has\nsubmitted documentation indicating that he is the beneficial owner of 15 shares of our Common Stock and he\nintends to continue to hold the requisite amount of shares through the date of the Annual Meeting. The complete\ntext of the stockholder proposal is reproduced verbatim as submitted to us. All statements contained in the\nstockholder proposal are the sole responsibility of the Proponent.\nFor the reasons set forth following the Proponent’s proposal, our Board opposes adoption of the proposal\nand recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.\nProponent’s Proposal\nProposal 4 – Elect Each Director Annually\nRESOLVED, shareholders ask that our Company take all the steps necessary to reorganize the\nBoard of Directors in order that each director stands for election at each annual meeting.\nAlthough our management can adopt this proposal topic in one-year and one-year implementation is a best\npractice, this proposal allows the option to phase it in.\nClassified Boards like the Monolithic Power Systems Board have been found to be one of 6 entrenching\nmechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to “What Matters in Corporate\nGovernance” by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School.\nArthur Levitt, former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said, “In my view it’s best for\nthe investor if the entire board is elected once a year. Without annual election of each director shareholders have\nfar less control over who represents them.”\nA total of 79 S&P 500 and Fortune 500 companies, worth more than $1 trillion, have adopted this important\nproposal topic since 2012. Annual election of each director could make directors more accountable, and thereby\ncontribute to improved performance and increased company value at virtually no extra cost to shareholders.\nThus it was not a surprise that this proposal topic won more than 96%-support at both Centene Corporation and\nTeleflex in 2021.\nAnnual election of each director gives shareholders more leverage if the Board of Directors performs\npoorly. For instance if the Board of Directors approves executive pay that is excessive or is poorly incentivized\nshareholders can soon vote against the Board’s executive pay committee members instead of potentially waiting\n3-years under the current setup.\nFor instance MPWR executive pay was rejected by 43% of shares in 2023 in spite of management using\nshareholder money for an extra promotion for the excessive executive pay that was ultimately rejected by 42%\nof shares when a 5% rejection is often the norm at well performing companies.\nConsequently the members of the MPWR executive pay committee deserved negative votes but under the\n3-year director terms at MPWR none of these 3 directors were on the 2023 annual meeting ballot.\n62\nHowever the 2 directors on the 2023 annual meeting ballot, Mr. James Moyer and Mr. Victor Lee, each\nreceived 22% in negative votes when 5% in negative votes is often the norm at well performing companies. To\nmake matters whose Mr. Moyer at age 81 is now elected to serve until age 83 with no intervening opportunity\nfor shareholders to vote against Mr. Moyer. Due to poor health Mr. Moyer missed 2 Board meetings which is all\nthe worse because the Monolithic Power Systems board has only 8 directors.\nPlease vote yes:\nELECT EACH DIRECTOR ANNUALLY - PROPOSAL 4\nBoard’s Opposing Statement\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal requesting that we take all necessary\nsteps to declassify our Board.\nOur Board believes that there is no “one size fits all” governance approach. The appropriate standard by which to\njudge MPS’s classified board structure is whether it protects the interests of our stockholders.\nOur Board does not believe that declassifying our Board is in the best interest of MPS and stockholders for\nthe following reasons:\n1. Our Classified Board Structure Reduces our Vulnerability to Takeovers and Protects Stockholder Value.\nOur classified board structure reduces our vulnerability to coercive takeover tactics and inadequate takeover\nbids by encouraging persons seeking control of MPS to negotiate with our Board, and thereby better positions\nour Board to negotiate effectively on behalf of all our stockholders. Our classified board structure is designed\nto safeguard against an insurgent stockholder replacing a majority of our directors with its own nominees at a\nsingle annual meeting of stockholders, thereby gaining control of MPS and assets without paying fair value to\nour stockholders. In particular, in recent years, hedge funds and other activist investors have increasingly used\nthe threat of a proxy fight to pressure boards to take actions that produce short-term gains at the expense of\nstrategies designed to achieve meaningful long-term stockholder value. Because only approximately one-third\nof our directors are elected at any annual meeting of stockholders, at least two annual meetings of stockholders\nwould be required to change a majority of the directors serving on our Board, providing incumbent directors\nsubstantial leverage to negotiate the best results for our stockholders.\nOur classified board structure does not preclude a takeover, but rather provides our Board the time and\nflexibility necessary to be in the best position to evaluate the adequacy and fairness of proposed offers, consider\nalternative methods of maximizing stockholder value, protect all stockholders against abusive tactics during a\ntakeover process and, as appropriate, negotiate the best possible return for all stockholders, without the threat\nof imminent removal of a majority of the members of our Board. We believe this is particularly important in\nthe current environment of stock market volatility, in which persons seeking to gain control of a company\nmay pursue coercive takeover tactics during a period of depressed stock prices, even where the decline in the\ncompany’s stock price may be temporary and due to factors outside of its control. The closing price of our\nCommon Stock has ranged from $342.95 to $637.39 per share during 2023, and $571.06 to $767.60 per share\nduring the three-month period from December 15, 2023 to March 15, 2024, which illustrates how attractive\nand vulnerable we might be to an opportunistic acquirer seeking to acquire our Common Stock at a time\nwhen our intrinsic value may not be fully reflected in our Common Stock. Elimination of our classified board\nstructure would make it more difficult for our stockholder-elected Board to preserve and maximize value for all\nstockholders in the event of an unsolicited takeover bid.\n2. Our Classified Board Structure Promotes Independence, Stability, Continuity and Experience.\nWe are committed to strong corporate governance and our Board regularly reviews our governance\nstructure, including our classified board structure. Our Board is divided into three classes, with each class\nserving a staggered three-year term. Electing directors to three-year terms, rather than one-year terms, enhances\nthe independence of our non-management directors and encourages them to make decisions in the long-\n63\nterm best interest of our company and stockholders. This reduces the potential influence of certain investors\nand special interest groups with short-term agendas that may be harmful to the long-term interests of MPS\nand stockholders. This long-term perspective differentiates MPS from other companies, and we believe this\nperspective is a significant reason why our stock price has increased by 1,900% in the past ten years (from\nDecember 31, 2013 to December 31, 2023).\nOur classified board structure also promotes orderly succession of directors by ensuring that at any given\ntime there are experienced, tenured directors serving on our Board who are familiar with MPS and its business,\nstrategic goals, history, technology, operations, culture and employee base. We believe three-year terms enable\nour directors to develop substantive knowledge about our complex business and operations, which enables them\nto make long-term strategic decisions that are in the best interest of our stockholders. Currently, our Board is\ncomprised of individuals with the following tenures:\nName Director Since\nMichael Hsing ................................................................. 1997\nHerbert Chang ................................................................. 1999\nEugen Elmiger ................................................................ 2012\nVictor K. Lee .................................................................. 2006\nCarintia Martinez .............................................................. 2021\nJames C. Moyer ............................................................... 1998\nEileen Wynne ................................................................. 2023\nJeff Zhou ..................................................................... 2010\nWe believe our Board strikes an appropriate balance between directors with long-term institutional\nknowledge of MPS and new directors with fresh perspectives. If our Board were declassified, in a single\nelection cycle it could be wholly replaced by directors unfamiliar with our history, business and strategies,\nresulting in a significant loss of critical institutional knowledge. Our classified board structure allows for orderly\nchange, with new directors with fresh perspectives benefitting from serving with directors with longer tenures.\nOur Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews succession planning for our Board,\nintends to implement a policy regarding director time commitments and plans to establish an advisory board to\nassist us in various areas of our business and to provide potential candidates to join the Board over time.\nCompetition for qualified directors in our industry is intense and increases each year. Our classified board\nstructure assists us in attracting and retaining highly qualified directors by increasing the likelihood that they\nwill have sufficient time to immerse themselves in our business and operations and execute on important\nlong-term initiatives. Our classified board structure also requires a higher level of commitment from our newly\nappointed directors, as they are generally expected to serve up to a three-year first term.\n3. Our Classified Board Structure Provides Accountability to Our Stockholders.\nSince becoming a public company, our Board has been comprised of a majority of independent, non-\nemployee directors and each of our board committees has always consisted entirely of independent directors.\nWe have adopted director membership criteria to help ensure that the nominees to our Board reflect our\nhigh governance standards and are prepared to serve the best interests of all of our stockholders. We believe\nthat our corporate governance practices reflect our commitment to accountability and serve the interests of\nour stockholders.\nIn addition, all directors, regardless of the length of their term, have a fiduciary duty under the law to act\nin a manner that they believe to be in the best interests of MPS and our stockholders. Accountability depends\non the selection of experienced and committed individuals, not on whether they serve terms of one year or\nthree years. As a result, the classified board structure maintains the same level of accountability as with annual\nelections of directors.\n64\nAfter careful consideration, our Board has determined that continuation of our classified board structure is\nappropriate and in the best long-term interests of MPS and our stockholders.\nOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL FOUR.\nOther Matters\nWe know of no other matters to be submitted at the meeting. If any other matters properly come before the\nmeeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy to vote the shares they represent\nas we may recommend.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis Proxy Statement contains forward-looking statements, as that term is defined in the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts or guarantees of future\nperformance or events, are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs, assumptions, goals, and objectives,\nand involve significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results\nto be materially different from the results expressed by these statements. Readers of this Proxy Statement are\ncautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date\nhereof. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those identified in\nour SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2023 Annual Report. The forward-looking statements in this\nProxy Statement represent our projections and current expectations, as of the date hereof, not predictions of\nactual performance.\nBY ORDER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nDated: April 29, 2024\nSaria Tseng\nExecutive Vice President, Strategic\nCorporate Development, General Counsel\nand Corporate Secretary\n65\nAnnexure A\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP MEASURES(1)\n(in thousands, except per-share amounts)\nFY 2023 FY 2022 FY 2021\nGAAP operating income ....................................... $481,736 $526,785 $262,417\nStock-based compensation expense ......................... 149,711 160,992 123,479\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets ............ 132 132 44\nDeferred compensation plan expense (income) ................ 9,561 (7,011) 5,124\nNon-GAAP operating income ................................... 641,140 680,898 391,064\nLitigation expense ....................................... 6,891 8,001 9,225\nNon-GAAP operating income used in short-term cash incentive plan .... $648,031 $688,899 $400,289\nGAAP net income ............................................ $427,374 $437,672 $242,023\nStock-based compensation expense ......................... 149,711 160,992 123,479\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets ............ 132 132 44\nDeferred compensation plan expense (income) ................ 1,055 (411) 561\nTax effect ..............................................

MPS utilizes both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to assess what it believes to\nbe its core operating performance, and to evaluate and manage its internal business and assist in making\nfinancial, operating and compensation decisions. Our Compensation Committee also evaluates non-GAAP\nfinancial measures when reviewing management’s performances and reaching compensation decisions.\nMPS believes that the non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP measures, provide investors\nwith an alternative presentation useful to their understanding of MPS’s core operating results and trends.\nAdditionally, MPS believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures, together with GAAP measures,\nmay provide investors with an additional dimension of comparability to similar companies. However,\ninvestors should be aware that non-GAAP financial measures utilized by other companies are not likely to\nbe comparable in most cases to the non-GAAP financial measures used by MPS.\n66\nThis page intentionally left blank.\nThis page intentionally left blank."
