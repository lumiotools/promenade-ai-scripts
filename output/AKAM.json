In this role, Mr. Karon oversees company strategy and product direction for our media delivery, web performance, cloud computing solutions, and Akamai Connected Cloud to help businesses deliver immersive online experiences with performance, scale, reliability, and simplicity across diverse application architectures. \n\nShare\n\n![](/site/en/images/blog/2022/Linode.png)\n\nThis Tuesday,[ Akamai announced](https://www.ir.akamai.com/news-releases/news-release-details/akamai-acquire-linode-provide-businesses-developer-friendly-and) our intent to acquire [Linode](/solutions/cloud-computing). The acquisition is intended to create the world’s most distributed compute platform. This new cloud to edge platform will make it easier for developers and businesses to build, run, and secure applications, especially given the complexities of Web3. Decentralized apps and data, new experiences like the metaverse, and token based economies backed by blockchain require applications that are easy to deploy, fast moving, and secure. The simplest solution is an accessible, seamless continuum of compute, which will be provided by Akamai and Linode. The possibilities for cloud to edge compute enabled applications are as endless as they are exciting.\n\nOne thing this acquisition is not about is turning Linode away from small businesses and pivoting to enterprises. By adding Akamai’s scale, distribution and security, Akamai and Linode can help more developers create more applications of all shapes and sizes.\n\nChris Aker, Linode’s CEO,[ said](https://www.linode.com/blog/linode/linode-and-akamai/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=akamai) that to deliver the best possible customer experience, Linode would need more network, security, and scale. These are hallmarks of Akamai’s business, and something we believe we do better than anyone. Akamai's CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton, highlighted that our primary objective is to scale up Linode, while integrating its compute, storage and networking capabilities into Akamai’s Intelligent Edge platform. This can provide a more comprehensive solution for every customer of Akamai and Linode, from large enterprise customers to Linode's customers today.\n\nLike any acquisition, this deal is about bringing two things together. With Linode, Akamai will create several 1+1=3 value propositions: \n\n  1. A better solution for developers and businesses\n\n  2. A more attractive cloud infrastructure and platform service\n\n  3. The most distributed cloud to edge compute platform in the world\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers, and businesses, want to build on platforms that are simple, integrated and can be managed as a single offering. Today’s digital businesses are building increasingly complex applications. Connected, individualized experiences must be fast, reliable, and secure. This increasingly requires massive amounts of compute power. And this, in turn, is pushing applications and data to the edge. The edge is where these experiences are consumed and created. This push requires a wider span of resiliency, reach, low latency, and security. Akamai's goal is to ensure developers have access to the right compute tools no matter where they are in their cloud journey. Creating the world’s most distributed compute platform meets those needs. \n\nAkamai has long supported multi-platform and multi-cloud architectures. With Linode, as we enter the cloud market, this will expand. Today[ 92 percent](https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud) of enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy. 61 percent of organizations plan to optimize cloud costs. Linode's focus has been on offering simple, affordable, accessible compute and storage. Customers recognize Linode as a[ leading infrastructure as a service](https://www.g2.com/categories/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas?tab=highest_rated) (IaaS) provider, and the[ easiest to use](https://www.g2.com/categories/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas?tab=easiest_to_use). Businesses across the world are striving to streamline processes. This, in turn, will reduce technical skills gaps. They will prioritize cloud providers that provide the end-to-end capabilities their applications require. Akamai can capture that demand with our[ category leading](/company/our-awards \"Our Awards\") delivery and security solutions coupled with Linode’s compute and storage capabilities. Together, we will create a set of solutions from the cloud to the edge that other cloud providers cannot match.\n\nAkamai has been innovating in[ edge computing for 20 years](/blog/news/20-years-of-edge-computing \"20 Years of Edge Computing\"). Our most recent innovation has been providing low-latency [serverless compute](/solutions/edge/serverless-computing). This works well for solutions like Vaccine Edge, a solution we created in partnership with Queue-IT. Serverless is a powerful solution when proximity and low latency are required. Many developers need a mix of low latency and robust compute resources. Today, cloud compute and serverless do not provide that. Until today, Akamai has been providing custom compute solutions for our customers on our private cloud. We host virtual machines running our customers' code on our platform. One such implementation is enabling a popular direct-to-consumer video service to stream a major sporting season. With Linode, we will be able to offer a continuum of compute. We will continue to offer public cloud compute and storage resources to everyone. But we will bring that compute closer to the edge as well, and add scale. And we will continue to offer serverless compute as well.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Akamai’s future as the world’s most distributed compute platform - from cloud to edge - is bright. Linode will continue to offer the solutions developers love as they always have. Together we will scale and distribute those solutions to reach even more developers. This isn’t about turning away from small businesses and pivoting to enterprises. Developers are the key to building killer applications for the world's leading businesses. So we are committed to continue to focus on delivering great experiences for developers as Linode has. As Akamai continues to pursue our mission to power and protect life online, we are confident that with Linode we will be better positioned than ever to make life better for billions of people, billions of times a day.\n\n  * [Company](/blog?filter=blogs/company)\n  * [Developers](/blog?filter=blogs/developers)\n  * [Edge](/blog?filter=blogs/edge)\n  * [News](/blog?filter=blogs/news)\n\n\n\nShare\n\n![Adam Karon](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/Adam%20Karon%202022.jpeg)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Adam Karon](/blog?author=adam_karon)\n\nFebruary 17, 2022\n\n![Adam Karon](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/Adam%20Karon%202022.jpeg)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Adam Karon](/blog?author=adam_karon)\n\nAdam Karon is Akamai's Chief Operating Officer and General Manager of the Cloud Technology Group.

Part 2: Edge Computing\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nDecember 08, 2020\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nAri Weil is the VP of Product Marketing at Akamai Technologies.\n\nShare\n\n![](/site/en/images/blog/header-images/eng_header_image095.png)\n\n[In part 1 of this series](/blog/edge/can-edge-computing-exist-without-the-edge-part-1-the-edge), I drew the architectural distinction between a centralized cloud platform and a distributed edge network. This is an important foundation upon which to explain the difference between cloud computing and edge computing. The two serve very different and complementary purposes. However, in my experience, business leaders, product owners, and application developers often mistake them as competitive.\n\nMost businesses are still trying to understand the use cases where edge computing makes sense to them. According to [Gartner](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/will-edge-computing-become-the-new-cloud-in-2021/), Enterprises that have deployed edge use cases in production will grow from about 1% in 2018 to about 40% in 2024. The use cases that require edge computing versus cloud computing will come down to economics. There are some forms of compute that don't make sense at the edge, just as there are edge computing use cases where low-latency requirements obviate centralizing computing in the cloud. \n\nEdge computing is deﬁned as \"a part of a distributed computing topology in which information processing is located close to the edge -- where things and people produce or consume that information.\" It's how the physical and digital world interact at the edge. Edge computing translates those interactions into data, which can be used to make a decision, look for patterns, or pass the data back to a storage or analytics application for further analysis. \n\nLatency is one of the primary value drivers for edge computing. Data that should be managed in the cloud is longer lived and offers sustained value; if data is still valuable after being at rest for several hours or several months, then the heavy storage and compute infrastructure in the cloud is appropriate. Conversely, the noisy data that is generated through interactions at the edge requires real-time processing to provide value; if data is ephemeral and requires decisions and actions while it is in motion, then the lightweight, localized compute resources at the edge are best. Let's consider two common examples.\n\nAs broadcasters shift to digital, they must understand subscriber preferences to design programming and ensure flawless viewing experiences. The former is only really possible with data at rest. Data must be collected from a global base, then stored and processed to determine what content to create and how to produce it given the demographics of the subscriber base. Conversely, providing those subscribers with fast startup times and error-free viewing, in their local area, [on the device](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015-11-forecaster-our-experimental-object-based-weather-forecast) they use, over their specific network connection, requires real-time monitoring, processing, and actions. Value in the former case is measured in months and years, whereas in the latter, value is created or lost in milliseconds.\n\nSimilarly, retailers must understand customer preferences for omnichannel shopping experiences over thousands of interactions to design storefronts and offers that convert customers and maximize their lifetime value. These decisions cannot be made based on individual actions or in real time. This data is also only available at rest, through creating shopper cohorts and personas where merchandise can be presented and promoted to drive purchasing decisions. Assembling that information and adapting it -- based on whether the shopper is in a store or online, which device they are using, and how the e-commerce application is behaving in the moment -- requires real-time computing to maximize conversions. \n\nUnderstanding when and where data is valuable is critical, given that estimates describe 50% of enterprise data being generated outside of core data centers by 2023. Businesses must appreciate where the cloud and the edge provide unique value, and then architect their infrastructure and applications appropriately to capture it. Data that maintains its value at rest will be prohibitively expensive to manage and secure at the edge because doing so will create redundancies that the centralized cloud is designed to overcome. Real-time hyperlocal data sent back to the cloud from the edge will fail to capture value while running up costs because round trips will add latency and errors that result in poor user experiences. \n\nSaid simply, if action needs to be taken based on data that is changing in real time, start with edge computing. If data can or must be aggregated, processed, and analyzed to be able to provide value, start with cloud computing.\n\n[We previously established](/blog/edge/can-edge-computing-exist-without-the-edge-part-1-the-edge) that cloud providers cannot truly provide edge capabilities unless they deploy their services to the edge. We also discussed how Akamai has architected and built a distributed edge platform. Although Akamai pioneered the content delivery network (CDN) market, it was simply the first revenue-generating use case built on our distributed edge network. Since then, competitors building CDNs have pursued centralized models, just as centralized cloud platforms have added CDN capabilities to their platforms. The primary difference is realized as companies look to provide consistent scale and capabilities at low latency wherever they do business. Centralized architectures can only satisfy all of those requirements near where they've deployed their hardware.\n\nCDN providers with centralized infrastructures cannot maintain the promise of low-latency data processing that edge use cases demand, globally. One CDN provider attempted to suggest that the edge provides limited value (though they have since co-opted the term) using this analogy: The edge is like a convenience store, closer to a person's home but with a limited set of items for sale. If a person drives a few more miles to a supermarket, they can get all of their groceries in one trip. There are two problems with this analogy: \n\n  * It attempts to address a latency challenge with capacity alone, when it is a well-accepted fact that distance adds latency, so it's faster to travel between two points that are closer together. So regardless of the capacity for a given location, the fact that those locations only exist in 23 countries vs. Akamai's 136 means that, in relative terms, at a minimum 113 countries will suffer from increased latency.\n\n  * It assumes that every consumer only has access to a single convenience store, when in reality the edge is about having many nearby specialty stores that allow for the optimal shopping experience and very quick round trips, depending upon what you need. Akamai maintains over 4,100 locations to make available the right compute resources and data where our customers' customers need them.\n\n\n\n\nToday, people and things, as well as systems of both, interact with one another, which presents new opportunities for edge computing solutions to provide value in layers of hardware, software, and code. IDC forecasts that enterprises will invest as much as $250.6 billion on edge computing by 2024. Capturing this value demands that the edge be well understood, that edge platforms provide both integrated services and integrations with other ecosystem providers, and that businesses appreciate when latency and digital transformation require centralization vs. distribution to capture value. \n\nToday, Akamai is working across a broad spectrum of use cases, including many of those mentioned above, as we help to grow and develop edge computing use cases with our customers. Our platform team is working closely with hardware providers, as well as internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile network operators (MNOs), to help ensure that [edge networking is ready to enable 5G](https://www.businesschief.com/technology-and-ai/akamai-technologies-key-steps-support-5g-technology), and our carrier team is complementing that with solutions designed to maintain [mobile device security](/blog/news/5g-security-iot-asavie-and-akamai). Our product teams working with leading retailers are developing edge computing implementations to help shift microservices from the cloud to the edge. One early use case example is helping retailers [reduce latency and friction for online shoppers](/blog/developers/edgeworkers-use-story-creating-high-performing-individualized-campaign-responses) by shifting code from the cloud to the edge. And our IoT Edge Cloud team continues to develop an integrated messaging platform to reduce latency, improve decisioning, and manage costs in the burgeoning connected device ecosystem.\n\nIn the next two blog posts on this subject, we will dive into how economics helps dictate which data is best managed at the core, in the cloud, and at the edge, and then share a number of use cases that illustrate how the edge complements the cloud for latency, scalability, and security. \n\nStay tuned!\n\n  * [Edge](/blog?filter=blogs/edge)\n  * [Edge Compute](/blog?filter=solutions/edge-compute)\n  * [Trends](/blog?filter=blogs/trends)\n\n\n\nShare\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nDecember 08, 2020\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nAri Weil is the VP of Product Marketing at Akamai Technologies.\n\n## Related Blog Posts\n\n[ ![Together, edge networks and edge computing can significantly improve performance and benefit end users.](/site/en/images/blog/2024/thumbnails/edge-1080x608-1.png) Together, edge networks and edge computing can significantly improve performance and benefit end users. ](/blog/edge/everything-you-need-to-know-about-edge-networks)\n\n##  Everything You Need to Know About Edge Networks \n\nNovember 19, 2024\n\nLearn about the role of edge networks in IT infrastructure, including their components, benefits to IoT operations, and how they differ from edge computing.\n\nby Mike Elissen\n\n[Read more](/blog/edge/everything-you-need-to-know-about-edge-networks)\n\n[ ![You can leverage the right edge computing and 5G technologies to convert the largest user base possible.](/site/en/images/blog/2024/thumbnails/edge-1080x608-1.png) You can leverage the right edge computing and 5G technologies to convert the largest user base possible. ](/blog/edge/edge-computing-5g-emerging-technology-shaping-future-it)\n\n##  Edge Computing and 5G: Emerging Technology Shaping the Future of IT \n\nAugust 20, 2024\n\nLearn how and why enterprise businesses are using edge computing and 5G to deliver better digital experiences for their customers.\n\nby Santiago Giraldo\n\n[Read more](/blog/edge/edge-computing-5g-emerging-technology-shaping-future-it)\n\n[ ![Many enterprises are adopting an event-driven architecture for their approach to how microservices interact with one another.](/site/en/images/blog/2024/thumbnails/edge-1080x608-1.png) Many enterprises are adopting an event-driven architecture for their approach to how microservices interact with one another. ](/blog/edge/what-is-an-event-driven-microservices-architecture)\n\n##  What Is an Event-Driven Microservices Architecture?

Part 1: The Edge\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nOctober 19, 2020\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nAri Weil is the VP of Product Marketing at Akamai Technologies.\n\nShare\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/header-images/eng_header_image094.png)\n\nIf the title sounds like a trick question, it really depends on who you ask. Semantically, it seems clear that if you take the \"edge\" and combine it with \"computing\" you get edge computing. But if you have been reading headlines, you would be justified in having doubts that the answer is that simple. You may also still be asking the fundamental question, \"what is the edge, anyway?\" \n\nFor all of the excitement around these ideas, it is fascinating to see just how vaguely defined, and therefore overused, the terms are. To be fair, as the technology evolves, businesses are continuously discovering new use cases for how to leverage edge computing. This leads opportunistic marketers to co-opt the terms edge and edge computing, which then causes analysts and the media to repeatedly question whether the existing definitions still hold.\n\nAs a basic framing, the edge is a place, distributed away from the core of the data center. The purpose of the edge is to shift data and decisions closer to users and devices to deliver better user experiences. As Gartner VP analyst Bob Gill said in [The Edge Manifesto](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3104121/the-edge-manifesto-digital-business-rich-media-latency-s), the edge is designed \"for the placement of content, compute and data center resources on the edge of the network, closer to concentrations of users. This augmentation of the traditional centralized data center model ensures a better user experience demanded by digital business.\" \n\nLet's explore two of the prevailing platforms that claim to be at the edge: Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Akamai. The most logical definitions of the edge today speak about it as a place that's closest to users, devices, and data creation. As Akamai's CEO and co-founder Tom Leighton puts it: \"The edge is where all the users are. It's where all the devices are. And it's where all the bandwidth is -- that's why more and more functionality is moving to the edge.\" As of this writing, [AWS lists 217 points of presence](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/) while Akamai maintains over 4,100. \n\nThis highlights the difference between the architecture of the cloud versus that of the edge. The cloud is architected to create large, centralized installations that provide access to tools that help businesses build, deploy, and operate apps on that [cloud platform](/glossary/what-is-cloud-computing \"Cloud Computing Services\"). Cloud data centers are deployed in physical locations that are centralized by geographic location where there are large concentrations of businesses and users, with a focus on enabling availability and uptime for the applications developers build. \n\nThe edge is architected to create nimble, massively distributed installations that provide access to services that help businesses minimize latency, maximize scale, and provide a consistent security posture for apps deployed on any platform. Akamai's edge nodes are deployed in colocation facilities and embedded deep into carrier networks to maximize control over how content is delivered from the application to the user. \n\nThis is why Akamai maintains that the edge complements the cloud -- it surrounds and extends cloud infrastructure and applications, and creates a defensive shield around it, to improve the experience of users accessing the applications and content that businesses publish. Our goal has been to ensure that over 90% of the content and data that our customers' customers request is within one network hop of Akamai's edge. If we eliminate as many variables for delivering content to consumers (people or increasingly connected \"things\") as possible, we can ensure the best, most consistent experience and provide protection from an increasing number of security threats. \n\nCloud providers cannot truly provide edge capabilities unless they deploy their services to the edge. These providers have created incredibly sophisticated capabilities, but when they are centrally deployed, they are not truly edge services. It's why AWS is investing in what it calls [Local Zones](https://www.edgeir.com/aws-local-zone-goes-online-in-los-angeles-aws-enters-the-edge-goes-local-20200115) -- to provide true edge capabilities in local markets. A Local Zone is basically an edge data center. It resides outside the regions where AWS currently has availability zones, and is designed to bring localized infrastructure closer to end users that require very low levels of latency (in the single-digit milliseconds). As of this writing, AWS has [two Local Zones in Los Angeles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-a-second-local-zone-in-los-angeles/), one deployed in December 2019 and the other in August 2020. \n\nCloud providers will likely never expand to include a truly robust set of edge locations. The platforms were architected to provide access to [serverless compute](/solutions/edge/serverless-computing) capabilities via a centralized architecture, not a distributed one. Their business models are designed and optimized with availability and scalability in mind, versus low latency. And it takes a concerted effort over many years to develop the necessary relationships with thousands of local internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile network operators (MNOs) to create an edge network. Cloud providers may deploy some edge locations to satisfy specific use cases, but given the existence of an edge platform like Akamai that can already deliver low-latency computing and security solutions globally, the economics point to partnering, not building out competing systems. \n\nSo now that we have established the difference between the cloud and the edge, in upcoming posts we will dive into these concepts:\n\n  * What edge computing is, and how it differs from cloud computing\n\n  * Why economics dictate which data is best managed at the core, in the cloud, and on the edge\n\n  * How the edge complements the cloud for latency, scalability, and security use case\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned!\n\n  * [Cloud](/blog?filter=blogs/cloud)\n  * [Edge](/blog?filter=blogs/edge)\n  * [Trends](/blog?filter=blogs/trends)\n\n\n\nShare\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nOctober 19, 2020\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nAri Weil is the VP of Product Marketing at Akamai Technologies.\n\n## Related Blog Posts\n\n[ ![Together, edge networks and edge computing can significantly improve performance and benefit end users.](/site/en/images/blog/2024/thumbnails/edge-1080x608-1.png) Together, edge networks and edge computing can significantly improve performance and benefit end users. ](/blog/edge/everything-you-need-to-know-about-edge-networks)\n\n##  Everything You Need to Know About Edge Networks \n\nNovember 19, 2024\n\nLearn about the role of edge networks in IT infrastructure, including their components, benefits to IoT operations, and how they differ from edge computing.\n\nby Mike Elissen\n\n[Read more](/blog/edge/everything-you-need-to-know-about-edge-networks)\n\n[ ![You can leverage the right edge computing and 5G technologies to convert the largest user base possible.](/site/en/images/blog/2024/thumbnails/edge-1080x608-1.png) You can leverage the right edge computing and 5G technologies to convert the largest user base possible. ](/blog/edge/edge-computing-5g-emerging-technology-shaping-future-it)\n\n##  Edge Computing and 5G: Emerging Technology Shaping the Future of IT \n\nAugust 20, 2024\n\nLearn how and why enterprise businesses are using edge computing and 5G to deliver better digital experiences for their customers.\n\nby Santiago Giraldo\n\n[Read more](/blog/edge/edge-computing-5g-emerging-technology-shaping-future-it)\n\n[ ![Many enterprises are adopting an event-driven architecture for their approach to how microservices interact with one another.](/site/en/images/blog/2024/thumbnails/edge-1080x608-1.png) Many enterprises are adopting an event-driven architecture for their approach to how microservices interact with one another. ](/blog/edge/what-is-an-event-driven-microservices-architecture)\n\n##  What Is an Event-Driven Microservices Architecture?

That depends on what you're waiting for, of course. But in your daily interactions, think about how many \"things\" you interact with where you expect the response to be instantaneous -- tapping on mobile apps; logging in and transacting with a retailer or a bank; selecting and viewing content on a streaming media device; interacting with a connected device like a light, doorbell, or even a car; or checking in for a train or flight. These are all services that require real-time processing of information, at massive scale, and are examples of where edge computing can make the difference between a great experience and a really frustrating one by bringing processing closer to devices and data. \n\nEdge computing is not a new idea, just one that for decades was ahead of the market's ability to fully appreciate it. High-speed trading or optimizing and localizing services at branch offices are two long-standing examples of pushing business logic closer to where the action is. Modern technology adds use cases including enabling faster decisions for connected cars and other IoT devices or improving network processing speeds with 5G. \n\nAt the most basic level, edge computing brings data, insights, and decision-making closer to the things that act upon them. Rather than relying on a central location that can be thousands of miles away, the edge is as near to the \"thing\" as possible. The goal is ultimately a reliable, scalable implementation so that data, especially real-time data, does not suffer latency issues that can affect an application's purpose or performance. At Akamai, we have been operating an edge platform that delivers edge computing capabilities for over 20 years. The Akamai Intelligent Edge is broadly recognized as the largest distributed network platform and has been delivering edge computing solutions to our customers virtually from day one.\n\nIn the year 2000, centralized computing occurred in data centers, and Akamai implemented our first iteration of edge computing to battle the \"world wide wait.\" Our platform provided situational performance by assembling and delivering content based on business logic for each customer using a computing paradigm we called advanced metadata. Advanced metadata is an implementation of edge computing that uses XML to describe business logic for a given customer. \n\nIn 2001, we worked with other industry leaders to develop a standard edge computing implementation for developers called Edge Side Includes (ESi). ESi helped our customers scale, increase performance, and save money by moving fine-grained business logic that would have been done locally to our edge, reducing the amount of data that their infrastructure needed to process in a datacenter. Fast forward to today, and this capability is commonly called serverless computing, since the customer can abstract scaling business logic from scaling infrastructure.\n\nIn 2002, we pioneered the use of [Java and .NET technology at the edge](/security-research/the-state-of-the-internet) and started to use the term \"edge computing\" to describe our approach. As we worked with our customers to hone the value proposition for, and the utility provided by, edge computing, we realized that customers were not looking for raw performance from edge computing. Their goals were ultimately programmatic access to build out reliable, scalable and secure implementations of their business logic so that data, especially real-time data, did not suffer latency issues that can affect an application's purpose or performance. \n\nBy leveraging Akamai's Intelligent Edge as a programmable edge, they could maximize quality and reliability for their consumers, evaluate and optimize personalized web and mobile experiences, and maximize data autonomy and infrastructure and app security at a global scale. \n\nToday we have a myriad of edge computing solutions in use by customers across every major vertical. In fact, edge computing innovations represent approximately 20% of Akamai's more than 400 technology patents, and edge computing solutions generated well over $2 billion in revenue over the twelve months ended June 30, 2020. Those solutions can be grouped in three categories: content & media delivery, app & IoT optimization, and cloud & enterprise security. Here is a sample\n\n![Sample of categories](/site/en/images/blog/2020/08/EdgeComputingBlog_8.5-thumb-700xauto-10868.png)\n\nToday, we are witnessing a massive shift to a maker culture, and nearly all of our customers have infrastructure deployed in the cloud. Makers prefer to have fine-grained control over their compute deployments, which is why Akamai has been investing in open APIs and an API-first approach to development [since 2015](https://community.akamai.com/customers/s/article/Intro-to-the-Akamai-OPEN-APIs?language=en_US). In 2017, we introduced our [strategy to support the growing IoT edge computing ecosystem](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/akamai-unveils-strategy-to-support-customers-adopting-iot-300535559.html) which included extending our protocol support to include MQTT and implementing a publisher/subscriber model with an initial use case of connected vehicles. In 2019, we officially launched Akamai [IoT Edge Cloud](/newsroom/press-release/akamai-introduces-the-edge-cloud-solution-designed-to-scale-secure-and-simplify-iot-connected-device-and-in-application-messaging) to manage bi-directional messaging updates and deliver insights to endpoints and infrastructure, announced our partnership with MUFG to develop technology to power [blockchain ledger updates at the edge](/newsroom/press-release/akamai-and-mufg-announce-blockchain-based-payment-network), and opened up access to Akamai [EdgeWorkers](/products/serverless-computing-edgeworkers) to provide JavaScript-based business logic at the edge.\n\nThese edge computing solutions are complemented by tooling to [integrate Akamai-as-code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vc2zUKeD_RY&list=PLOHMCk97gHUGMgpN1PR3Cq5s7ZlCcMFmC) into any DevOps toolkit and CI/CD process, including the ability to deploy and test code to sandbox environments and align to automated software quality improvements with [global load testing and user session replay](/products/cloudtest) on our edge platform. There are hundreds of thousands of lines of code deployed on the Akamai Intelligent Edge to manage customer applications through these various implementations today, and that number continues to grow as our customers transform their digital businesses.\n\nToday Akamai interacts not just with content, but with objects, in order to help businesses realize unparalleled performance and security at scale. The intelligent edge has evolved to receive, store, and act upon objects in a way that is 100% protocol independent -- it works with HTTP, video streaming, and IoT applications. Our goal is to deliver the world's largest and most distributed programmable messaging fabric that makes Akamai part of the application as an evolution from our origins as part of the application delivery. We are excited to share this journey with you and look forward to seeing you at the edge!\n\n  * [Cloud](/blog?filter=blogs/cloud)\n  * [Edge Compute](/blog?filter=solutions/edge-compute)\n  * [Edge](/blog?filter=blogs/edge)\n\n\n\nShare\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nAugust 05, 2020\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nAri Weil is the VP of Product Marketing at Akamai Technologies.\n\n## Related Blog Posts\n\n[ ![Akamai's position as a Leader in the GigaOm Radar report is a testament to our innovative approach.](/site/en/images/blog/2024/thumbnails/edge-1080x608-1.png) Akamai's position as a Leader in the GigaOm Radar report is a testament to our innovative approach. ](/blog/news/akamai-leads-the-way-in-api-security-gigaom-radar)\n\n##  Akamai Leads the Way in API Security: GigaOm Radar for API Security Report \n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\nLearn why GigaOm named Akamai API Security a Leader and Fast Mover in the Innovation/Platform Play quadrant of the 2024 GigaOm Radar for API Security.\n\nby Stas Neyman\n\n[Read more](/blog/news/akamai-leads-the-way-in-api-security-gigaom-radar)\n\n[ ![Akamai’s strategic investments have focused on powering and protecting our customers’ ever-expanding infrastructure and application landscapes. ](/site/en/images/blog/2023/thumbnails/responsibility-to-our-customers.png) ](/blog/news/akamai-responsibility-to-our-enterprise-customers)\n\n##  Akamai’s Responsibility to Our Enterprise Customers \n\nDecember 21, 2023\n\nThe world’s best-known brands trust Akamai to reliably provide services and protect their reputation, availability, security, and customer experiences.\n\nby Adam Karon\n\n[Read more](/blog/news/akamai-responsibility-to-our-enterprise-customers)\n\n[ ![Connect with your peers and industry experts … at Akamai World Tour.](/site/en/images/blog/2023/thumbnails/akamai-world-tour-2023.png) ](/blog/news/akamai-world-tour-2023)\n\n##  Akamai World Tour 2023: Let’s Connect on Security and Cloud Innovation \n\nAugust 22, 2023\n\nJoin us on the Akamai World Tour 2023 to learn about the technologies that will be crucial to business success as applications continue to evolve.\n\nby Adam Karon and Mani Sundaram\n\n[Read more](/blog/news/akamai-world-tour-2023)\n\n### Products\n\n  * [ Cloud Computing  ](/solutions/cloud-computing)\n  * [ Security  ](/solutions/security)\n  * [ Content Delivery  ](/solutions/content-delivery-network)\n  * [ All products and trials  ](/products)\n  * [ Global Services  ](/global-services)\n\n\n\n### company\n\n  * [ About Us  ](/company)\n  * [ History  ](/company/company-history)\n  * [ Leadership  ](/company/leadership)\n  * [ Facts and Figures  ](/company/facts-figures)\n  * [ Awards  ](/company/our-awards)\n  * [ Board of Directors  ](/company/leadership/board-of-directors)\n  * [ Investor Relations  ](https://www.ir.akamai.com)\n  * [ Environmental, Social, and Governance  ](/company/corporate-responsibility)\n  * [ Ethics  ](/company/ethics-and-compliance)\n  * [ Locations  ](/company/locations)\n  * [ Vulnerability Reporting  ](/global-services/support/vulnerability-reporting)\n\n\n\n### Careers\n\n  * [ Careers  ](/careers)\n  * [ Working at Akamai  ](/careers/working-at-akamai)\n  * [ Students and Recent Grads  ](/careers/students-and-recent-graduates)\n  * [ Workplace Diversity  ](/careers/workplace-diversity)\n  * [ Search Jobs  ](https://akamaicareers.inflightcloud.com/search?searchable=%5B%5D&section=aka_ext)\n  * [ Culture Blog  ](/blog/culture)\n\n\n\n### newsroom\n\n  * [ Newsroom  ](/newsroom)\n  * [ Press Releases  ](/newsroom/press-release)\n  * [ In the News  ](/newsroom/in-the-news)\n  * [ Media Resources  ](/newsroom/media-resources)\n\n\n\n### Legal & compliance\n\n  * [ Legal  ](/legal)\n  * [ Information Security Compliance  ](/legal/compliance)\n  * [ Privacy Trust Center  ](/legal/compliance/privacy-trust-center)\n  * [ Cookie Settings  ](/legal/manage-cookie-preferences)\n  * [ EU Digital Services Act (DSA)  ](/legal/eu-digital-services-act)\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n\n  * [ What Is API Security?

He has over 15 years of experience in creating and marketing technology solutions for the enterprise market, including seven years at F5 Networks and a number of early-stage startups prior.\n\nShare\n\n![](/site/en/images/blog/header-images/eng_header_image162.png)\n\nFirst discovered in 1998, SQL injections remain an unsolved challenge and ongoing threat for every web application and API more than 20 years later. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) highlighted injection flaws in its Top 10 lists for both [web application security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and [API security threats](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/). For Akamai customers, SQL injections comprised 76% of all web application attacks detected over the past two years.\n\nSQL injections remain a challenge in 2020 for the same reasons that have driven the growth of the World Wide Web ([and Akamai with it](https://www.streamingmediablog.com/2020/08/akamai-milestone.html)) over the past two decades:\n\n  * There is more information online than ever before, including information that has financial value, and is therefore a target for attackers\n\n  * The number of web applications is rapidly growing, and Akamai customers often have hundreds of applications that collectively represent their digital experience\n\n  * Web applications have become highly complex, with many different components and technologies; the first-party and open source code in apps pose growing vulnerabilities, as do the many connections between services -- all of which can be exploited at any weak point\n\n  * Developers don't always think about security, and security teams aren't able to keep up with the increasing number of complex applications they're chartered to protect\n\n\n\n\nAll of these factors contribute to the challenges security teams face in keeping protection updated for constantly changing apps. But that's only half of the equation. Rapid iteration also creates a steady stream of possible new vulnerabilities and attack vectors designed to exploit them.\n\n### DDoS protection starts with zero-second mitigation\n\nMost customers start their [web application and API protection (WAAP)](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3903064/defining-cloud-web-application-and-api-protection-servic) journey with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) security. After all, applications need to be available before there's any worry about a data breach.\n\n![Large 809 Mpps Attack Mitigated by Akamai](/site/en/images/blog/2020/09/DDoSBlog1-thumb-700x505-10718-thumb-700x505-10952.jpg)\n\nFrom Operation Ababil to Memcached, the common thread between Akamai's DDoS security services has always been instant mitigation for attacks, backed by an industry-leading zero-second time-to-mitigate service-level agreement (SLA). Akamai designed its content delivery network (CDN) from the start as a reverse HTTP/S proxy that instantly drops all network-layer attacks, which make up the vast majority of all DDoS attacks. \n\nLikewise, our authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) service drops all traffic that is not on port 53 in zero seconds. [Prolexic Routed](/products/prolexic-solutions) introduced a similar capability in 2013, with proactive mitigation controls tailored to each customer's network profile. Prolexic Routed was also responsible for mitigating the record-setting 1.3 Tbps Memcached attack in February 2018 and [809 Mpps attack in June 2020](/blog/news/largest-ever-recorded-packet-per-secondbased-ddos-attack-mitigated-by-akamai).\n\nThe ability to mitigate even the largest attacks in zero seconds is unique in the industry. Starting with proactive mitigation provides the fastest and most effective method for mitigating the majority of DDoS attacks -- without any additional analysis required. This is especially critical with the DDoS landscape of 2020, where short \"hit and run\" and large-scale attacks comprising multiple attack vectors are increasing in prevalence. \n\nBoth of these trends increase the challenges of analyzing attack behavior and applying appropriate mitigation controls quickly. Defining and dropping abnormal traffic upfront provides a better experience for customers and allows Akamai's Security Operations Command Center (SOCC) staff to focus on attacks that require manual analysis and mitigation.\n\n## Demand more from your WAF\n\nWeb application attacks such as SQL injection pose very different challenges. How do you protect all of your web applications when a) you don't have enough application security staff or expertise and b) the applications themselves are constantly growing and changing? \n\nThe following principles have guided Akamai's web application firewall (WAF) development since 2009, when we introduced the industry's first edge WAF:\n\n  * Reduce the number of things that require management. Moving to an edge-based deployment model allows you to manage your global WAF configuration with a single interface, instead of having to configure dozens of appliances with every rule change.\n\n  * Look for anomalies, not Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). A CVE-based approach to WAF rules is unwieldy to manage and never gets ahead of the problem. Architecting the WAF around an anomaly scoring engine makes it easier to scale and has been proven effective against some zero-day vulnerabilities.\n\n  * Curate WAF rules for customers. The most recent Forrester Wave report on WAFs gave high marks to Akamai's internal threat intelligence. Most organizations don't have enough security resources to manage a WAF over time. Akamai threat researchers help by continuously updating and testing WAF rules against live traffic to make enablement easier for customers.\n\n  * Leverage machine learning where it makes sense. Most security teams won't trust an algorithm to update their WAF rules. Instead, Akamai uses machine learning to analyze live traffic (including 178 billion rule triggers a day) to identify anomalies requiring analysis by Akamai threat researchers.\n\n  * Automate as much as you can. Because of limited resources, most customers only protect their most critical applications, leaving many applications unprotected. Akamai developed [automated protections](/glossary/what-is-a-waf) to secure the rest of the application footprint with a one-time click.\n\n\n\n\nApply protection based on risk. A reputation-based approach is a common example of protection-based risk. However, it is more effective to go beyond a simple binary score to provide a more accurate risk assessment. This can be done by creating tailored risk scores based on attacker behavior against other customers and industries. In October, we'll be talking more about how to go beyond IP reputation and adapt WAF protections based on risk -- stay tuned.\n\n![Daily web application attacks](/site/en/images/blog/2020/09/waf_daily_attacks_2019-06-01_2020-05-31-thumb-700xauto-10954.jpg)\n\n## API security for agile organizations\n\n[API security](/solutions/edge) provides an industry-wide lesson on the need to provide a bridge between security teams and developers. Akamai introduced a positive security model for API protection in 2017, allowing customers to define API endpoints with Akamai to drop abnormal traffic and apply WAF inspection. However, this required security teams to have visibility into the APIs developers are creating, which has proven challenging for most organizations. To help bridge that gap, Akamai recommends that API security does the following:\n\n  * Automatically inspect all API traffic. Akamai now automatically inspects all XML and JSON traffic for web application attacks without requiring APIs to be defined and registered with Akamai.\n\n  * Automatically discover new API endpoints. In October, we'll be talking about an exciting new capability that will finally allow security teams to keep up with changing APIs by discovering API endpoints and their definitions -- integrated with WAF protections. Stay tuned and check our blog for updates.\n\n\n\n\n## Detecting 12 billion bot requests daily\n\nUnlike DDoS and web application attacks, where events can often be identified based on traffic volume or signature, bot attacks have always attempted to blend with human traffic to go undetected. In addition, the more sophisticated bot operators continuously evolve in their attempts to evade detections. \n\nThis has driven a major shift in how the industry has approached the problem. Akamai recommends the following practices:\n\n  * Leverage signature-based rules. Basic bot detection looks like a WAF, with rules based on bot signatures. These basic detections can still easily detect \"dumb bots\" comprising more than 50% of bot traffic, allowing advanced detections to focus on more sophisticated bots.\n\n  * Look for anomalies, not attacks. As bots continue to better mimic human behavior, identifying sophisticated bots requires dropping all preconceived notions of what a bot may look like. Instead, machine learning algorithms such as adaptive anomaly clustering look for anomalies in traffic and signals collected from the 1.3 billion devices that Akamai sees daily.\n\n  * Trust machine learning findings that review a lot of data. Detecting bots requires an algorithmic approach to correlating signals across different applications and customers in real time. However, machine learning requires lots of data to ensure accuracy. Akamai feeds signals from unmatched volumes of first-party data -- 1.3 billion unique clients per day and hundreds of Tbps of traffic -- into our machine learning algorithms to detect 12 billion bot requests and 280 million bot logins every day.\n\n  * Manage, don't mitigate. While bots may be easy to block, bot management remains a cat-and-mouse game between attackers and security vendors. Unlike traditional tools, Akamai's inline architecture provides a wide array of response options to help manage the long-term impacts of bots.\n\n\n\n\n## The newest frontier: in-browser threats\n\nMagecart-style attacks started hitting the mainstream in 2018, with major breaches at Ticketmaster, Newegg, and British Airways. These attacks are characterized by the ability to compromise scripts running on modern web pages. \n\nThese new types of attacks prove that new attack vectors will continue to be discovered as underlying applications continue to change. In response, security technology will continue to evolve as well. \n\nFor in-browser threats like Magecart, Akamai has shifted its approach again to:\n\n  * Protect in the browser, not in the application. Magecart-style attacks occur in every client's browser, invisible to traditional security tools. Detecting and mitigating compromised scripts running in the browser require implementing [protection](/products/client-side-protection-compliance) into the browser.\n\n  * Continuously monitor script behavior. Sophisticated script attacks can be executed in a fraction of a second and gone before you notice them. Akamai's unique approach continuously monitors script behavior, allowing you to catch even transient threats.\n\n  * Look for anomalies even in legitimate scripts. With malicious code injected into compromised scripts, in-browser threat protection must identify unusual changes in behavior even for well-known, legitimate scripts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom SQL injections to Magecart, the challenge of protecting web applications and APIs will continue to grow -- with new attack vectors to protect against as well as changing applications. Navigating the evolving threat landscape requires an expanding kit of tools, solutions, and vendors to reduce the risk of doing business online.\n\n## Beyond WAAP: enterprise and carrier security\n\nWhile often the most high-profile targets, data breaches are not limited to web applications. Gartner's secure access service edge (SASE) provides organizations with a broader framework through which to think through your security approach, including secure web gateway (SWG), Zero Trust Access, and [DNS security](/solutions/security). Your organization should evaluate its full needs and map to different approaches as well as potential solutions.

This ransom DDoS, or RDoS, threat was covered by Akamai's Security Intelligence Response Team (SIRT) in a [Security Alert](/blog/security/ransom-demands-return-new-ddos-extortion-threats-from-old-actors-targeting-finance-and-retail) released on August 17, 2020.\n\nAkamai's security alert highlights that we have seen an increase in attacks from organizations claiming to be the Armada Collective, Cozy Bear, Fancy Bear, and the Lazarus Group. Customers have reported receiving letters threatening attacks up to 2 Tb/sec. Thus far we have observed attacks ranging from 20 to 300 Gb/sec, and utilizing a variety of attack vectors. Specifically, the FBI has noted that observed attacks use User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Domain Name System (DNS), Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery), Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), Network Time Protocol (NTP), and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to generate attack traffic.\n\nMost recently, Akamai has seen an increasing number of extortion letters being sent to businesses in North America, APAC (Asia-Pacific), and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). While financial services was initially the most threatened vertical, letters have more recently targeted organizations in other industry verticals, including business services, high technology, hospitality, retail, and travel. A [recent ZDNet article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ddos-extortionists-target-nzx-moneygram-braintree-and-other-financial-services/) highlights the breadth of companies targeted as well as impacts to household names across these verticals.\n\nTo date, Akamai customers with active Prolexic DDoS mitigation controls have not experienced service disruptions as threatened by these threat actor groups. Akamai has mitigated over 50 attacks fitting this profile in recent weeks and will continue to work with our customers to implement 0-second SLA proactive mitigation controls, which are well matched towards combating the attack patterns we have observed. \n\nIf your business is threatened by RDoS, Akamai recommends not making ransom payments as there is no guarantee the attack will arrive or that the payment would prevent the DDoS attack. Instead, pull together your IT, operations, security, and customer communication staff to ensure you are prepared and know what to do in the event of an attack -- and if you require assistance, Akamai is standing by to help. \n\nWe offer an emergency security integration for rapid onboarding that can be initiated by using [Akamai's DDoS Hotline](/why-akamai/stop-cyberthreats) at +1 877-425-2624. Akamai will immediately take steps to triage the risk, apply the appropriate Akamai security tools, and walk through our attack incident procedures. Akamai has successfully performed emergency onboarding for tens of businesses in the past few days. In these instances, having network prefixes required for GRE Tunnels prepared in advance greatly reduces the time to onboard.\n\nExisting Akamai customers should either reach out to their account team or [contact Akamai Support](/global-services/support), and managed security services (MSS) customers should follow the existing processes they have established with Akamai's Security Operations Command Center (SOCC). Any customer that has been threatened will immediately be put on a High Alert status which results in the SOCC reviewing the situation and making preparations for an attack. Each customer's case will be tuned to meet the requirements of its business and applications.\n\nIt is worth noting that, while most of the threats Akamai has observed to date have been mitigated by our Prolexic DDoS mitigation service, best practices dictate that businesses put in place comprehensive [DDoS mitigations](/internet-station) at DNS and application layers as well. This includes reviewing your DNS solution and ideally ensuring you have a secondary DNS service in the event of an attack, as well as putting in place rate controls and deny rules in a web application firewall (WAF) to manage volumetric attacks. \n\n  * [Security](/blog?filter=blogs/security)\n  * [DDoS](/blog?filter=blogs/ddos)\n  * [Ransomware](/blog?filter=blogs/ransomware)\n\n\n\nShare\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nSeptember 11, 2020\n\n![Ari Weil](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/ari-weil.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Ari Weil](/blog?author=ari_weil)\n\nAri Weil is the VP of Product Marketing at Akamai Technologies.\n\n## Related Blog Posts\n\n[ ![The metaverse is more than an imaginative exercise for us; it’s the future — a future we should ideally start planning for now.](/site/en/images/blog/2022/thumnails/security-trends-to-address-now-on-our-way-to-the-metaverse.png) ](/blog/trends/security-trends-to-address-now-on-our-way-to-the-metaverse)\n\n##  Cybersecurity Issues in the Gaming Industry Portend Metaverse Challenges \n\nAugust 04, 2022\n\nThe metaverse has greatly expanded the threat landscape.

In an increasingly competitive business climate, organizations are fighting to maintain loyalty and keep users engaged online. The cost of switching is low, consumers are transient, and user expectations for how digital experiences should perform have never been higher.\n\nOnline performance is an integral part of the user experience (UX) -- an ongoing balancing act between design, functionality, and responsiveness that varies for every organization and industry. [Performance optimization](https://wpostats.com/) starts with a baseline assessment to understand which metrics matter most to your business, so you use the right measurements at the right time. \n\nIf you are not continuously optimizing, your website will get slower. According to an [internal study by Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJGCZCaIZkQ), 40% of brands regress on web performance after six months. Operating one of the world's largest edge networks, Akamai can help you deliver fast, personalized online experiences with best practices on how to manage, measure, improve, and maintain your website performance.\n\n### Assessing page weight\n\nUseful in the early stages of development, page weight metrics highlight the impact of rich content and scripts on download speed and browser execution time. These metrics are easy to communicate to web designers and developers, and often represent the low-hanging fruit of web optimization. Simple changes can yield significant performance boosts.\n\nThe [HTTP Archive Page Weight](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight) report, which tracks the size and quantity of many popular web page resources, can help you create a benchmarking guide. The following HTTP Archive table shows page weight percentile overall and by resource type (for example, the P50 percentile is the value below which 50% of the observations may be found) -- if one of these categories is unusually high, it typically means there is an opportunity for optimization:\n\n![Metrics chart](/site/en/images/blog/2020/09/MetricsBlog_9.3.20-thumb-700x250-10938.png)\n\nWhile these numbers do not tell you much about UX -- for example, two pages with the same number of requests or weight can render differently, depending on the order in which resources are requested -- they can act as a first check on web page performance. [LightWallet](https://web.dev/use-lighthouse-for-performance-budgets/) can keep track of the size and quantity of page resources based on your definition.\n\n### Establishing baseline metrics\n\nUsing synthetic testing, which replicates user actions under simulated conditions, you can establish a baseline for online performance by measuring response and load times as well as page assets and size. These user-centric performance metrics are typically conducted in a non-production environment to simulate the experience of loading a page. \n\nSynthetic testing simulates online performance for real users based on geographic location, connection, and device. These metrics establish testing standards, and can provide ongoing checks that alert you if performance thresholds are not being met. However, the periodic performance snapshots that synthetic monitoring provides are limited to the scripts, locations, and schedules you develop. You can't measure what you don't know. The only way to truly understand how your site performs for users is through real user monitoring (RUM).\n\n### Monitoring real users\n\nTo find the right level of performance for your websites and applications to meet your business goals, you need to define key performance indicator (KPI) measurements that assess user satisfaction. The challenge is that measuring the quality of UX is often site- and context-specific. For example, a page might be fast for one user on a 5G network, but slow for another user on a 2G network -- or appear to load quickly, but then respond slowly to user interaction. Synthetic testing measures your application, while RUM provides insight into real user experiences.\n\nWhen measuring performance, it is essential to be precise and refer to performance in terms of objective criteria that can be quantitatively measured. However, even an objective, quantitative measurement does not apply to all cases. For instance, a server could respond with a minimal page that appears to load immediately, but then defers fetching content and displaying anything on that page until several seconds after the load event fires. While this page technically has a fast load time, that figure does not reflect how a user actually experiences the page loading.\n\nRUM also identifies how first- and third-party scripts affect page load, UX, and business results. According to analysis by [thirdpartyweb.today](https://www.thirdpartyweb.today/), 57% of JavaScript execution time on the web is spent on third-party code. Data collected [across the top 4 million sites](https://github.com/patrickhulce/third-party-web) shows that advertising accounts for the largest chunk of third-party scripts, followed by hosting platforms and social. RUM helps you understand how these scripts impact user experiences and where you need to prioritize taking action based on your business and customer objectives.\n\n![Metrics chart](/site/en/images/blog/2020/09/MetricsBlog2_9.3.20-thumb-700xauto-10940.png)\n\n### Understanding UX\n\nThe [W3C Web Performance](https://www.w3.org/webperf/) Working Group is standardizing a set of metrics that more accurately measures how users experience the performance of a web page. There are several types of metrics that are relevant to how users perceive performance:\n\n  * Perceived load speed indicates how quickly a page can load and render all of its visual elements to the screen\n\n  * Load responsiveness reveals the rate at which a page can load and execute the required JavaScript, allowing the components to respond quickly to user interaction\n\n  * Runtime responsiveness shows, after page load, how fast the page can respond to user interaction\n\n\n\n\nThe diversity of indicators on UX demonstrates that no single metric is sufficient to capture all the performance characteristics of a page. As a starting point, here are some important measurements to include in your assessments:\n\n  * First contentful paint (FCP) measures the time from the start of the navigation until the first bit of content is rendered on the screen\n\n  * Largest contentful paint (LCP) measures the time from when the page starts loading to when the largest text block or image element is rendered on the screen\n\n  * Time to interactive (TTI) calculates the time from when the page starts loading to when it is fully interactive\n\n\n\n\nThese three metrics will provide a general understanding of the performance characteristics for most websites. They are also a good common set of metrics for you to compare performance against your competitors. However, there may be times when a specific website requires additional data to capture the full performance picture. For example, the LCP metric is intended to measure when the main content of a page has finished loading. But there are cases where the largest element is not part of the main content, and LCP does not apply.\n\nLet's look at a case where Akamai helped a customer optimize its digital business by providing visibility into UX to identify measurements that matter.\n\n### Customer case study: restaurant chain boosts digital business\n\nA large restaurant chain was looking for more visibility into website performance than its existing content delivery network (CDN) provider delivered. The chain's IT team was tired: tired of working weekends to keep applications up and running, tired of poor web performance adversely impacting the buying experience of loyal customers, and most importantly, tired of guessing at the causes of these issues without the tools to identify and fix them.\n\nTo show the restaurant chain the optimization opportunities it was missing, Akamai deployed mPulse RUM on the website. Approximately 10 days later, the front-end data collected was telling. The restaurant chain was missing out on revenue-generating opportunities due to downtime during peak periods, and mPulse data helped pinpoint sources such as:\n\n  * Cache settings not optimized with the existing CDN's out-of-the-box configuration\n\n  * Architecture passing traffic through the data center, versus being offloaded by the edge\n\n  * Back-end jobs creating denial of service (DoS) in the chain's own environment\n\n  * Suspicious bursts of traffic on the login page from bot attacks\n\n  * Heavy images causing poor performance and overage fees from the CDN provider\n\n\n\n\n![Metrics](/site/en/images/blog/2020/09/V5_Metrics%20That%20Matter%20Before-thumb-700xauto-10942.png)\n\nThis UX data made a strong case to switch to the Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform. After approximately a week, A/B testing showed that performance on the Akamai platform was better than the previous CDN across every metric. The chain added Akamai Image Manager into the mix to optimize page weight, and conversion numbers reached an all-time high. Page load speeds were noticeably faster, and there was no downtime after switching to Akamai.\n\n![Metrics](/site/en/images/blog/2020/09/V5_Metrics%20That%20Matter%20After-thumb-700xauto-10944.png)\n\nThen the COVID-19 crisis came, hitting the restaurant industry hard, and making digital services like online ordering critical for survival. When takeout became the primary business, the chain realized the best sales conversion day in its history -- the Akamai platform helped deliver flawless user experiences despite unprecedented online order volumes. In a two-week period, the restaurant chain's digital business increased from 13% to 26% of total revenue, and the chain attributed the stability of the online business to Akamai.\n\n### Never stop optimizing UX\n\nYour ability to assess page weight, establish baseline metrics, and monitor real users is key to understanding UX performance. The specific metrics to use? While there are some proven indicators of UX such as FCP, LCP, and TTI, it always depends on your business and goals.\n\nUsing an established framework on the quality of UX, such as [Google's HEART framework](https://library.gv.com/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product-5f46359ab5be), is a great way to identify the right metrics for your business. You should assess a mixture of objective measures, such as conversion rate, sales, and registrations, as well as subjective measures such as recommendations and ratings. Along with capturing what happened, it is imperative that you also capture why -- knowing about a dip in user satisfaction over the past 30 days is important, but knowing why it dropped is even more important. RUM can provide you with this insight, as can open-text questions and an ongoing dialogue with users.\n\nFinally, you should be striving for positive business outcomes, not just healthy UX performance metrics. Always look to improve the UX for your websites and applications, but only if the optimizations support your business goals by keeping customers happy and coming back.\n\n  * [Performance](/blog?filter=blogs/performance)\n  * [Analytics](/blog?filter=blogs/analytics)\n  * [Delivery](/blog?filter=blogs/delivery)\n\n\n\nShare\n\n![Stephen Stierer headshot](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/userpic-757-100x100.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Stephen Stierer](/blog?author=stephen_stierer)\n\nSeptember 02, 2020\n\n![Stephen Stierer headshot](/site/en/images/blog/userpics/userpic-757-100x100.png)\n\nWritten by\n\n[Stephen Stierer](/blog?author=stephen_stierer)\n\nStephen Stierer is a Pre-sales leader with 15+ years of experience and a passion for Web Performance.\n\n## Related Blog Posts\n\n[ ![At Akamai, we meet customers’ needs by providing a total solution that covers all the bases.](/site/en/images/blog/2024/thumbnails/edge-1080x608-1.png) At Akamai, we meet customers’ needs by providing a total solution that covers all the bases. ](/blog/performance/look-beyond-vendors-sales-claims)\n\n##  Too Good To Be True?
