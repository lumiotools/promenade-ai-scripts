          "content": "AMERICA’S CAR-MART REPORTS FIRST QUARTER\nFISCAL YEAR 2025 RESULTS\nRogers, AR, September 4, 2024 – America’s Car-Mart, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRMT) (“we,” “Car-Mart” or\nthe “Company”), today reported financial results for the first quarter ended July 31, 2024.\nFirst Quarter Key Highlights (FY’25 Q1 vs. FY’24 Q1, unless otherwise noted)\n• Revenue was $347.8 million, down 5.2%\n• Interest income increased $4.1 million, up 7.2%\n• Total collections increased 4.3% to $172.9 million\n• Gross Margin increased 30 bps to 35.0%\n• Favorable adjustment to allowance for credit loss to 25.0%, down from 25.32%\n• Net charge-offs as a % of average finance receivables were 6.4% vs. 5.8%\n• Interest expense increased $4.0 million, or 28.3%\n• Loss per share of $0.15 vs. diluted earnings per share of $0.63\nPresident and CEO Doug Campbell commentary:\n“I’m encouraged with our rebound in sales volume from two quarters ago, despite the ongoing\neconomic challenges facing the customer today. During the quarter, our new loan origination\nsystem (“LOS”) contributed to higher down payments and improved deal structures. I’d like to\nrecognize our operations team for improvements on several credit metrics. Affordability remains\nCar-Mart’s number one focus in putting and keeping customers on the road. We believe that our\nstrategic priorities, including acquisitions like Texas Auto Center completed in June, will\nstrengthen our competitive position and along with cost control initiatives, can drive better results\nfor the remainder of the fiscal year.”\nFirst Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Key Operating Metrics\nDollars in thousands, except per share data.

A portion of the decline in revenue was offset by increases in interest income and average\nretail sales price. We had a sequential reduction in the average retail sales price, excluding\nancillary products, of approximately $100. Our initiatives in place should allow us to see this\nfavorability continue throughout the balance of the calendar year.\nSALES – Sales for the quarter were 14,391 units vs. 15,912 units, down 9.6%. This is the second\nquarter of sequential improvement in unit sales on a year-on-year basis.\nGROSS PROFIT – Gross profit margin as a percentage of sales was 35%, or $6,996 per unit, an\nimprovement of 30 basis points, or $228 per unit. This 3.4% increase resulted from continued\nexecution and focus on gross margin.\nNET CHARGE-OFFS – Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were\n6.4% compared to 5.8%. On a relative basis, we experienced continued increases in both the\nfrequency and severity of losses, primarily from FY 22 and FY 23 originations. This is evident\nwhen looking at our cash-on-cash returns table contained here. As a reference, the quarterly\nperformance of net charge-offs for the five-year period preceding the pandemic period ranged\nfrom 5.9% - 8.7%, signaling a return to more normal pre-pandemic levels.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES – The allowance for credit loss as a percentage of finance\nreceivables, net of deferred revenue and pending accident protection plan claims, decreased from\n25.32% at April 30, 2024, to 25.0% at July 31, 2024 providing a 32 basis points benefit to the\nprovision for credit losses. The primary driver of this favorability are originations from our new\nLOS and their favorable performance when compared to originations from the legacy underwriting\nsystem. As of July 31, 2024, approximately 40% of the outstanding portfolio balance originated\nfrom LOS. Delinquencies (accounts over 30 days past due) improved by 90 basis points to 3.5%\nof finance receivables as of July 31, 2024, but increased sequentially by 40 basis points from\n3.1% of finance receivables as of April 30, 2024. This put us ending the quarter with recency, the\naverage percentage of receivables current, at 82.3%. This is higher than any quarter within the\nlast two fiscal years.\nUNDERWRITING – Average down payments improved to 5.2%, 20 basis points over the prior\nyear first quarter. The average originating term was 44.3 months, down from the prior year’s 44.7\nmonths, despite a 2.4% higher average sales price. These improved deal structures are expected\nto strengthen the performance of the portfolio going forward. The projected cash-on-cash returns\nfor the quarter improved to 72.4%, a 290-basis points improvement over originations in the prior\nquarter. Please see the table and supplemental material for Cash-on-Cash returns.\nSG&A EXPENSE – SG&A expense was $46.7 million compared to $46.5 million. Although we\nhad favorable declines in payroll and payroll-related costs from prior expense management\nactions, expenses supporting recently implemented technology offset this favorability. When\nlooking at SG&A per customer, it was $453 compared to $444 the prior year. This 2% increase\nis also driven by our most recent acquisitions who are currently building a book of customers. We\nexpect this dynamic to improve in subsequent quarters and ultimately provide SG&A leverage.\nLEVERAGE & LIQUIDITY – Debt to finance receivables and debt, net of cash, to finance\nreceivables (non-GAAP)1 were 53.4% and 46.7%, compared to 49.3% and 42.9%, respectively,\nat the end of the prior year’s first quarter (sequentially 52.6% and 46.0%, respectively). During\nthe first quarter, we grew finance receivables by $29.9 million, increased inventory by $7.1 million,\ninvested $13.6 million in dealership acquisitions, and purchased fixed assets of $986,000, with a\n$23.7 million increase in debt, net of cash.\nANNUAL CASH-ON-CASH RETURNS – We continue to generate solid cash-on-cash returns.\nDuring the quarter, the frequency of losses on originations in fiscal years 2021 through 2023 were\nhigher than prior projections; however, these contracts represent a smaller balance of our total\nportfolio. In contrast, the originations generated during fiscal year 2024 improved cash-on-cash\nreturns by 140 basis points, mainly due to lower than projected loss rates. Fiscal year 2025 is off\nto a solid start with projected returns of 72.4% due to the improved underwriting.\nThe following table sets forth the actual and projected cash-on-cash returns as of July 31, 2024,\nfor the Company’s finance receivables by origination year. The return percentages provided for\ncontracts originated in fiscal years 2017 through 2020 reflect the Company’s actual cash-on-cash\nreturns.\n2\nCash-on-Cash Returns\nLoan Origination Prior Quarter Current Quarter % of A/R\nYear Projected Actual/Projected Variance Remaining\nFY2017 * 61.1% * 0.0%\nFY2018 * 67.6% * 0.0%\nFY2019 * 70.0% * 0.1%\nFY2020 * 73.6% * 0.2%\nFY2021 72.8% 72.5% -0.3% 2.2%\nFY2022 56.6% 54.9% -1.7% 11.7%\nFY2023 52.5% 49.1% -3.4% 28.9%\nFY2024 62.9% 64.4% 1.4% 62.8%\nFY2025 * 72.4% * 96.8%\n* 2017 - 2020 Pools' Current Projection reflects actual cash-on-cash returns\n1 Calculation of this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in\nthe tables accompanying this release\n2“Cash-on-cash returns” represent the return on cash invested by the Company in the vehicle finance loans the Company originates\nand is calculated with respect to a pool of loans (or finance receivables) by dividing total “cash in” less “cash out” by total “cash out”\nwith respect to such pool. “Cash in” represents the total cash the Company expects to collect on the pool of finance receivables,\nincluding credit losses. This includes down-payments, principal and interest collected (including special and seasonal payments)\nand the fair market value of repossessed vehicles, if applicable. “Cash out” includes purchase price paid by the Company to acquire\nthe vehicle (including reconditioning and transportation costs), and all other post-sale expenses as well as expenses related to our\nancillary products. The calculation assumes estimates on expected credit losses net of fair market value of repossessed vehicles\nand the related timing of such losses as well as post sales repair expenses and special payments. The Company evaluates and\nupdates expected credit losses quarterly. The credit quality of each pool is monitored and compared to prior and initial forecasts\nand is reflected in our on-going internal cash-on-cash projections.\nKey Operating Results\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023 % Change\nOperating Data:\nRetail units sold 14,391 15,912 (9.6) %\nAverage number of stores in operation 155 155 -\nAverage retail units sold per store per month 30.9 34.2 (9.6)\nAverage retail sales price $ 19,250 $ 18,799 2.4\nTotal gross profit per retail unit sold $ 6,996 $ 6,768 3.4\nTotal gross profit percentage 35.0% 34.7%\nSame store revenue growth (8.6)% 8.2%\nNet charge-offs as a percent of average finance receivables 6.4% 5.8%\nTotal collected (principal, interest and late fees) $ 172,872 $ 165,747 4.3\nAverage total collected per active customer per month $ 562 $ 535 5.0\nAverage percentage of finance receivables-current (excl. 1-2 day) 82.3% 80.5%\nAverage down-payment percentage 5.2% 5.0%\nPeriod End Data:\nStores open 156 154 1.3 %\nAccounts over 30 days past due 3.5% 4.4%\nActive customer count 103,231 104,734 (1.4)\nPrincipal balance of finance receivables $ 1,465,259 $ 1,440,707 1.7\nWeighted average total contract term 48.1 46.9 2.5\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly results on Wednesday,\nSeptember 4, 2024, at 9 am ET.

          "content": "2024 Annual Report\n\nDouglas W. Campbell\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmerica’s Car-Mart\n07-03-24\nDear Shareholders,\nI am honored to address you for the first time as the Chief Executive Officer of America’s\nCar-Mart. As we navigate through a challenging period in the automotive and finance sectors, I\nam filled with optimism and have confidence in the strategies put in place for this fiscal year.\nThe persistent inflationary environment of thepast year tested our industry, this company,\nand especially strained the finances of our customers and consumers who lack access to credit and\nhomeownership. These pressures were especiallyevident in the second quarter,when credit losses\npeaked. As a company, we were faced with several key operational decisions. Against this\nindustry backdrop of rising delinquency and default rates we elected to tighten our lending\nstandards rather than roll struggling customers into new loans with even longer terms. Wekept as\nmany of our existing customers in their cars, while prospectively originating loans to customers\nbased on new, tighter credit standards. These twin duties demanded both large-scale change\nmanagement and wide-spread adoption. We took this direction notwithstanding the certain impact\non unit sales: our volumes bottomed out in the third quarter. We recovered a portion of the lost\nsales in the fourth quarter as volumes improved sequentially by 30%, from 11,664 units to 15,251\nunits. Despite the sequential improvement, our efforts still left a volume shortfall of 13.6% versus\nthe prior year’s fourth quarter - the best sales period in the company’s history. As I look back and\nreflect, I believe emphasizing prudent underwriting, given the current environment and cost of\ncapital, was the correct decision.\nDespite these challenges, Car-Mart completed the rollout of several technology projects\nyears in the making. Our associates demonstrated remarkable agility and commitment, navigating\nthis environment while maintaining our market position as one of the country’s largest used car\nretailers.\nOur impact on the communities we serve is paramount, and last year America’s Car-Mart\nwas recognized for several achievements:\nSubprime Auto Finance News 2024 Honoree for our work in special finance\nStevie Award for our outstanding work within communities\nNewsweek’s award for America’s Greatest Workplaces\nNamed to AR500’s most influential companies for the third consecutive year\nSeveral employees with individual achievement awards\nNewsweek’s award for Most Trusted Companies\nThis recognition is testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees, the trust\nof our customers, and the support of our shareholders and directors. Looking ahead, several key\ninitiatives will drive our success and strengthen our position in the market:\n1. Leveraging New Technology: We are committed to providing an unparalleled customer\nand associate experience by leveraging digital technologies, including our new Enterprise\nResource Planning (“ERP”) and Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”) systems\nrolled out shortly after the close of the fiscal year. Our new ERP system replaces the aging\ntechnology which both capped ourgrowth and required anabundance of manual processes.\nOur new system is versatile, provides critical capacity for future growth, the ability to\nreimagine workflows throughout our finance organization, and a reduction of back-office\nwork processes in our stores. The CRM system is store-facing and will enable us to more\nquickly and efficiently respond to consumers who apply for credit. Collectively, in fiscal\n2024 we received more than 250,000 applications across different channels. We have a\nresponsibility to help prospective customers who reach out for assistance. Even more\nimportantly, we need to manage their experience thoughtfully, whether or not we can help\nthem buy a car today. These applications represent tens of thousands of sales opportunities\nand the potential to lower customer acquisition cost.\n2. Improved Affordability: I believe this to be the largest challenge for our industry today.\nThe largest drivers behind our losses are the escalating prices of food, auto insurance,\nhousing, and childcare. These costs are reflected in the average overall income levels\nobserved on credit applications. While the most important factors vary regionally across\nthe country, there is a general consensus that average vehicle selling prices need to be 8-\n10% lower by the end of the fiscal year to stem the affordability crisis. We’ve put in place\nseveral initiatives inthe vehicle value chain to lower our vehicle acquisition costs. These\ninitiatives include optimized agreements with both vehicle repair shops and transportation\ncompanies. Further, our procurement teams are diligently streamlining the number of\nvendors we utilize, providing a higher volume of vehicles at a reduced cost. These efforts\nhave been underway for a year and aided in a 120-basis point increase in gross profit\nmargin. The success of our affordability initiatives will be reflected in gross margin\nimprovement over the coming years.\n3. Loan Origination System: One of our most significant advancements is the\nimplementation of a new loan origination system. This modernized platform leverages\nadvanced analytics to assess credit risk more accurately and efficiently. The automated,\ndata-driven approach increases our sales capacity by shortening the approval and sales\nprocess while enabling well-informed lending decisions. We have implemented tighter\ncontrols at the local, area, regional, and enterprise levels; we were previously limited to\nvarying controls solely at the enterprise level. This system has made us more agile, and\nwe plan to add new functions such as a more predictive scorecard and risk-based pricing,\nallowing us to offer competitive loanterms while minimizing the risk of defaults. We will\nalso gain enhanced insights into the preferences and behaviors of customers who do not\ncomplete a purchase, enabling us to make more informed decisions and better address their\nneeds in the future. The loan origination system has already shown promising results,\nreducing both the frequency and severity of defaults, amounting to a 20% reduction in\ncredit losses relative to the losses incurred on static pools originated by our legacy system.\nSharper, faster, more flexible underwriting enhances our ability to provide financing to a\nbroader range of customers and maintain strong financial health. Projected cash-on-cash\nreturns from loans originated in the fourth quarter of 2024are nearly 70%. We are focused\non utilizing the system to intelligently win back volume. In June, we welcomed a new\nHead of Credit and Risk to accelerate knowledge of the system with the singular aim of\ngrowing the portfolioprofitably.\n4. Cox Automotive Inc. (CAI) Strategic Partnership: We started our partnership with CAI\nduring the fourth quarter of 2024. CAI is the world's largest automotive services and\ntechnology providerwith solutions for car shoppers, automakers, dealers, retailers, lenders,\nand fleet owners. The initial structure of the partnership involves logistics, vehicle repair,\nand procurement solutions. This partnership will aid in increasing speed to market, provide\nboth additional insight into and lower cost of vehicle repairs, and a flexible solution to\nvehicle procurement providing incremental low-cost vehicles. This partnership will scale\nthroughout the fiscal year, and we anticipate its benefits to impact our business broadly,\nfrom improving gross margin and lowering administrative expenses to enhancing data and\nanalytics. This expansion both aligns with growing consumer demand for affordable\ntransportation solutions and positions us as a forward-thinking leader in the industry.\n5. Prudent Capital Allocation: As we continue to navigate an evolving retail landscape, it\nis critical that we remain nimble and strategic in our approach to business operations.\nDuring the last fiscal year, we undertook a comprehensive review of our store portfolio to\nensure that each location aligns with our long-term objectives and contributes positively to\nour financial health. This analysis led us to the difficult decision to close certain\nunderperforming stores, three of which were completed last year. We do not take this\ndecision lightly, as we understand the impact it has on our employees, customers, and\ncommunities. However, it is a necessary step to enhance our overall performance and\nposition our company for sustainable growth given the current cost of capital.\nConsolidating our resources and focusing on successful locations improves operational\nefficiency and strengthens our market presence. This strategic realignment will allow us to invest\nin areas that offer the greatest potential for organic growth, includingthe management of consumer\nleads, vehicle cost and quality, and other innovative product offerings. We are also improving our\nsystem by taking capital from underperforming stores and redeploying it in the acquisition of\nhighly productive dealerships. This strategy allows us to optimize our geographic footprint, gain\naccess to new markets, and benefit from economies of scale. We have a pipeline of opportunities\nunder evaluation and expect this to be part of our ongoing strategy for growth.\nThe sum of these changes is greater value for our shareholders, enabling us to better serve\nour customers and communities while enhancing our competitive position. Thank you for your\ncontinued trust and support as we work towards a stronger and more prosperous future for our\ncompany. We are fully dedicated to delivering sustainable growth and long-term value. Our team\nis passionate, and we have a renewed sense of purpose with regard to taking on new challenges\nand seizing opportunities: trouble is opportunity.\nI am grateful for your continued support and confidence in America’s Car-Mart. Together,\nwe will navigate the dynamic landscape and I look forward to sharing our progress and celebrating\nour achievements with you in the coming months. Thank you for your trust and partnership.\n\nExecutive Officers\nFrom left to right: Doug Campbell, President Vickie Judy, Chief\nFinancial Officer\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)\n(State or other jurisdiction of incorporation or organization) (IRS Employer Identification No)\n(Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code)\n(Registrant’s telephone number, including area code)\nSecurities registered pursuant to Section12(b)of the Act:\nTitle of each class Trading Symbol(s) Name of each exchange on which registered\nCommon Stock, par value $0.01 per share CRMT NASDAQ Global Select Market\nSecurities registered pursuant to section12(g)of the Act:\nIndicate by check mark if the registrant is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule405 of the Securities Act.Yes No\nIndicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file reports pursuant to Section13 or Section15(d)of the Act.Yes No\nIndicate by check mark whether the registrant (1)has filed all reports required to be filed by Section13 or 15(d)of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934 during the preceding 12months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to file such reports), and (2)has been subject to such\nfiling requirements for the past 90days.Yes No\nIndicate by check mark whether the registrant has submitted electronically every Interactive Data File required to be submitted pursuant to Rule 405 of\nRegulation S-T during the preceding 12 months (or for such shorter period that the registrant was required to submit such files).

You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation initially formed in 1981 (the “Company”), is one of the\nlargest publicly held automotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the “Integrated Auto Sales\nand Finance” segment of the used car market. References to the “Company” include the Company’s consolidated\nsubsidiaries.The Company’s operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries, America’s\nCar Mart, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (“Car-Mart of Arkansas”), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas\ncorporation (“Colonial”). Collectively, Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial are referred to herein as “Car-Mart.”\nThe Company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers.\nManyoftheCompany’s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing\nas a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems. As of April 30, 2024, the Company operated 154\ndealershipslocated primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States.\nIn general, it is the Company’s objective to continue to expand its businessusing the same business model\nthat has been developed and used by Car-Mart for over 40 years with enhancements to our technology and core\nproducts to better serve our customers. This business strategy focuses on:\nCollecting customer accounts is perhaps the single most important aspect\nof operating an Integrated Auto Sales and Finance used car business and is a focal point for dealership level and\ncorporate office personnel on a daily basis. The Company measures and monitors the collection results of its\ndealerships using internally developed delinquency and account loss standards. A large part of dealership\nmanagement and account representatives’incentive compensation is tied directly or indirectly to collection results.\nThe Company has a collections department and support staffat the corporate levelto work with field operators to\nimprovecollectionresults. This team monitorsefficiencies and the effectiveness ofaccount representatives as they\nwork to improve customer success rates. The Company also utilizes several collection efforts centrally at the\ncorporate office through texting, phone calls and other methods to supplement the field efforts. Over the last five\nfiscal years, the Company’s annual provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged from a low of\n19.31% in fiscal 2021 to 36.48% in fiscal 2024 (average of 26.36%). During fiscal 2024, credit losses signaled a\nreturn to more normal pre-pandemic levels, but customers are still faced with continued inflationary pressure and\nincreasing interest rates from federal monetary policy. The percentage of credit loss as a percentage of sales was\nimpacted by the lower sales revenue in fiscal 2024. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion.\nThe Company’s dealerships operate on a decentralized basis.\nEach dealership is ultimately responsible for the quality of its vehicles, making sales contacts, making credit\n5\ndecisionswith our loan origination system,and collecting the contractsit originates in accordance with established\npolicies and procedures. Approximately 50% ofcustomers make their payments in person at one of the Company’s\ndealerships. This decentralized structure is complemented by the oversight and involvement of corporate office\nmanagement and the maintenance of centralized financial controls, including monitoring proprietary creditscoring,\nestablishing standards for down-payments and contract terms, and an internal compliance function.\nThe Company grows by\nincreasing revenues at existing dealerships and openingor acquiringnew dealerships. The Company has historically\nviewedorganic growth at its existing dealerships as its primary source for growth. The Company continues to make\ninfrastructure investments in order to improve performance of existing dealerships and to support growth of its\ncustomer count. The Company acquired onenew dealership duringthe yearendingfiscal 2024 with 154 locations.\nThe Company intends to continue to add new dealerships primarily through the pursuit of strategic acquisition\nopportunities that it believes will enhance its brand and maximize the return to its shareholders. The Company has\nsuccessfully completedacquisitions in eachof the last three fiscal yearsand anticipates thatfutureacquisitions will\nlikely contribute to its growth. These plansare subject to change based on both internal and external factors.\nThe Company focuseson selling basic and affordable transportation to its\ncustomers. The Company’s average retail sales price was $19,113per unit in fiscal 2024, compared to $18,080 in\nfiscal 2023. Used vehicle pricing continued to increase due to the high demand and tight supply of used vehicles.\nIn general, the demand for quality, used vehicles has increased due toashortage of new vehicles leading to inventory\nconstraints in both the new and used vehicle markets. Management expects continued pressure on the supply and\nprice of used vehicles for the near term. The Company focuses on providing a quality vehicle with affordable\npayment terms while maintaining relatively shorter-term lengths compared to others in the industry on its\ninstallment sales contracts (overall portfolio weighted average of 47.9 months).\n. As of April 30, 2024, approximately 71% of the Company’s\ndealerships were located in cities with populations of 50,000 or less. The Company believes that by operating in\nsmaller communities it develops strong personal relationships, resulting in better collection results. Further, the\nCompany believes that operating costs, such as salaries, rent and advertising, are lower in smaller communities than\nin major metropolitan areas. As the Company builds its infrastructure and certain aspects of the business become\nmore centralized, we may expand and operate in larger cities.\nThe Company seeks to hire honest and hardworking\nindividuals to fill entry-level positions, nurture and develop these associates, and promote them to managerial\npositions from within the Company.By promoting from within, the Company believes it is able to train its associates\nin the Car-Mart way of doing business, maintain the Company’s unique culture and develop the loyalty of its\nassociates by providing opportunities for advancement. Due to growth, the Company has, to a larger extent, also\nhad to look outside of the Companyfor associates possessing requisite skills and core competencies and who share\nthe values and appreciate the unique culture the Company has developed over the years. The Company has also\nbeen able to attract quality individuals via its Training and Development Team and Recruiting Team.Management\nhas determined that it will be increasingly difficult to grow the Company without looking for outside talent. The\nCompany’s operating success has been a benefit for recruiting outside talent; however, the Company expects the\nhiring environment to continue to be challenging as a result of increasing wages, competition for qualified workers,\nand the impact of inflation on our business and operations.\nThe Company believes that developing and maintaining a\nrelationship with its customers is critical to the success of the Company. A large percentage of sales at mature\ndealerships are made to repeat customers, and additional sales result from customer referrals. By developing a\npersonal relationship with its customers, the Company believes it is in a better position to assist a customer, and the\ncustomer is more likely to cooperate with the Company should the customer experience financial difficulty during\nthe term of his or her installment contract.The Company is able to cultivate these relationships through a variety of\ncommunication channels, including our recently developed customer relationship management technology and\n6\ndirect face-to-face interactions as a high percentage of customers visit Company dealerships in-person to make\npayments and for account and vehicle servicing needs.\nThe Company believes it possesses a number of strengths or advantages that distinguish it from most of its\ncompetitors. These business strengths include:\nThe Company has a strong senior management team with\nextensive experience in the automotive industry and expertise in understanding the unique needs and preferences\nof subprime customers.The Company’s managementteamis driven tocontinuously innovate and adapt to changing\nmarket dynamics, embrace technology, explore new avenues for growth andmake a positive impact on customers’\nlives. This extensive industry experience and strong motivation, coupled with strategic decision-making,\noperational efficiency, and customer focus, enable the Company to tailor its operations to best serve its customers\nand help drive valuefor the Company and solidify its position in theused car market.\nThe Company’s operations are highly structured. While dealerships operate\non a decentralized basis, the Company has established policies, procedures, and business practices for virtually\nevery aspect of a dealership’s operations. Detailed online operating manuals are available to assist the dealership\nmanager and office, sales and collections personnel in performing their daily tasks. As a result, each dealershipis\noperated in a uniform manner. Further, corporate office personnel monitor the dealerships’ operations through\nweekly visits and a number of daily, weekly and monthly communications and reports.\nThe Company has structured its dealership and corporate office operations to\nminimize operating costs.The number of associates employed at the dealershiplevel is dictated by the number of\nactive customer accounts each dealership services. Associate compensation is standardized for each dealership\nposition and adjusted for various markets.Other operating costs are closely monitored and scrutinized. Technology\nis utilized to maximize efficiency. Our recent technology investments in a new loan origination system and an\nenterprise resource planning system have beenfoundational in improving efficiencies and operational flexibility as\nthe Company grows.The Company monitors operating costs as a percentage of revenuesandper customer served\nand strives to provide excellent service at a low cost.\nThe Company believes itcan fundits planned growth from net income generated from\noperations supplemented by its external capital resources.Tothe extent external capital isneeded to fund growth,\nthe Company plans to draw on its existing credit facilities, or renewals or replacements of those facilities, and to\nparticipate in the securitization market from time to time, when appropriate. The Company may also choose to\naccess other debt or equity markets if needed or if market conditions are favorable to pursue its growth and\nacquisition strategies.Management will continue to scrutinize capital deployment to manage appropriate liquidity\nand access to capital to support growth. As of April 30, 2024, the Company’s ratio of debt to finance receivables\n(revolving credit facilities and non-recourse notes payable divided by principal balance of finance receivables) was\n52.6%. Excluding the amount of total cash, the Company’s adjusted ratio of debt to finance receivables (a non-\nGAAP measure) as of April 30, 2024was 46.0% whichthe Company believes is lower than many of its competitors.\nFor a reconciliation of the adjusteddebtto finance receivablesratioto the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” included in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Company historically targets smaller communities in which\nto locate its dealerships (i.e., populations from 20,000 to 50,000), but has operationsin larger cities such as Tulsa,\nOklahoma; Lexington, Kentucky; Springfield, Missouri; Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee and Little Rock,\nArkansas. The Company believes there are numerous suitable communitiesto expand our physical footprint within\nthe twelve states in which the Company currently operates and other contiguous states to satisfy anticipated\ndealership growth for the next several years. In addition, the Company is leveraging its growing online presence,\n7\nincluding an intuitive website, online inventory browsing, and seamless online application process, to improve the\nbuying experience while also reaching beyond physical dealership locations.\nEach dealership is an operating segment with its results regularly reviewed by the\nCompany’s Head of Operations in an effort to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and\nto assess its performance. Individual dealerships meet the aggregation criteria for reporting purposes under the\ncurrent accounting guidance. The Company operates in the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance segment of the used\ncar market.In this industry, the nature of the sale and the financing of the transaction, financing processes, the type\nof customer and the methods used to distribute the Company’s products and services, including the actual servicing\nof the contracts as well as the regulatory environment in which the Company operates, all have similar\ncharacteristics.Each dealership is similar in nature and only engages in the selling and financing of used vehicles.\nAll individual dealerships have similar operating characteristics. As such, individual dealerships have been\naggregated into one reportable segment.\nDealershipsoperate on a decentralized basis.Each dealershipis responsible for\nselling vehicles, making credit decisions, and servicing and collecting the installment contracts it originates, with\nassistance from the corporate office. Dealership-level financial statements are prepared by the corporate office on\na monthly basis and reviewed by various levels of management. Depending on the number of active customer\naccounts, a dealership may have as few as four or as many as thirty-eight full-time associates employed at that\nlocation. Associate positions at a large dealership may include a general manager, assistant manager(s), office\nmanager, office clerk(s), service manager, purchasing agent, collections personnel, sales personnel, inventory\nassociates (detailers), and on-call drivers.Dealershipsare generally open Monday through Saturday from 9:00 a.m.\nto 6:00 p.m.\nBelow is a summary of dealershipsoperatingduring the fiscal years\nended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended April 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nDealerships at beginning of year 156 154 151\nDealerships opened or acquired 1 3 3\nDealerships closed (3) (1) -\nDealerships at end of year 154 156 154\n8\nBelow is a summary of dealershiplocations by state as of April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nAs of April 30,\nDealerships by State 2024 2023 2022\nArkansas 37 37 38\nOklahoma 29 30 30\nMissouri 18 18 18\nAlabama 16 16 16\nTexas 14 14 13\nKentucky 12 12 12\nGeorgia 9 9 9\nTennessee 9 10 8\nMississippi 5 5 5\nIllinois 3 3 3\nIndiana 1 1 1\nIowa 1 1 1\nTotal 154 156 154\nDealershipsare located on leased or owned property between one and four acres in size.When opening a\nnew dealership, the Company will either remodel an existing structure on the property to conduct business or\nconstruct a new facility.Dealershipfacilities typically range in size from 1,500 to 5,000 square feet.\nThe Company purchases vehicles primarily from wholesalers, new car dealers, rental/fleet\ncompanies, auctions and the general public. Vehicle purchasing is performed by corporate buyers as well as\npurchasing agents in our local communities. Dealership managers are authorized to purchase vehicles as needed.\nThe Company centrallysets purchasing guidelines andmonitorsthe quantity and quality of vehicles purchased and\nholds responsible parties accountable for results.When purchasing inventory, focus is given tothree general areas:\n• Compliance with Company standards, including an internal condition report;\n• Costs and physical characteristics of the vehicle, based on market values; and\n• Vehicle reliability and historical performance, based on market conditions.\nGenerally, the Company purchases vehicles between 5 and 12 years of age with 70,000 to 150,000 miles\nand pays between $7,000 and $15,000 per vehiclewith an averagecostof $7,300 per vehicle. The Company focuses\non providing basic transportation to its customers. The Company sells a variety of vehicles that include primarily\nsport utility vehicles, trucks, and sedans. The Company typically does not purchase sports cars or luxury cars. A\nmember of dealership management inspects and test-drives vehicles prior to a sale.The Companystrives to purchase\nvehicles that require little or no repair as the Company has limited facilities to repair or recondition vehicles. As\npart of the strategy to obtain quality, affordable vehicles, the Company has formed relationships with reconditioning\ncompanies leveraging volumes to negotiate improved labor rates and consistent condition reports to recondition\nvehicles, in particular repossessions and trades, in order to have access to a larger quantity of and lower cost\nvehicles.\nDealerships generally maintain an inventory of 20 to 90 vehicles\ndepending on the size and maturity of the dealership and also the time of the year. Inventory turns over\napproximately 7 times each year. Selling is done predominantly by the dealership manager, assistant manager,\nmanager trainee or sales associate.Sales associates are paid a commission for sales in addition to an hourly wage.\nSales are made on an “as is” basis; however, customers are given an option to purchase a service contract, which\ncovers certain vehicle components and assemblies. For covered components and assemblies, the Company\ncoordinates service with third-party service centers with which the Company typically has previously negotiated\nlabor rates.The vast majority of the Company’s customers elect to purchase a service contract when purchasing a\nvehicle. Additionally, the Company offers its customers to whom financing is extended an accident protectionplan\n9\n(“APP”)product. The APPproduct contractually obligates the Company to cancel the remaining amount owed on\na contractwhere the vehiclehas been totaled, as definedin the plan, or the vehicle has been stolen. APPis available\nin most of the states in which the Company operates, and the vast majority of financed customers elect to purchase\nthis product when purchasing a vehicle in those states.\nThe Company has a 7-day vehicle exchange policy. If a customer is not satisfied with their purchase, the\ncustomer has the option to returnthe vehicle within 7 days after purchasing the vehicle or before having driven the\ncar for 500 miles (whichever occurs first), and the Company will exchange it for another vehicle of equal or lesser\nvalue.\nThe Company’s objective is to offer its customers basic transportation at a fair price and treat each customer\nin such a manner as to earn his or her repeat business.The Company attempts to build a positive reputation in each\ncommunity where it operates and generate new business from such reputation as well as from customer referrals.\nFor mature dealerships, a large percentage of sales are to repeat customers.\nThe Company primarily advertises using television, radio, digital and social media. In addition, the\nCompany periodically conducts promotional sales campaigns in an effort to increase sales or promote the brand.\nThe Company uses an outside marketing firm to enhance its brand strategy and broaden the Company’s usage of\ndigital and social media channels.\nThe Company provides financing to substantially all of its customers who\npurchase a vehicle at one of its dealerships. The Company only provides financing to its customers for the purchase\nof its vehicles and selected ancillary products, and the Company does not provide any type of financing to non-\ncustomers. The Company’s installment sales contracts as of April 30, 2024, typically include down payments\nranging from 0% to 20% (average of 5.4%),terms ranging from 18months to 69months (average of 47.9 months),\nand a fixed annual interestrate of18.25%for contracts originating after early December 2023(up from 18.0%) for\nall states except Arkansas, Illinois and acquired dealerships in Tennessee. The interest rate for sales in Arkansas,\nwhich account for approximately 27.1% of the Company’s revenues, is subject to a usury cap of 17%,and therefore,\nthese sales are originated at 16.75%. The interest rate for sales in Illinois and the acquired Tennessee dealerships\nrange from 19.5% to 23.0%. The portfolio weighted average interestrate is 16.9%.\nThe Company requires that payments be made on a weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis,\nscheduledto coincide with the day the customer is paid by his or her employer, with approximately 78% of payments\nbeing due on either a weekly or bi-weekly basis. Upon the customer and the Company reaching a preliminary\nagreement as to financing terms, the Company obtains a credit application from the customer which includes\ninformation regarding employment, residence and credit history and personal references. These items are entered\ninto the origination system and then certain information is verified by Company personnel. After the verification\nprocess, the dealership manager makes the decision to accept, reject or modify (perhaps obtain a greater down\npayment orsuggest a lower priced vehicle) the proposed transaction.The refinements to the underwriting guidelines\nin the origination system improved the dealership manager’s ability to assess the stability and character of the\napplicant. The dealership manager who makes the credit decision is ultimately responsible for collecting the\ncontract, and his or her compensation is directly related to the collection results of his or her dealership. The\nCompany provides centralized support to the dealership manager by assisting in underwriting decisions when\nneeded, as well as providing training and reporting used for monitoring customer accounts on a daily, weekly and\nmonthly basis.\nAll of the Company’s retail installment contracts are serviced by Company personnel at the\ndealershiplevel.Approximately halfof the Company’s customers make their payments in person at the dealership\nwhere they purchased their vehicle; however, in an effort to make paying convenient for its customers, the Company\noffers a variety of payment options. Customers can send their payments through the mail, set up ACH auto draft,\nmake mobile and online payments, and make payments at certain money service centers. Each dealership closely\nmonitors its customer accounts using the Company’s proprietary receivables and collections software that stratifies\npast due accounts by the number of days past due. The vice presidents of operations and the area operations\n10\nmanagers routinely review and monitor the status of customer collections to ensure collection activities are\nconducted in compliance with applicable policies and procedures.The Company believes that the timely response\nto past due accounts is critical to its collections success.\nThe Company has established standards with respect to the percentage of accounts one and two weeks past\ndue, 15 or more days past due and 30 or more days past due (delinquency standards), and the percentage of accounts\nwhere the vehicle was repossessed, or the account was charged off that month (account loss standard).\nThe Company works diligently to keep its delinquency percentages low and not to repossess vehicles.\nAccounts one to three days late are contacted by telephone or text message. Notes from each contact are\nelectronically maintained in the Company’s computer system. The Company centrally utilizes text messaging\nnotifications which allows customers to elect to receive payment reminders and late notices via text message.\nThe Company attempts to resolve payment delinquencies amicably prior to repossessing a vehicle. If a\ncustomer becomes severely delinquent in his or her payments, and management determines that timely collection\nof future payments is not probable, the Company will take steps to repossess the vehicle.Periodically, the Company\nenters into contract modifications with its customers to extend or modify the payment terms. The Company only\nenters into a contract modification or extension if it believes such action will increase the amount of monies the\nCompany will ultimately realize on the customer’s account and will increase the likelihood of the customer being\nable to pay off the vehicle contract. At the time of modification, the Company expects to collect amounts due\nincluding accrued interest at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay. No other concessions are granted\nto customers, beyond the extension of additional time at the time of modification. Modifications are minor and are\nmade for pay day changes, minor vehicle repairs and other reasons. For those vehicles that are repossessed, a large\nportion are returned or surrendered by the customer on a voluntary basis. Other repossessions are performed by\nCompany personnel or third-party repossession agents. Depending on the condition of a repossessed vehicle, it is\neither resold on a retail basis through a Company dealershipor sold for cash on a wholesale basis,primarily through\nphysical or online auctions.\nAlong with strategic dealership acquisitions, the Company continues to\nexplore opportunities for new dealership openings. When opening new dealerships, senior management, with the\nassistance of the corporate office staff, will make decisions with respect to the communities in which to locate a\nnew dealershipand the specific sites within those communities.New dealerships have historically been located in\nthe general proximity of existing dealerships to facilitate the corporate office’s oversight of the Company’s\ndealerships.\nSince 2020,the Company has actively pursued strategic dealership acquisitions\nto expand its market presence and enhance its business operations. Most recently, the Company continued its\nexpansion efforts by acquiring used car dealerships in Tennessee, Texas and Arkansas. These acquisitions helped\nthe Company further strengthen its footprint and increase its market share. By strategically acquiring established\ndealerships, the Companybelieves it can accelerate its growth and solidify its position as a key player in the used\nauto industry. TheCompany’s recentacquisitions have not only expanded the Company's geographic reach but also\nallowed the Company to leverage the acquired dealerships' operational efficiencies, experienced personnel, and\ncustomer relationships, leading to enhanced value for both the Companyand its customers.Management continues\nto actively pursue additional acquisitions, including in regions beyond the Company’s existing geographic footprint,\nand believes that disruptions in the current competitive landscape will provide unique opportunities to acquire\nproductive dealerships in good markets managed by experienced owners and their staff.\nThe corporate office, based in Rogers, Arkansas, consists\nof regional vice presidents of operations, area operations managers, as well as regional support personnel in\ninventory, sales, collections, compliance and human resources. The corporate office also provides training and\ndevelopment personnel, accounting and management information systems personnel, compliance and risk\npersonnel, administrative personnel and senior management.The corporate office monitors and oversees dealership\noperations. The corporate office has access to operating and financial information and reports on each dealership\n11\non a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annualbasis.This information includes cash receipts and disbursements,\ninventory and receivables levelsand statistics, receivables aging,sales and account loss data.The corporate office\nuses this information to compile Company-wide reports, plan dealership visits and prepare monthly financial\nstatements.\nPeriodically, area operations managers, regional vice presidents, compliance auditors, loss prevention\nassociates,and senior management visit the Company’s dealerships to inspect, review and comment on operations.\nThe corporate office provides the overall training plan and assists in training new managers and other dealership\nlevel associates. Compliance auditors and loss prevention associates visit dealerships to ensure policies and\nprocedures are being followed and that the Company’s assets are being safe-guarded. In addition to financial results,\nthe corporate office uses delinquency and account loss standards and a point system to evaluate a dealership’s\nperformance. Also, bankrupt and legal action accounts and other accounts that have been written off at dealerships\nare handled by the corporate office to allow dealership personnel time to focus on more current accounts.\nThe Company’s dealershipmanagers meet monthly on an area, regional or Company-wide basis.At these\nmeetings, corporate office personnel provide training and recognize the achievements of dealershipmanagers.Near\nthe end of every fiscal year, the respective area operations manager, regional vice president and senior management\nconduct “projection” meetings with each dealership manager. At these meetings, the year’s results are reviewed and\nranked relative to other dealerships, and both quantitative and qualitative goals are established for the upcoming\nyear. The qualitative goals may focus on staff development, effective delegation,and leadership and organization\nskills. Quantitatively, the Company establishes unit sales goals and profit goals based on invested capital and,\ndepending on the circumstances, may establish delinquency, account loss or expense goals.\nThe corporate office is also responsible for establishing policy, maintaining the Company’s management\ninformation systems, conducting compliance audits, orchestrating new dealershipopenings and setting the strategic\ndirection for the Company.\nThe market for used car sales in the United States is significant. Used car retail sales\ntypically occur through franchised new car dealerships that sell used cars or independent used car dealerships. The\nCompany operates in the Integrated Auto Sales and Financesegment of the independent used car sales and finance\nmarket.Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers sell,and finance used cars to individuals that often have limited\ncredit histories or past credit problems. Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers typically offer their customers\ncertain advantages over more traditional financing sources, such as less restrictive underwriting guidelines, flexible\npayment terms (including scheduling payments on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to coincide with a customer’s\npayday), and the ability to make payments in person, an important feature to individuals who may not have a\ncheckingaccount.\nThe used automobile financing industry is served by traditional lending sources such\nas banks, savings and loans, and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, as well as by independent\nfinance companies and Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers.Many loans that flow through the more traditional\nsources have historically ended up packaged in the securitization markets. Despite significant opportunities, many\nof the traditional lending sources have not historically been consistent in providing financing to individuals with\nlimited credit histories or past credit problems.Management believes traditional lenders have historically avoided\nthis market because of its high credit risk and the associated collections efforts. Beginning in 2012, funding for the\ndeep subprime automobile market increased significantly and has remained elevated compared to historic levels,\nlikely due to the ultra-low interest rate environment combined with the historical credit performance of the used\nautomobile financing market during and after the recession of the prior decade.However, as a result of the recent\ninflationary environment,increased funding costs,and increased insurance costs,credit availability for used vehicle\nfinancing has tightened. Management expects this to continue for the foreseeable future and believes the reduced\navailabilityof used vehicle financing willprovide the Company an opportunity to gain market share and better serve\nan increasing customer base.\n12\nThe used automotive retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive. The Company competes\nprincipally with other independent Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers, as well as with (i) the used vehicle\nretail operations of franchised automobile dealerships, (ii) independent used vehicle dealers, and (iii) individuals\nwho sell used vehicles in private transactions. The Company competes for both the purchase and resale of used\nvehicles. The tight supply of used vehicles in our market has led to higher purchase and retail prices which have\nbeen the primary contributors to the Company’s decision in recent periods to allow longer term lengths and slightly\nlower down payments in connection with our customer financing contracts.\nManagement believes the principal competitive factors in the sale of its used vehicles include (i) the\navailability of financing to consumers with limited credit histories or past credit problems, (ii) the breadth and\nquality of vehicle selection, (iii) pricing, (iv) the convenience of a dealership’s location, (v) the option to purchase\na service contract and an accident protection plan, and (vi) customer service. Management believes that its\ndealerships arenot only competitive in each of these areas, but have some distinct advantages, specifically related\nto the provision of strong customer service for a credit challenged consumer. The Company’s local face-to-face\npresence combined with some centralized support through digital and phone allows it to serve customers at a higher\nlevel by forming strong personal relationships.\nHistorically, the Company’s third fiscal quarter (November through January) has been the slowest period\nfor vehicle sales. Conversely, the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters (May through July and February\nthrough April) have historicallybeenthe busiest times for vehicle sales. Therefore, the Companygenerally realizes\na higher proportion of its revenue and operating profit during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. The Company\nexpects this pattern to continue in future years.\nIf conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or fourth fiscal quarters, the adverse effect on\nthe Company’s revenues and operating results for the year could be disproportionately large.\nThe Company is committed to a culture of compliance by promoting and supporting efforts to design,\nimplement, manage, and maintain compliance initiatives. The Company’s operations are subject to various federal,\nstate and local laws, ordinances and regulations pertaining to the sale and financing of vehicles. Under various state\nlaws, the Company’s dealerships must obtain a license in order to operate or relocate. These laws also regulate\nadvertising and sales practices. The Company’s financing activities are subject to federal laws such as truth-in-\nlending and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws,\ninstallment finance laws, usury laws and other installment sales laws. Among other things, these laws require that\nthe Company limit or prescribe terms of the contracts it originates, require specified disclosures to customers,\nrestrict collections practices, limit the Company’s right to repossess and sell collateral, and prohibit discrimination\nagainstcustomers on the basis of certain characteristics including age, race, gender and marital status.\nThe Company’s consumer financing and collection activities are also subject to oversight by the federal\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which has broad regulatory powers over consumer credit\nproducts and services such as those offered by the Company. Under applicableCFPB rules, the Company’s finance\nsubsidiary, Colonial, is deemed a “larger participant” in the automobile financing market and is therefore subject to\nexamination and supervision by the CFPB.\nThe states in which the Company operates impose limits on interest rates the Company can charge on its\ninstallment contracts. These limits have generally been based on either (i) a specified margin above the federal\nprimary credit rate, (ii) the age of the vehicle, or (iii) a fixed rate.\n13\nThe Company is also subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations that pertain to the\nenvironment, including compliance with regulations concerning the use, handling and disposal of hazardous\nsubstances and wastes.\nManagement believes the Company is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal,\nstate and local laws, ordinances and regulations; however, the adoption of additional laws, changes in the\ninterpretation of existing laws, or the Company’s entrance into jurisdictions with more stringent regulatory\nrequirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s used vehicle sales and finance business.\nAt America’s Car-Mart, Inc., our associates are the heart of our business. Our associates are committed to\nmaking a difference for customers, their communities and each other. As of April 30, 2024, the Company, including\nits consolidated subsidiaries, employed a diverse associate base of approximately 2,280 fulltime associates. None\nof the Company’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company believes that its\nrelations with its employees are positive.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe Company’s culture is one that fosters diversity, equity and inclusion. We view diversity as an important\nfactor in reflecting the values and cultures of all our associates. Each of our dealerships is a locally operated\nbusiness, and our diversity must represent the communities in which we serve. The Company is an equal opportunity\nemployer that strives to provide an inclusive environment, including associates that represent a wide range of\nbackgrounds, cultures, and experiences. The Company’s hiring practices are designed to find and promote\ncandidates reflecting the various communities in which we operate. As of April 30, 2024, 53% of the Company’s\nassociates were women and 33% of our associates were racially or ethnically diverse.\nEmployee Safety and Health\nEnsuring the safety of all associates is a critical priority for the Company. Associates are expected to stay\ninformed about safety initiatives and to report unsafe conditions to their supervisor. Suppliers are expected to ensure\nthat employees working on behalf of Car-Mart adhere to all of the Company’s health and safety policies,\nrequirements and regulations. The Company’s specific annual safety goals are to eliminate all preventable work-\nrelated injuries, illnesses and property damage and achieve 100% compliance with all established safety procedures.\nInternally, we track workplace injuries among associates, customers and other third parties at our facilities. With\nour comprehensive safety and education program and attention to proper procedures at our dealerships, the number\nof incidents is below industry standards for all retail locations. Our Legal and Compliance departments are\nresponsible for safety education and training, and regularly reviews indicators and areas where risks and injuries\ncan occur, helping to eliminate hazards. General Managers at each dealership are responsible for safety at their\nlocation on a daily basis, and members of the safety committee at our corporate office are trained on CPR and other\nemergency procedures and regularly conduct drills for events such as a fire or tornado.\nFrom a health perspective, the Company believes it is important to support the physical, mental, social,\nenvironmental and financial well-being of our Car-Mart associates at work and at home. The Company is committed\nto doing so with key initiatives that inspire associates to strive for long-term sustainable health and wellness for\nthemselves and their families. We seek to educate and empower associates to improve and maintain their overall\nhealth. Further, we offer resources for preventive care, such as flu shots, vaccinations and other preventative health\nscreenings. Associates have access to retirement investment plans and legal consultants to help them save for their\nfuture needs. The Company also offers professional resources that promote associates’ mental health and general\nwell-being at no cost to the associates and their immediate families.\n14\nTalent and Development\nThe Company is committed to building a working environment and culture that attracts, develops and\nretains motivatedassociates. The Company strives to provide associates with broader challenging opportunities, an\nenvironment that encourages entrepreneurial thinking and the ability to develop their career. The success of our\ngrowth strategy and the operation of an organization that supports dealerships throughout 12 states requires that we\ncontinue to seek, attract, hire and retain top talent at all levels of the Company. We offer a competitive compensation\nand benefits program, and an opportunity for our associates to grow personally and professionally, with an eye\ntoward retirement and financial planning.\nThe Company provides each associate with a comprehensive compensation package that is based on the\nrole he or she fills. Our compensation philosophy is based on performance, both individually and as a company.\nMany of our associates have the opportunity toearn additional compensation through commissions, performance-\nbased salary increases and bonuses. All associates earn above minimum wage requirements under both state and\nfederal law requirements. In addition, associates have a menu of benefit options to choose from to meet their needs.\nThe Company offers multiple programs for associate training, mentoring, and advancement. All associates\nare required to complete orientation courses in culture, safety, sexual harassment and discrimination awareness, and\nother compliance topics. Associatesalso have access to online training programs for the development of job-specific\nskills, leadership behaviors, and advanced topics such as unconscious bias. The Company’s Future Manager\ntraining program allows associates to learn all facets of operating a Car-Mart store from vehicle inventory and\nfacility management to effective collection techniques, while acquiring leadership skills. In addition, the Company\nmaintains its “Car-Mart U” training program which builds on the foundation established in the Future Manager\nprogram by providing a series of blended learning solutions preparing assistant managers for a general manager or\nother elevated management role by introducing new curriculum focused on advanced leadership training, business\nconcepts and customer experience. We believe such programs demonstrate the Company’s commitment to the long-\nterm growth, motivation, and success of our associates.\nThe Company’s website is located at www.car-mart.com.

The following is a discussion of risks that could materially and\nadversely affect the Company’s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRecent and future disruptions in domestic and global economic and market conditions could have adverse\nconsequences for the used automotive retail industry in the future and may have greater consequences for the non-\nprime segment of the industry.\nIn the normal course of business, the used automotive retail industry is subject to changes in regional U.S.\neconomic conditions, including, but not limited to, interest rates, gasoline prices, inflation, personal discretionary\nspending levels, and consumer sentiment about the economy in general.Recent and future disruptions in domestic\nand global economic and market conditions, including rising interest rates and higher grocery and gasolineprices,\nor significant changes in the political environment (such as the ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East, and\nUkraine) and/or public policy,could adversely affect consumer demand or increase the Company’s costs, resulting\nin lower profitability for the Company. Due to the Company’s focus on non-prime customers, its actual rate of\ndelinquencies, repossessions and credit losses on contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than\nthose experienced in the automotive retail finance industry in general.\nThe outlook for the U.S. economy and the impacts of efforts to reduce inflation through interest rate\nincreases remains uncertain, which may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations\nand liquidity. Periods of economic slowdown or recession are often characterized by high unemployment and\ndiminished availability of credit, generally resulting in increases in delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and credit\nlosses. Further, periods of economic slowdown may also be accompanied by temporary or prolonged decreased\nconsumer demand for motor vehicles and declining used vehicle prices. Significant increases in the inventory of\nused vehicles during periods of economic slowdown or recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed\nautomobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales. The prices of used vehicles are variable and a rise or\ndecline in the used vehicle prices may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company is unable\nto predict with certainty the future impact of the most recent global and domestic economic conditions on consumer\ndemand in our markets or on the Company’s costs.\nA reduction in the availability or access to sources of inventory could adversely affect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the costs of vehicles purchased.\nThe Companyacquires vehicles primarily through wholesalers, new car dealers, individuals and auctions.\nThere can be no assurance that sufficient inventory will continue to be available to the Company or will be available\nat comparable costs. Any reduction in the availability of inventory or increases in the cost of vehicles could\nadversely affect gross marginpercentages as the Company focuses on keeping payments affordable to its customer\nbase. The Company could have to absorb a portion of cost increases. The supply of vehicles at appropriate prices\navailable to the Company is significantly affected by overall new car sales volumes, which were negatively\nimpacted by the business and economic and supply chain disruptions following the outbreak of the COVID-19\npandemic and have historically been materially and adversely affected by prior economic downturns. Any future\ndecline in new car sales could further adversely affect the Company’s access to and costs of inventory. Our ability\nto source vehicles could also be impacted by the closure of auctions and wholesalers as a result of any future public\nhealth crisis, adverse economic conditions,or other factors.\n17\nThe used automotive retailindustry is fragmented andhighly competitive, which could result in increased costs to\nthe Company for vehicles and adverse price competition.Increased competition on the financing side of the business\ncould result in increased credit losses.\nThe Company competes principally with other independent Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers, and\nwith (i) the used vehicle retail operations of franchised automobile dealerships, (ii) independent used vehicle\ndealers, and (iii) individuals who sell used vehicles in private transactions. The Company competes for both the\npurchase and resale, which includes, in most cases, financing for the customer, of used vehicles. The Company’s\ncompetitors may sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that Car-Mart offers in the same or similar markets at\ncompetitive prices. Increased competition in the market, including new entrants to the market, could result in\nincreased wholesale costs for used vehicles and lower-than-expected vehicle sales and margins. Further, if any of\nthe Company’scompetitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for used vehicles, the Company\nwould likely reduce its prices in order to remain competitive, which may result in a decrease in its sales and\nprofitability and require a change in its operating strategies. Increased competition on the financing side puts\npressure on contract structures and increases the risk for higher credit losses. More qualified applicants have more\nfinancing options on the front-end, and if events adversely affecting the borrower occur after the sale,the increased\ncompetition may tempt the borrower to default on their contract with the Company in favor of other financing\noptions, which in turn increases the likelihood of the Company not being able to save that account.\nThe used automotive retail industry operates in a highly regulated environment with significant attendant\ncompliance costs and penalties for non-compliance.\nThe used automotive retail industry is subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and\nregulations, such as local licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising, vehicle sales, financing, and\nemployment practices. Facilities and operations are also subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations\nrelating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The violation of these laws and regulations could\nresult in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties against the Company or in a cease and desist order.As a result,\nthe Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures, and other costs of\ncomplying with these laws and regulations. Further, over the past several years, private plaintiffs and federal, state,\nand local regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny of advertising, sales and finance\nactivities in the sale of motor vehicles. Additionally, the Company’s finance subsidiary, Colonial, is deemed a\n“larger participant” in the automobile finance market andistherefore subject to examination and supervision by the\nCFPB, which has broad regulatory powers over consumer credit products and services such as those offered by the\nCompany.\nThe Company’s business is geographically concentrated; therefore, the Company’s results of operations may be\nadversely affected by unfavorable conditions in its local markets.\nThe Company’s performance is subject to local economic, competitive, and other conditions prevailing in\nthe twelve states where the Company operates. The Company provides financing in connection with the sale of\nsubstantially all of its vehicles. These sales are made primarily to customers residing in Alabama, Arkansas,\nGeorgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas with approximately 27.1% of\nrevenues resulting from sales to Arkansas customers. The Company’s current results of operations depend\nsubstantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these local markets. Any decline in\nthe general economic conditions or decreased consumer spending in these markets may have a negative effect on\nthe Company’s results of operations.\nThe Company’s growth strategy is dependent upon the following factors:\nFavorable operating performance. Our ability to increase revenues at existing dealerships or expand our\nbusiness through additional dealership openings or strategic acquisitions is dependent on a sufficiently\nfavorable level of operating performance to support the management, personnel and capital resources\nnecessary to successfully grow existing locations, open and operate new locations,or acquire new locations.\n18\nAbility to successfully identify, complete and integrate new acquisitions.Part of our current growth strategy\nincludes strategic acquisitions of dealerships. We could have difficulty identifying attractive target\ndealerships, completing the acquisition or integrating the acquired business’ assets, personnel and\noperations with our own. Acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without\nlimitation, the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations; potential disruption of our\nongoing business and distraction of our management or the management of the target company; difficulties\nin maintaining controls, procedures and policies; potential impairment of relationships with associates and\npartners as a result of any integration of new personnel; potential inability to manage an increased number\nof locations and associates; failure to realize expected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings;reaction to\nthe transaction among the companies’ customers and potential customers; andthe effect of any government\nregulations which relate to the businesses acquired.\nAvailability of suitable dealership sites.Our ability to open new dealerships is subject to the availability of\nsuitable dealership sites in locations and on terms favorable to the Company. If and when the Company\ndecides to open new dealerships, the inability to acquire suitable real estate, either through lease or\npurchase, at favorable terms could limit the expansion of the Company’s dealership base.In addition, if a\nnew dealership is unsuccessful and we are forced to close the dealership, we could incur additional costs if\nwe are unable to dispose of the property in a timely manner or on terms favorable to the Company. Any of\nthese circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s expansion strategy and future\noperating results.\nAbility to attract and retain management for new and existing dealerships.The success of new dealerships\nis dependent upon the Company being able to hire and retain additional competent personnel. The market\nfor qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which the Company operates is highly\ncompetitive. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified and competent personnel to operate our new\ndealerships, these dealerships may not be profitable, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfuture financial condition and operating results.\nAvailability and cost of vehicles. The cost and availability of sources of inventory could affect the\nCompany’s ability to open new dealerships. The long-term impacts of the economic downturn due to\nCOVID-19 on new car sales volumes and the ability of auctions and wholesalers to continue to operate is\nuncertain. Any of these factors could potentially have a significant negative effect on the supply of vehicles\nat appropriate prices available to the Company in future periods. This could also make it difficult for the\nCompany to supply appropriate levels of inventory for an increasing number of dealerships without\nsignificant additional costs, which could limit our future sales or reduce future profit margins if we are\nrequired to incur substantially higher costs to maintain appropriate inventory levels.\nAcceptable levels of credit losses at new dealerships. Credit losses tend to be higher at new dealerships due\nto fewer repeat customers and less experienced associates; therefore, the opening of new dealerships tends\nto increase the Company’s overall credit losses. This may require the Company to incur additional costs to\nreduce future credit losses or to close the underperforming locations altogether. Any of these circumstances\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nHistorically, the Company’s third fiscal quarter (November through January) has been the slowest period\nfor vehicle sales. Conversely, the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters (May through July and February\nthrough April) have historically been the busiest times for vehicle sales. Therefore, the Company generally realizes\na higher proportion of its revenue and operating profit during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. The Company\nexpects this pattern to continue in future years.\n19\nIf conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or fourth fiscal quarters, the adverse effect on\nthe Company’s revenues and operating results for the year could be disproportionately large.\nThe effects of any future public health crisis could have a significant impact on our business, sales, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 led to severe disruptions in general economic activities, particularly\nretail operations, as businesses and federal, state, and local governments implemented mandates to mitigate this\npublic health crisis. The pandemic has affected consumer demand and the overall health of the U.S. economy. The\neffects of any future outbreaks of the pandemic or similar health crises could negatively impact all aspects of our\nbusiness, including used vehicle sales and financing, finance receivable collections, repossession activity and\ninventory acquisition. Our business is also dependent on the continued health and productivity of our associates,\nincluding management teams, throughout this crisis. The consequences of any future adverse public health\ndevelopments could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nAdditionally, our liquidity could be negatively impacted if economic conditions were to once again\ndeteriorate due to a future COVID-19 outbreak or other public health crisis, which could require us to pursue\nadditional sources of financing to obtain working capital, maintain appropriate inventory levels, support the\norigination of vehicle financing, and meet our financial obligations. Capital and credit markets were significantly\naffected by onset of the crisis and could be disrupted once again by any future wave of the virus or outbreak of a\nnew coronavirus variant, and our ability to obtain any new or additional financing is not guaranteed and largely\ndependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors.\nThe Company may have a higher risk of delinquency and default than traditional lenders because it finances its\nsales of used vehicles to credit-impaired borrowers.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s automobile contracts involve financing to individuals with impaired or\nlimited credit histories, or higher debt-to-income ratios than permitted by traditional lenders. Financing made to\nborrowers who are restricted in their ability to obtain financing from traditional lenders generally entails a higher\nrisk of delinquency, default and repossession, and higher losses than financing made to borrowers with better credit.\nDelinquency interrupts the flow of projected interest income and repayment of principal from a contract, and a\ndefault can ultimately lead to a loss if the net realizable value of the automobile securing the contract is insufficient\nto cover the principal and interest due on the contract or if the vehicle cannot be recovered. The Company’s\nprofitability depends, in part, upon its ability to properly evaluate the creditworthiness of non-prime borrowers and\nefficiently service such contracts. Although the Company believes that its underwriting criteria and collection\nmethods enable it to manage the higher risks inherent in financing made to non-prime borrowers, no assurance can\nbe given that such criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against such risks.If the Company experiences\nhigher losses than anticipated, its financial condition, results of operations and business prospects could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, which could adversely\naffect its financial condition and operating results.\nWhen applicable, the Company has to recognize losses resulting from the inability of certain borrowers to\npay contracts and the insufficient realizable value of the collateral securing contracts. The Company maintains an\nallowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover net credit losses expected overthe remaining life of the contracts\nin the portfolio at the measurement date. Additional credit losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a\nrate greater than the Company has experienced to date. The allowance for credit losses represents management’s\nbest estimate of lifetime expected losses based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, historical credit loss\nexperience,changes in contractual characteristics (i.e., average amount financed, term, and interest rates),and other\n20\nqualitative considerations, such as credit quality trends, collateral values, current and forecasted economic\nconditions, underwriting and collections practices, concentration risk, credit review, and other external factors.This\nevaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates of material factors that may be susceptible to significant\nchange. If the Company’s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect, its current allowancefor credit losses\nmay not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse\ndevelopments in its contract portfolio which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results\nof operations. At April 30, 2024 the Company had anallowance for credit losses at 25.32% (compared to23.91%\nat April 30, 2023) of the principal balance of finance receivables, net of deferred revenueand pending APP claims.\nThe increase in the allowancefor credit losseswasprimarily due tocontinuing inflationary pressure on customers\nand the update to our calculation methodology and the performance of our loan portfolio in the second quarter of\nthe fiscal year 2024. Any future deterioration in economic conditions or consumer financial health may result in\nadditional future credit losses that may not be fully reflected in the allowance for credit losses.\nThe Company’s success depends upon the continued contributions of its management teams and the ability to\nattract and retain qualified employees.\nThe Company is dependent upon the continued contributions of its management teams. Because the\nCompany maintains a decentralized operation in which each dealership is responsible for inspecting and selling its\nown vehicles, making credit decisions and collecting contracts it originates, the key employees at each dealership\nare important factors in the Company’s ability to implement its business strategy. Consequently, the loss of the\nservices of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. In addition,\nwhen the Company decides to open new dealerships, the Company will need to hire additional personnel. The\nmarket for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which the Company operates is highly\ncompetitive and may subject the Company to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment or times\nof increased competition for labor.\nThe Company’s business is dependent upon the efficient operation of its information systems.\nThe Company relies on its information systems in managing its sales, inventory, consumer financing, and\ncustomer information effectively. The failure of the Company’s information systems to perform as designed, or the\nfailure to maintain and continually enhance or protect the integrity of these systems, could disrupt the Company’s\nbusiness, impact sales and profitability, or expose the Company to customer or third-party claims.\nSecurity breaches, cyber-attacks or fraudulent activity could result in damage to the Company's operations or lead\nto reputational damage.\nOur information and technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses,\nnetwork failures, computer and telecommunications failures, infiltration by unauthorized persons and security\nbreaches, usage errors by our employees, power outages and catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, floods,\nhurricanes and earthquakes.A security breach of the Company's computer systems could also interrupt or damage\nits operations or harm its reputation. In addition, the Company could be subject to liability if confidential customer\ninformation is misappropriated from its computer systems. Any compromise of security, including security breaches\nperpetrated on persons with whom the Company has commercial relationships, that result in the unauthorized\nrelease of its users’ personal information, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant\nlegal and financial exposure, damage to the Company's reputation, and a loss of confidence in the Company's\nsecurity measures, which could harm its business. Any compromise of security could deter people from entering\ninto transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to the Company's systems and could harm\nrelationships with the Company's suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.\nActual or anticipated attacks may cause the Company to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional\npersonnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Despite the\nimplementation of security measures, these systems may still be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses,\nprogramming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. The Company may not have the\nresources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.\n21\nMost of the Company's customers provide personal information when applying for financing.The Company\nrelies on encryption and authentication technology to provide security to effectively store and securely transmit\nconfidential information.Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other\ndevelopments may result in the technology used by the Company to protect transaction data being breached or\ncompromised.\nIn addition, many of the third parties who provide products, services, or support to the Company could also\nexperience any of the above cyber risks or security breaches, which could impact the Company's customers and its\nbusiness and could result in a loss of customers, suppliers, or revenue.\nWe may be unable to keep pace with technological advances and changes in consumer behavior affecting our\nbusiness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to facilitate digital sales leads. Our ability to optimize our\ndigital sales platform is affected by online search engines and classified sites that are not direct competitors but that\nmay direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers. These third-party sites could make it\nmore difficult for us to market our vehicles online and attract customers to our online offerings. Further, to address\nchanges in consumer buying preferences and to improve customer experience, inventory procurement and recruiting\nand training, we make corresponding technology and systems upgrades. We may not be able to establish sufficient\ntechnological upgrades to support evolving consumer buying preferences and to keep pace with our competitors. If\nthese systems fail to perform as designed or if we fail to respond effectively to consumer buying preferences or\nkeep pace with technological advances by our competitors, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing could adversely affect the Company’s\ngrowth and business strategies, and volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes\nin the global economy could have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to access the credit markets in the\nfuture and/or obtain credit on favorable terms.\nThe Company generates cash from income from continuing operations. The cash is primarily used to fund\nfinance receivables growth. To the extent finance receivables growth exceeds income from continuing operations,\nthe Company generally increases its borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and,more recently,has issued\nnon-recourse notes through asset-back securitization transactions to provide the cash necessary to fund operations.\nOn a long-term basis, the Company expects its principal sources ofliquidity to consist of income from continuing\noperations and borrowings under revolving credit facilities and/or term securitizations. Any adverse changes in the\nCompany’s ability to borrow under revolving credit facilities or by accessing the securitization market, or any\nincrease in the cost of such borrowings, would likely have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to finance\nreceivables growth which would adversely affect the Company’s growth and business strategies. Further, the\nCompany’s current credit facilities and non-recourse notes payable contain various reporting and/or financial\nperformance covenants. Any failure of the Company to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition, cash flow and ability to implement its business\nstrategy.\nIf the capital and credit markets experience disruptions and/or the availability of funds becomes restricted,\nit is possible that the Company’s ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or available on less\nfavorable terms which could have an impact on the Company’s ability to refinance maturing debt or react to\nchanging economic and business conditions.In addition, if negative domestic or global economic conditions persist\nfor an extended period of time or worsen substantially, the Company’s business may suffer in a manner which could\ncause the Company to fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants under its credit facilities.\nThe impact of climate-change related events, including efforts to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change\nand inclement weather can adversely impact the Company’s operating results.\n22\nThe effects of climate change such as natural disasters or the occurrence of weather events, such as rain,\nsnow, wind, storms, hurricanes, or other natural disasters, which can adversely affect consumer traffic and\noperations at the Company’sautomotive dealershipsas well as customers’ ability to make their car payments, could\nnegatively impact the Company’s operating results. Further, the pricing of used vehicles is affected by, among other\nfactors, consumer preferences, which may be impacted by consumer perceptions of climate change and consumer\nefforts to mitigate or reduce climate change-related events by purchasing vehicles that are viewed as more fuel\nefficient (including vehicles powered primarily or solely through electricity). An increase in the supply or a decrease\nin the demand for used vehicles may impact the resale value of the vehicles the Company sells. Moreover, the\nimplementation of new or revised laws or regulations designed to address or mitigate the potential impacts of\nclimate change (including laws which may adversely impact the auto industry in particular as a result of efforts to\nmitigate the factors contributing to climate change) could have a significant impact on the Company. Consequently,\nthe impact of climate change-related events, including efforts to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change,\nmay adversely impact the Company’s operating results.\nThe Company’s stock trading volume may result in greater volatility in the market price of the Company’s common\nstock and may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nAlthough shares of the Company’s common stock are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the\naverage daily trading volume in the Company’s common stock is less than that of other larger automotive retail\ncompanies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends\non the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any\ngiven time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market\nconditions over which the Company has no control. Given the average daily trading volume of the Company’s\ncommon stock, the market price of the Company’s common stock may be subject to greater volatility than\ncompanies with larger trading volumes as smaller transactions can more significantly impact the Company’s stock\nprice. Significant sales of the Company’s common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales,\ncould cause a decline in the price of the Company’s common stock. The price of the Company’s common stock\nmay also be subject to wide fluctuations based upon the Company’s operating results, general economic and market\nconditions, general trends and prospects for our industry, announcements by competitors, the Company’s ability to\nachieve any long-term targets or performance metrics and other factors. Any such fluctuations could increase the\nCompany’s risk of being subject to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs, divert\nmanagement’s attention and resources and have other material adverse impacts on the Company’s business.\nAdditionally, low trading volumes may limit a stockholder’s ability to sell shares of the Company’s common stock.\nThe Company currently does not intend to pay future dividends on its common stock.\nThe Company historically has not paid cash dividends on its common stock and currently does not\nanticipate paying future cash dividends on its common stock. Any determination to pay future dividends and other\ndistributions in cash, stock, or property by the Company in the future will be at the discretion of the Company’s\nBoard of Directors and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including the Company’s financial condition\nand results of operations and contractual restrictions. The Company is alsolimited in its ability to pay dividends or\nmake other distributions to its shareholders without the consent of its lender. Therefore, stockholders should not\nrely on future dividend income from shares of the Company’s common stock.\nNot applicable.\n23\nRisks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have not\nmaterially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Further\ninformation regarding cybersecurity risks can be found in Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nWe consider the protection of our customers’ and corporate data to be a priority within our business. We\ncontinually monitor and assess the cybersecurity landscape and invest in enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities\nand strengthening our partnerships with appropriate business partners, service partners, and government and law\nenforcement agencies to understand the range of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance\ndefenses, and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. Through these partnerships, we incorporate threat\nintelligence, security operations, continuous training, and penetration testing. We strive to reduce the threat\nlandscape for both the Company and our customers, through vigilantlymonitoring systems and general technology\ncontrols.\nOur efforts focus on protecting and enhancing the security of our information systems, software, networks,\nand other assets, whether commercial products or custom solutions. Our cybersecurity program focuses on\nprotecting and enhancing the security of our information systems, software, networks, and other assets, whether\ncommercial products or custom solutions. These efforts are under continuous review for improvement within the\nchanging threat landscape and are designed to protect against, and mitigate the effects of, cybersecurity incidents\nthat could result in unauthorized access to confidential, sensitive, or personal information of associates or customers\nor proprietary company information and potentially disrupt or impede our operations or otherwise cause harm to\nthe Company, our customers, suppliers, dealers, or other key stakeholders.\nOur cybersecurity program leverages both internal and external techniques and expertise across the\ncybersecurity spectrum. We maintain and utilize industry best practice capabilities, processes, and other security-\nrelated measures, based upon National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Control Objectives for\nInformation Technologies (CoBIT) frameworks. Our capabilities, processes, and other security measures include,\namong others:\nThreat detection through the use of security information and event management software;\nIncident management processes for any security-related activity, requiring senior management\nsignoff;\nCorporate endpoint detection and response software, which monitors for malicious activities on\nexternal-facing endpoints;\nCloud monitoring tools, running on primary public and private cloud environments;\nData encryption at rest and during transit and immutable data backups; and\nBusiness continuity, disaster recovery and incident response plans.\nWe also expect our suppliers to follow the same industry-standard security practices that we follow.\nDespite having thorough due diligence, onboarding, and cybersecurity assessment processes in place for our\nsuppliers, the responsibility ultimately rests with our suppliers to establish and uphold their respective cybersecurity\nprograms. The ability and availability of information to monitor the cybersecurity practices and controls of our\nsuppliers is limited, and there can be no assurance that we can prevent or mitigate the risk of any compromise or\nfailure in information systems, software, networks, and other assets owned or controlled by our suppliers. Although\nthe Company attempts to manage its exposure to such events through the purchase of cyber liability insurance, such\nevents are inherently unpredictable, and insurance may not be sufficient to protect the Company against all losses.\n24\nThere is no assurance that the Company's security systems or processes will prevent or mitigate future break-ins,\ntampering, security breaches or other cyber-related attacks.\nOur Board of Directors oversees the management of risks inherent in the operation of our business, with a\nfocus on the most significant risks that we face, including those related to cybersecurity. Our Board of Directors\nhas delegated oversight of cybersecurity, including privacy and information security, as well as enterprise risk\nmanagement to the Innovation and Technology Committee. In connection with that oversight responsibility, our\nSenior Vice Presidentof Technology and Chief Legal Officermeet withthe Innovation and Technology Committee\non a quarterly basis to provide information and updates on a range of cybersecurity topics which may include our\ncybersecurity program and governance processes; cyber risk monitoring and management; the status of projects to\nstrengthen our cybersecurity and privacy capabilities; recent significant incidents or threats impacting our\noperations, industry, or third-party suppliers; and the emerging threat landscape.\nOur information security team works closely with key stakeholders, including regulators, government\nagencies, law enforcement, peer institutions, industry groups, and develops and invests in talent and innovative\ntechnology to manage cybersecurity risk.\nWhen a cybersecurity threat or incident is identified, the Senior Vice President of Technology and the\nsecurity team works closely with cross functional committees, leveraging subject matter expertise across the\norganization, as part of our incident response plans and promptly providesinformation to senior management,with\nthe goal of timely assessing such incidents, determining applicable disclosure requirements and communicating\nwith the Chairs of the Innovation and Technology Committee and the Audit Committee, regarding any significant\ncybersecurity incidents, including those experienced by third party service providers, which may pose significant\nrisk to our business, customers, clients, associatesand stakeholders, and continues to provide regular reports until\nsuch incidents are concluded. The above framework tracks and allows team members to monitor each incident\nthroughout its lifecycle to ensure the Company is informed about and following cybersecurity incidents as they are\nmitigated and remediated. Post-incident reviews are also performed to determine if there are any additional controls\nthat may feasibly be implemented to prevent recurrence.\nAs of April 30, 2024, the Company leased approximately 86% of its facilities, including dealerships and\nthe Company’s corporate offices. These facilities are located principally in the states of Alabama, Arkansas,\nGeorgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. The Company’s corporate\noffices are located in approximately 50,000 square feet of leased space in Rogers, Arkansas. For additional\ninformation regarding the Company’s properties, see “Operations-Dealership Locations and Facilities” under Item\n1 above.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company has become a defendant in various types of legal\nproceedings. While the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not\nexpect the final outcome of any of these proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse\neffect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNot applicable.\n25\nThe Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CRMT.\nAs of June 19, 2024, there were approximately 988 shareholders of record. This number excludes\nstockholders holding the Company’s common stock as “beneficial owners” under nominee security position listings.\nSet forth below is a line graph comparing the fiscal year end percentage change in the cumulative total\nstockholder return on the Company’s common stock to (i) the cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Market Index\n(U.S. companies), and (ii) the market-weighted value of a customized peer group of automotive dealership\ncompanies (“Auto Dealerships”)composed of the common stock of Asbury Automotive Group, Inc.; AutoNation,\nInc.; CarMax, Inc.; Copart, Inc.; Group 1 Automotive, Inc.; Lithia Motors, Inc.; Penske Automotive Group, Inc.;\nRush Enterprises, Inc.; and Sonic Automotive, Inc. for the period of five fiscal years commencing on May 1, 2019\nand ending on April 30, 2024.\nThe graph assumes that the value of the investment in the Company’s common stock and each index or\npeer group was $100 on April 30, 2019.\n* $100 invested on 4/30/2019 in stock or index, including reinvestment of dividends.\nFiscal year ending April 30.\n26\nThe dollar value at April 30, 2024 of $100 invested in the Company’s common stock on April 30, 2019\nwas $57.79, compared to $201.71 for the NASDAQ Market Index (U.S. Companies) and $249.06 for the Auto\nDealerships peer group.\nSince its inception,the Company has paid no cash dividends on its common stock.The Company currently\nintends for the foreseeable future to continue itspolicy of retaining earnings to finance future growth. Payment of\ncash dividends in the future will be determined by the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon, among\nother things, the Company's future earnings, operations, capital requirements and surplus, general financial\ncondition, contractual restrictions that may exist, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem\nrelevant. The Company is also limited in its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders\nwithout the consent of its lender. Please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” under Item 7 of Part II for more\ninformation regarding this limitation.\nThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock under its common stock repurchase\nprogram. On December 14, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional one million\nshares along with the balance remaining under its previous authorization approved and announced on November\n16, 2017. No shares of the Company’s common stock were purchased under the Company’s stock repurchase\nprogram during fiscal 2024.\n27\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial\nStatementsand Notes theretoappearing in Item 8 of this Annual Reporton Form 10-K.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation (the “Company”), is one of the largest publicly held\nautomotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the “Integrated Auto Sales and Finance” segment\nof the used car market. References to the Company include the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries. The\nCompany’s operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries, America’s Car Mart, Inc.,\nan Arkansas corporation (“Car-Mart of Arkansas”), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation\n(“Colonial”).Collectively, Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial are referred to herein as “Car-Mart.” The Company\nprimarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers. Many of the\nCompany’s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result\nof limited credit histories or past credit problems. As of April 30, 2024, the Company operated 154 dealerships\nlocated primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States.\nCar-Mart has been operating since 1981. While Car-Mart has grown its revenues between approximately\n3.5% and 31.2% per year over the last tenyearspreceding 2024 (average 12.0%),revenue for the fiscal year ended\nApril 30, 2024, declined slightlycompared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to an 8.8% decrease in retail units sold.The\ndecrease was partially offset by a 5.7% increase in the average retail sales price and an 18.8% increase in interest\nincome.\nThe Company earns revenue from the sale of used vehicles, and in most cases a related service contract and\nan accident protection plan product, as well as interest income and late fees from the related financing. The\nCompany’s cost structure is more fixed in nature and is sensitive to volume changes. Revenue can be affected by\nour level of competition, which is influenced to a large extent by the availability of funding to the sub-prime\nautomobile industry, together with the availability and resulting purchase cost of the types of vehicles the Company\npurchases for resale.Revenues can also be affected by the macro-economic environment. Down payments, contract\nterm lengths and credit scoring are critical to helping customers succeed and are monitored closely by corporate\nmanagement at the point of sale. After the sale, collections, delinquencies, and charge-offs are crucial elements of\nthe Company’s evaluation of its financial condition and results of operations and are monitored and reviewed on a\ncontinuous basis. Management believes that developing and maintaining a relationship with its customers and\nearning their repeat business iscritical to the success and growth of the Company and can serve to offset the effects\nof increased competition and negative macro-economic factors.\nThe Company focuseson the benefits of excellent customer service and its“local” face-to-face offering in\nan effort to help customers succeed, while continuing to enhance the Company’s digital services and offerings to\nmeet growing demands for an integrated digital-online sales and service experience. The Company, over recent\nyears, has focused on providing a good mix of vehicles in various price ranges to increase affordability for\ncustomers.\nThe purchase price the Company pays for its vehicles can also have a significant effect on revenues,\nliquidity and capital resources. Because the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost of the vehicle,\nincreases in purchase costs result in increased selling prices. As the selling price increases, it becomes more difficult\nto keep the gross margin percentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company’s\ncustomers have limited incomes, and their car payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets.\nDecreases in the overall volume of new car sales, particularly domestic brands, lead to decreased supply and\ngenerally increased prices in the wholesale used car market. Also, expansions or constrictions in consumer credit,\nas well as general economic conditions, can have an overall effect on the demand and the resulting purchase cost\nof the types of vehicles the Company purchases for resale.\n28\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and the resulting macroeconomic effects have negatively impacted the\navailability and prices of the vehicles the Company purchases. Over the past threeyears, the reduction in new car\nproduction and fewer off-lease vehicles have negatively impacted the availability of used vehicle inventory and\nresulted in higher purchase costs. The Company constantly reviews and adjusts purchasing avenues to ensure an\nappropriate flow of vehicles. While the Company anticipates that the availability of used vehicles will remain\nconstricted and keep purchase costs elevated in the near future, any decline in overall market pressures affecting\nthe availability and costs ofused vehicles could result in lower inventory purchase costs and present an opportunity\nfor the Company to purchase slightly newer, lower mileage vehicle for its customers.\nThe Company consistently focuses on collections. Each dealership is responsible for its own collections\nwith supervisory involvement of the corporate office.Over the last five fiscal years, the Company’s provision for\ncredit losses as a percentage of sales has ranged from a low of approximately 19.31% in fiscal 2021 to 36.48% in\nfiscal 2024(average of 26.36%). Creditloss resultsimproved substantially in fiscal 2021 due to a lower frequency\nof losses and lower severity of loss amounts relative to the principal balance as the CARES Act enhanced\nunemployment and stimulus funds, combined with the Company’s commitment to working with customers, aided\ncustomers’ ability to make their vehicle payments. The improvement in credit losses as a percentage of sales for\nfiscal 2021 was further accelerated by the Company’s decision during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to reduce\nthe allowance for credit losses back to 23.55% of finance receivables, net of deferred revenue, which resulted in a\n$14.2million pretax decrease in the provision for credit losses.Thefiscal year 2022 credit losses began to normalize\nto pre-pandemic levels but were still below historical levels despite the increase in the average retail sales price.\nDuring fiscal year 2023,credit losses exceededpre-pandemic levels,partially driven bythe lack of federal stimulus\npayments in the current fiscal year as compared to prior fiscal years due to the expiration of the CARES Act and\nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021,and partially driven by the currentmacro-economic environment at\nthat time. During fiscal 2024, the provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales increased to 36.5%, primarily\ndue to the $28 million increase in provision for credit losses during the three months ended October 31, 2023. The\nallowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables, net of deferred revenue and pending accident\nprotection plan (“APP”) claims, increased from 23.91%at April 30, 2023 to 26.04% at October 31, 2023due to the\nimplementation of the third-party software to assist in calculating the allowance for credit losses as well as the\nperformance of the loan portfolio during the first six months of fiscal 2024. Based on the Company’s current\nanalysis of credit losses, the allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2024 decreased to 25.32% of finance\nreceivables, net of deferred revenue and pending APP claims, which was primarily driven by changes in the\nunderwriting process and refinement to the underwriting guidelines due to the implementation of the Company’s\nnew loan origination system. Following the implementation of our new loan origination system (LOS), we have\nexperienceda notable decrease in the frequency and loss rate in charge-offs for loans originated through the LOS\nas compared to loans that were originated during the same period and the same dealership state using the legacy\nsystem. All the underwriting information for loans originated through the LOS is centrally located in the system,\nallowing dealerships to view internal scores, down-paymentpercentages, pre-qualificationcredit reports and other\ncustomer information. Historically, dealerships have had to obtain this information from several sources. These\nchanges to the underwriting process and refinement to our underwriting guidelines facilitate better-informed\nunderwriting decisions due to all the information being readily available in a single location.\nHistorically, credit losses, on a percentage basis, tend to be higher at new and developing dealerships than\nat mature dealerships.Generally, this is because the management at new and developing dealerships tends to be less\nexperienced in making credit decisions and collecting customer accounts and the customer base is less seasoned.\nMore mature dealerships have more repeat customers and,on average, repeat customers are a better credit risk than\nnon-repeat customers. Credit losses and charge-offs can alsobe impacted by market and economic factors, including\na competitive used vehicle financing environment and macro-economic conditions such as inflation in the price of\nchildcare, insurance, rent, gasoline, groceries, and other staple items. Negative macro-economic issues, however,\ndo not always lead to higher credit loss results for the Company because the Company provides basic affordable\ntransportation which in many cases is not a discretionary expenditure for customers.\nThe Company continuouslylooks for waysto operate more efficiently, improve its business practices and\nadjust underwriting and collection procedures. The Company has a proprietary credit scoring system which enables\n29\nthe Company to monitor the quality of contracts. Corporate office personnel monitor proprietary credit scores and\nwork with dealerships when the distribution of scores falls outside of prescribed thresholds.The Company alsouses\ncredit reporting and the use of global positioning system (“GPS”) units on vehicles. Additionally, the Company’s\ntraining department continuously strengthens its training for collections. The Company’s collections department\nand support staff oversee collections and provide timely oversight and additional accountability on a consistent\nbasis. Collections growth is included in quarterly earnings reports.The Company believes that the proper execution\nof its business practices is the single most important determinant of its long-term credit loss experience.\nOver the last five fiscalyears, the Company’s gross margin as a percentage of sales has rangedfroma high\nof approximately 40.2% in fiscal 2021 to a low of 33.5% in fiscal 2023 (average of 36.9%). The gross margin\npercentage increased in fiscal 2024 to 34.7%. The Company’s initiatives around inventory life cycle efficiencies\nand a decrease in wholesale losses also contributed to the increase in gross profit percent.\nThe total gross dollarsper retail unit sold increasedfrom the prior fiscal year by $593,primarily as a result of the\nCompany selling on average a higher priced vehicle in fiscal 2024. The Company’s gross margin is based upon the\ncost of the vehicle purchased, with lower-priced vehicles typically having higher gross margin percentages but\nlower gross profit dollars. Gross marginis also affected by the percentage of wholesale sales to retail sales, which\nrelates for the most part to repossessed vehicles sold at or near cost. The Company plans to continue to focus on\nimproving gross margin dollars in the near term, as demonstrated by the increases during fiscal 2024 as well as\ncontinuing to focus on improving wholesale results through its partnership with reconditioning companies, cost\ncontrols, and operational improvement around the acquisition and disposal of vehicles.\nHiring, training and retaining qualified associates is critical to the Company’s success. The Company’s\nability to add new dealerships and implement operating initiatives is dependent on having a sufficient number of\ntrained managers and support personnel. Excessive turnover, particularly at the dealership manager level, could\nimpact the Company’s ability to add new dealershipsand to meet operational initiatives. The landscape for hiring\nremains very competitive. The Company has continued to add resources to recruit, train, and develop personnel,\nespecially personnel targeted to fill dealershipmanager positions.The Company expects to continue to invest in the\ndevelopment of its workforce.\n30\nConsolidated Operations\n(Operating Statement Dollars in Thousands)\n% Change\n2024 2023\nYears Ended April 30, vs. vs. As a % of Sales\n2024 2023 2022 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022\nRevenues:\nSales $ 1,160,798 $ 1,204,194 $ 1,038,682 (3.6)% 15.9% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nInterest and other income 233,096 196,219 151,853 18.8 29.2 20.1 16.3 14.6\nTotal 1,393,894 1,400,413 1,190,535 (0.5) 17.6 120.1 116.3 114.6\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales, excluding depreciation\nshown below 758,546 800,788 658,615 (5.3)% 21.6 % 65.3 66.5 63.4\nSelling, general and administrative 179,421 176,696 156,130 1.5 13.2 15.5 14.7 15.0\nProvision for credit losses 423,406 352,860 238,054 20.0 48.2 36.5 29.3 22.9\nInterest expense 65,348 38,312 10,919 70.6 250.9 5.6 3.2 1.1\nDepreciation and amortization 6,871 5,602 4,033 22.7 38.9 0.6 0.5 0.4\nLoss on disposal of property\nand equipment 437 361 149 21.1 142.3 - - -\nTotal 1,434,029 1,374,619 1,067,900 4.3 28.7 123.5 114.2 102.8\n(Loss) income before income taxes $ (40,135) $ 25,794 $ 122,635 (3.5)% 2.1 % 11.8 %\nRetail units sold 57,989 63,584 60,595 (8.8)% 4.9 %\nAverage dealerships in operation 154 155 152 (0.6) 2.0\nAverage units sold per dealership per month 31.4 34.2 33.2 (8.2) 3.0\nAverage retail sales price $ 19,113 $ 18,080 $ 16,372 5.7 10.4\nGross profit per retail unit sold $ 6,937 $ 6,344 $ 6,272 9.3 1.1\nSame store revenue growth (1.0)% 16.7% 30.1%\nReceivables average yield 16.2% 15.7% 15.8%\nTotal revenues decreased $6.5 million, or 0.5%, in fiscal 2024, as compared to revenue growth of 17.6% in\nfiscal 2023, principally as a result of declines in revenuefrom (i)dealerships that operated a full twelve months in\nboth fiscal years ($13.8million), and (ii)dealerships that were closed duringor after the year ended April 30, 2023\n($14.9 million), partially offset by revenue growth from (iii) dealerships opened or acquired after April 30, 2023\n($22.2million).The decline in revenue for fiscal 2024is attributable to an 8.8%decreasein retail units sold, largely\nreflecting the challenging macroeconomic environment for our customers,partially offset by an 18.8% increase in\ninterest and other income and a 5.7% increase in the average retail sales price. Interest income increased\napproximately $36.9 million compared to fiscal 2023, due to the $187.9 million increase in average finance\nreceivables.\nCost of sales, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 65.3% compared to 66.5% in fiscal 2023,resulting in\nan increasein the gross margin percentage to 34.7% ofsales in fiscal 2024from 33.5% of sales in fiscal 2023.On\na dollar basis, our gross margin per retail unit sold increased by $593in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.The\naverage retail sales price for fiscal 2024was $19,113, a $1,033increase over the prior fiscal year,with over half of\nthe increaseattributable to vehicle price and the remaining related to ancillary products.As purchasecosts increase,\nthe margin between the purchase cost and the sales price of the vehicles we sellgenerally narrows on a percentage\nbasis because the Company must offer affordable prices to our customers. The Company initiated a strategic\npartnership with an industry leaderandimplementedinitiatives around vehicle reconditioning efforts, transportation\nand scaling are expected to provide a better volume of affordable units.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales increased to 15.5% in fiscal 2024\nfrom 14.7% for fiscal 2023. Selling, general and administrativeexpenses are, for the most part, more fixed in nature.\nIn dollar terms, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.8million from fiscal 2023.The increase\nresulted from increased collections costs due primarily to a higher frequency of repossessions and increased\n31\nspending in professional services around improvements in technology, as well as operating in a higher inflationary\nenvironment, which was partially offset by operational improvements and cost-cutting measures implemented in\nfiscal 2024. These efforts resulted in the lowest percentage change in annual selling, general and administrative\nexpenses in over five years at just a 1.5% increase.\nProvision for credit losses as a percentage of sales increased to 36.5% for fiscal 2024compared to 29.3% for\nfiscal 2023.The provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales was higher during the current year due to the\ngrowth in the balance of finance receivables, net of deferred revenue of $61.7million, coupled with a decrease in\nsalesof $43.4 million.An increase in net charge-offs also contributed to the higher provision. Net charge-offs as a\npercentage of average finance receivables increased to 27.2% for fiscal 2024compared to 23.3% for the prior\nyear.The Company experienced continued increases in both the frequency and severity of losses, with the\nfrequency increase accounting for over 80% of the increase as the Company’s customers continue toface\npressures on higher average costs of everyday items. Severity was also higher due to the longer terms and lower\nrecovery values.The increased frequency and severity of losses was partially mitigated by improved collection\nresults from loans originated using our new LOS system compared to our outstanding loans originated under our\nlegacy system. Approximately 20% of the portfolio balance of April 30, 2024 originated under the new LOS\nsystem.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2024as a percentage of sales increased to 5.6% in fiscal 2024from 3.2% in fiscal\n2023. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the higher interest rates in 2024 as well as the higher\naverage borrowings in fiscal 2024($730.3 million in fiscal 2024compared to $568.3 million for fiscal 2023).60%\nof the increase in interest expense is attributable to the higher interest rates in 2024 and 40% is attributable to the\nincrease in borrowings.\nTotal revenues increased $209.9 million, or 17.6%, in fiscal 2023, as compared to revenue growth of 31.2%\nin fiscal 2022, principally as a result of (i) revenue growth from dealerships that operated a full twelve months in\nboth fiscal years ($196.7 million), and (ii) revenue from stores opened or acquired during or after the year ended\nApril 30, 2022 ($15.3 million), partially offset by (iii) decreased revenue from dealerships closed during or after\nthe year ended April 30, 2022 ($2.1 million). The increase in revenue for fiscal 2023 is attributable to (i) a 10.4%\nincrease in average retail sales price, (ii) a 4.9% increase in retail units sold and (iii) a 29.2% increase in interest\nand other income, due to the $289.2 million increase in average finance receivables.\nCost of sales, as a percentage of sales, increased to 66.5% compared to 63.4% in fiscal 2022, resulting in a\ndecrease in the gross margin percentage to 33.5% of sales in fiscal 2023 from 36.6% of sales in fiscal 2022. On a\ndollar basis, our gross margin per retail unit sold increased by $72 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The\naverage retail sales price for fiscal 2023 was $18,080, a $1,708 increase over the prior fiscal year, reflecting the\nhigh demand for used cars, especially in the market we serve. As purchase costs increase, the margin between the\npurchase cost and the sales price of the vehicles we sell generally narrows on a percentage basis because the\nCompany must offer affordable prices to our customers. Demand for the vehicles we purchase for resale remained\nhigh during fiscal 2023 and the supply continued to be restricted primarily due to lower levels of new car production.\nThe inflationary environment during fiscal 2023 also contributed to the lower gross margin percentage due to\nincreased costs of vehicle parts, shop labor rates and transport services.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales decreased to 14.7% in fiscal 2023\nfrom 15.0% for fiscal 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses are, for the most part, more fixed in nature.\nDuring fiscal 2023 we continued investments in inventory procurement, technology and digital areas as well as\ninvesting in key additions to our leadership team. In dollar terms, selling, general and administrative expenses\nincreased $20.6 million from fiscal 2022. These investments are expected to be leveraged, creating efficiencies in\nthe business allowing us to serve more customers in future years.\nProvision for credit losses as a percentage of sales increased to 29.3% for fiscal 2023 compared to 22.9%\n32\nfor fiscal 2022. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables increased to 23.3% for fiscal 2023\ncompared to 18.3% for the prior year. The stimulus payments during fiscal 2022 had positive impacts on collections\nand net charge-off metrics, while in fiscal 2023, the absence of stimulus payments, added inflationary pressures and\nthe current macro-economic environment had a negative impact on collections and net charge-off metrics. Net\ncharge offs began to normalize to pre-pandemic levels in late fiscal 2022 and continued to normalize during fiscal\n2023. The primary driver was an increased frequency of losses; however, the relative severity of losses also\nincreased.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2023 as a percentage of sales increased to 3.2% from 1.1% in fiscal 2022. The\nincrease in interest expense is primarily due to the higher interest rates in 2023 as well as the higher average\nborrowings in fiscal 2023 ($568.3 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $331.6 million for fiscal 2022). 71% of the\nincrease in interest expense is attributable to the higher interest rates in 2023 and 29% is attributable to the increase\nin borrowings.\nThe following table sets forth the major balance sheet accounts of the Company at April 30, 2024, 2023\nand 2022 (in thousands):\nApril 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAssets:\nFinance receivables, net $ 1,098,591 $ 1,063,460 $ 856,114\nInventory 107,470 109,290 115,302\nIncome taxes receivable, net 2,958 9,259 274\nProperty and equipment, net(1) 60,361 61,682 45,412\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 49,207 55,108 47,925\nDeferred revenue 120,781 120,469 92,491\nDeferred income tax liabilities, net 17,808 39,315 30,449\nNon-recourse notes payable, net 553,629 471,367 395,986\nRevolving line of credit, net 200,819 167,231 44,670\n(1) Prepaid expenses and other assets at April 30, 2022, reflects an immaterial reclassification of approximately $6.0 million of capitalized implementation costs\nrelated to a cloud-computing arrangement previously recorded in Property and equipment, net, and did not impact operating income.\nThe following table shows receivables growth compared to revenue growth during each of the past three\nfiscal years.For fiscal year 2024, growth in finance receivables, net of deferred revenue, of 4.9%exceeded revenue\ndecline of 0.5%, due primarily to the increases in term lengths of our installment sales contracts as the Company\nstrives to keep payments affordable for our customers.The Company currently anticipates that the growth in finance\nreceivables will generally be slightly higher than overall revenue growth on an annual basis due to overall term\nlength increases in our installment sales contracts, partially offset by improvements in underwriting and collection\nprocedures in an effort to reduce credit losses. The average term for installment sales contracts at April 30, 2024\nwas 47.9 months, compared to 46.3. months for April 30, 2023.\nYears Ended April 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nGrowth in finance receivables, net of deferred\nrevenue 4.9% 24.2% 34.1%\nRevenue growth (0.5)% 17.6% 31.2%\n33\nAt fiscal year-end 2024, inventory decreased 1.7% ($1.8 million), compared to fiscal year-end 2023. The\ndecreaseininventory reflects the Company’s initiatives around inventory life cycle efficiencies from procurement,\nreconditioning, wholesale efficienciesand repairs after the sale.Annualized inventory turns for fiscal year-end 2024\nwere 7.0 consistent with 7.1 for the prior year. The Company strives to improve the quality of the inventory and\nmaintain adequateturns while maintaining inventory levels to ensure an adequate supply of vehicles, in volume and\nmix, and to meet sales demand.\nProperty and equipment, net,decreased by approximately $1.3 millionasof April 30, 2024 as compared to\nfiscal 2023.The Company incurred approximately $6.1 million in expenditures during fiscal year 2024,primarily\nrelated to remodeling of existing locations.These expenditures were offset by $6.9 million in depreciation expense\nduring fiscal 2024.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by approximately $5.9 million at April 30, 2024 as\ncompared to April 30, 2023 primarily due to lower accounts payable related to decreased inventory and sales\nactivity.\nDeferred revenue increased $312,000 at April 30, 2024 over April 30, 2023, primarily resulting from the\nincrease in average retail sales price as well as the increased terms on the service contracts, partially offset by the\ndecrease inretail unit sold.\nDeferred income tax liabilities, net,decreasedapproximately $21.5millionon April 30, 2024, compared to\nApril 30, 2023. As of April 30, 2024, the Company had an expected federal net operating loss carryforward of $83\nmillion, which may be carried forward indefinitely until the loss is fully recovered.\nThe Company had $553.6 million and $471.4million of non-recourse notes payable outstanding related to\nasset-backed term funding transactions as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These notes accrue interest at\nfixed rates with a weighted average rate of 9.0% as of April 30, 2024.\nThe Company also maintains a revolving line of credit with a group of lenders with available borrowings\nbased on and secured by eligible finance receivables and inventory. Interest under the revolving credit facilities is\npayable monthly at an interest rate determined based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio for the preceding\nfiscal quarter. The current applicable interest rate under the credit facilities is generally the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR) plus 3.50%. Borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facilities fluctuate primarily\nbased upon a number of factors including (i) net income, (ii) finance receivables changes, (iii) funds available from\nasset-backed securitization offerings and/or warehouse facilities, (iv) income taxes, (v) capital expenditures, and\n(vi) common stock repurchases.At April 30, 2024and 2023the Company had $200.8 million and $167.2 million,\nrespectively, in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities.\nHistorically, income from continuing operations, as well as borrowings on the revolving credit facilities,\nhave funded the Company’s finance receivables growth, capital asset purchases, and common stock repurchases.\nThe Company also utilizes the securitization market andhas recently entered into a warehouse facilityto increase\nits borrowing capacities, with issuances of asset-backed non-recourse notes which may cause the revolving line of\ncredit to fluctuate between securitization issuances. The overall increase in total borrowings during fiscal 2024 was\nmade to support an increase in finance receivables, with longer terms, and a growing customer base. This was\npartially offset by the payoff of the April 2022 asset-backed notes in the third quarterof fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company grew finance receivables by $62.0 million, decreased inventory by $1.8\nmillion, and purchased investments and fixed assets of $11.0 million with a $115.8 million increase in total debt\nand a $89.4 million increase in debt, net of cash (a non-GAAP Measure). See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\nbelow for a reconciliation of debt, net of cash, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These\ninvestments reflect our commitment to providing the necessary inventory and facilities to support a growing\ncustomer base.\n34\nThe following table sets forth certain historical information with respect to the Company’s Statements of\nCash Flows (in thousands):\nYears Ended April 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating activities:\nNet income $ (31,393) $ 20,432 $ 95,014\nProvision for credit losses 423,406 352,860 238,054\nLosses on claims for accident protection plan 34,504 25,107 21,871\nDepreciation and amortization 6,871 5,602 4,033\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 5,139 5,461 775\nStock based compensation 4,174 5,314 5,496\nDeferred income taxes (21,507) 8,866 8,750\nFinance receivable originations (1,079,946) (1,161,132) (1,009,858)\nFinance receivable collections 455,828 434,458 417,796\nAccrued interest on finance receivables (792) (1,188) (1,559)\nInventory 139,186 133,047 51,057\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities (9,338) 8,621 5,167\nDeferred accident protection plan revenue (1,229) 17,150 21,850\nDeferred service contract revenue 1,540 24,542 30,645\nIncome taxes, net 6,301 (8,984) (424)\nOther(1) (6,642) (5,884) (7,845)\nTotal (73,898) (135,728) (119,178)\nInvesting activities:\nPurchase of investments (4,815) (5,549) (1,574)\nPurchase of property and equipment(1) (6,146) (22,106) (15,796)\nProceeds from sale of property and equipment 316 84 20\nTotal (10,645) (27,571) (17,350)\nFinancing activities:\nDebt facilities, net 27,330 119,580 (186,037)\nNon-recourse debt, net 83,381 72,900 399,994\nChange in cash overdrafts 823 - (1,802)\nPurchase of common stock (365) (5,196) (34,698)\nDividend payments (40) (40) (40)\nExercise of stock options, including\ntax benefits and issuance of common stock (173) 1,502 (1,195)\nTotal 110,956 188,746 176,222\nIncrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 26,413 $ 25,447 $ 39,694\n(1) Prepaid expenses and other assets at April 30, 2022, reflects an immaterial reclassification of approximately $6.0 million ofcapitalized implementation costs\nrelated to a cloud-computing arrangement previously recorded in Property and equipment, net, and did not impact operating income.\nThe primary drivers of operating profits and cash flows include (i) top line sales (ii) interest income on\nfinance receivables, (iii) gross margin percentages on vehicle sales, and (iv) credit losses, a significant portion of\nwhich relates to the collection of principal on finance receivables. Historically, most of the cash generated from\noperations has been used to fund finance receivables growth, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases.\nTo the extent finance receivables growth,common stock repurchases, and capital expendituresexceed income from\noperations, the Company has increased borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and secured additional\nfunding through the issuance of asset-backed non-recourse notes.\n35\nCash flows used in operating activities for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 decreased primarily as a\nresult of (i) an increase in the provision for credit losses and (ii) a decrease in finance receivable originations,\npartially offset by an (iii) increase incash used for accounts payable and accrued liabilities and (iv) a net loss.\nCash flows used in operating activities for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 increased primarily as a\nresult of(i)an increase infinance receivable originations and (ii)a decreasein deferred revenue,partially offset by\nan increase in (iii) finance receivable collections.\nThe purchase price the Company pays for a vehicle has a significant effect on liquidity and capital resources.\nBecause the Company bases its selling price on the purchase cost for the vehicle, increases in purchase costs result\nin higher selling prices. As the selling price increases, it generally becomes more difficult to keep the gross margin\npercentage and contract term in line with historical results because the Company’s customers have limited incomes,\nand their car payments must remain affordable within their individual budgets. Several external factors can\nnegatively affect the purchase cost of vehicles. Decreases in the overall volume of new car sales, particularly\ndomestic brands, lead to decreased supplyin the used car market. Also,constrictions in consumer credit, as well as\ngeneral economic conditions, can increase overall demand for the types of vehicles the Company purchases for\nresale as used vehicles become more attractive than new vehicles in times of economic instability.A negative shift\nin used vehicle supply, combined with strong demandfor used vehicles, results in increased used vehicle prices and\nthus higher purchase costs for the Company.\nSustainedmacro-economic pressures affecting our customers have helped keep demand high in recent years\nfor the types of vehicles we purchase. This strong demand for used vehicles, coupled with modest levels of new\nvehicle salesin recent years,have led to a generally ongoing tight supply of used vehicles available to the Company\ninboth quality and quantity. Wholesale prices continued to soften in calendar year 2024but remain high compared\nto the last several years. The Company expects the tight used vehicle supply and strong demand for the types of\nvehicles we purchase to continue to keep purchase costs and resulting sales prices elevated for the short term but\nanticipates that an increase inmarketplace wages for our customers could enhance affordability.\nThe Company has devoted significant efforts to improving its purchasing processes to ensure adequate\nsupply at appropriate priceswhich includes the new partnershipwith an industry leader,expanding its purchasing\nterritories to larger cities in close proximity to its dealerships and forming relationships with reconditioning partners\nto reduce purchasing costs. The Company has also increased the level of accountability for its purchasing agents\nincluding updates tosourcing and pricing guidelines. The Company continues to build relationships with national\nvendors that can supply a large quantity of high-quality vehicles.\nThe Company’s liquidity is also impacted by our credit losses. Macro-economic factors such as\nunemployment levels and general inflation on core and discretionary items can significantly affect our collection\nresults and ultimately credit losses.Currently, as our customers look to cover rising costs of non-discretionary items,\nsuch as childcare, insurance, groceries and gasoline, it may impact their ability to make their car payments. The\nCompany has made improvements to its business processes via the implementation of the loan origination system\nduring the last two yearsto strengthen controls and provide stronger infrastructure to supportits collections efforts.\nThe Company continues to strive to reduce credit losses in spite of the current economic challenges and continued\ncompetitive pressures by improving deal structures. Management continues to focus on improved execution at the\ndealership level, specifically as related to working individually with customers concerning collection issues.\nThe Company’s collection results, credit losses and liquidity are also affected by the availability of funding\nto the sub-prime auto industry. In recent years, increased competition as well as the increasing used car prices\nresulting from the availability of funding to the sub-prime auto industry has contributed to the Company reducing\ndown payments and lengthening contract terms for our customers, which negatively pressured collection\npercentages and credit losses and increased our need for external sources of liquidity. During fiscal years 2023 and\n2024, the availability of credit to the Company’s customer base was somewhat dampened but remained near recent\nhistorical levels. The Company believes that the amount of credit available for the sub-prime auto industry, even\n36\nwith it tightening in 2023 and 2024, will remain relatively consistent with levels in recent years, which management\nexpects will contribute to continued demand for most, if not all, of the vehicles the Company purchases for resale.\nThe Company’s business model relies on leasingthe majority – approximately 86% as of April 30, 2024 –\nof the properties where its dealershipsare located. At April 30, 2024the Company had $82.9million of operating\nlease commitments, including $23.8million of non-cancelable lease commitments under the lease terms, and $59.1\nmillion of lease commitments for renewal periods at the Company’s option that are reasonably assured. Of the $82.9\nmillion in lease obligations, $42.4 million of these commitments will become due in more than five years. The\nCompany expects to continue to lease the majority of the properties where its dealerships are located.\nThe Company’s revolving credit facilities generally restrict distributions by the Company to its\nshareholders. The distribution limitations under the credit facilities allow the Company to repurchase the\nCompany’s stock ifeither: (a) the aggregate amount of such repurchases after September 30, 2021does not exceed\n$50 million, net of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and the total availability under the credit\nfacilities is equal to or greater than 20% of the sum of the borrowing bases,in each case after giving effect to such\nrepurchases (repurchases under this item are excluded from fixed charges for covenant calculations), or (b) the\naggregate amount of such repurchases does not exceed 75% of the consolidated net income of the Company\nmeasured on a trailing twelve month basis; provided that immediately before and after giving effect to the stock\nrepurchases, at least 12.5% of the aggregate funds committed under the credit facilities remain available. Thus,\nalthough the Company does routinely repurchase stock, the Company is limited in its ability to pay dividends or\nmake other distributions to its shareholders without the consent of the Company’s lenders.\nAt April 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $5.5 million of cash on hand and $73.4 million of\navailability under its revolving credit facilities (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statementsin Item 8).On\na short-term basis, the Company’s principal sources of liquidity include income from operations, proceeds from\nnon-recourse notes payable issued under asset-back securitization transactions, warehouse facilities, borrowings\nunder its revolving credit facilities, and other potential financing sources. On a longer-term basis, the Company\nexpects its principal sources of liquidity to consist of income from operations, funding from asset-back\nsecuritization transactions, warehouse facilities, borrowings under revolving credit facilities or fixed interest term\nloans, and other potential financing sources.In February 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 6to its\nrevolving credit agreement (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which extends the term of the\nCompany’s revolving credit facilities to September 30, 2025,and reduces the total permitted borrowings from $600\nmillion to $340 million. The reduction in the facility size relates primarily to the Company’s utilization of funding\nfrom recent issuances of asset-backed non-recourse notes, as well as two lenders withdrawing from the facility in\nconnection with the Amendment. In July 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 7 to its revolving credit\nagreement to allow for, among other things, the entry into an amortizingwarehouse agreementwith recourse against\nthe Company with respect to up to 10% of the aggregate amount borrowed under the warehouse facility and to\namendthe fixed charge coverage ratio under the credit agreement.\nThe Company expects to use cash from operations and borrowings to (i) grow its finance receivables\nportfolio, (ii) purchase fixed assets of approximately $6 million in the next 12 months as we complete facility\nupdates and general fixed asset requirements, (iii) repurchase shares of common stock when favorable conditions\nexist and (iv) reduce debt to the extent excess cash is available. The Company projects total interest payments of\n69.6 millionover the next twelve monthsas of April 30, 2024, and approximately $34.5million to be paid thereafter\nbased on its current total outstanding debt facilities as of the date of this report.\nIn July 2024, the Company entered into a $150 million amortizing warehouse agreement backed by a\nportion of its finance receivables. The warehousefacility accrues interest at a rate of SOFR plus 350 basis points,\nwith payments of principal and interest due monthly and ascheduled maturity date of July 12, 2026. The company\nprimarily plans to use the funds from the warehouse facility to pay down the current revolving loan balance. The\nCompany believes it will have adequate liquidity to continue to grow its revenues and satisfy its capital needs for\nthe foreseeable future.\n37\nThe Company has two standby letters of credit relating to insurance policies totaling $3.9 millionat April\n30, 2024.\nOther than its letters of credit, the Company is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangement that\nmanagement believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition,\nrevenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to\ninvestors.\nCar-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial do not meet the affiliation standard for filing consolidated income tax\nreturns, and as such they file separate federal and state income tax returns.Car-Mart of Arkansas routinely sells its\nfinance receivables to Colonial at what the Company believes to be fair market value and is able to take a tax\ndeduction at the time of sale for the difference between the tax basis of the receivables sold and the sales price.\nThese types of transactions, based upon facts and circumstances, have been permissible under the provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code as described in the Treasury Regulations. For financial accounting purposes, these\ntransactions are eliminated in consolidation and a deferred income tax liability has been recorded for this timing\ndifference.The sale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial provides certain legal protection\nfor the Company’s finance receivables and, principally because of certain state apportionment characteristics of\nColonial, also has the effect of reducing the Company’s overall effective state income tax rate. The actual\ninterpretation of the Regulations is in part a facts and circumstances matter.The Company believes it satisfies the\nmaterial provisions of the Regulations. Failure to satisfy those provisions could result in the loss of a tax deduction\nat the time the receivables are sold and have the effect of increasing the Company’s overall effective income tax\nrate as well as the timing of required tax payments.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest\nexpense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company had no accrued penalties or interest as of April 30,\n2024.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions in determining\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from the Company’s estimates. The Company believes the most significant estimate made in the\npreparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 relates to the determination of its allowance for\ncredit losses, which is discussed below. The Company’s accounting policies are discussed in Note B to the\nConsolidated Financial Statementsin Item 8.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at a level it considers sufficient\nto cover estimated losses expected to be incurred on the portfolio at the measurement date in the collection of its\nfinance receivablescurrently outstanding.At April 30, 2024, the weighted average contract term was 47.9months\nwith 36.1 months remaining. The allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2024 of $331.3 million, was 25.32% of\nthe principal balance in finance receivables of $1.4 billion, less unearned accident protectionplan revenue of $51.8\nmillion, unearned service contract revenue of $68.9millionand,pending APP claims of $6.4million. The Company\nincreased the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables from 23.91% at April 30, 2023 to\n25.32% at April 30, 2024.\n38\nThe allowance for credit losses represents the Company’s expectation of future net charge-offs at the\nmeasurement date. The allowance takes into account quantitative and qualitative factors such as historical credit\nloss experience, with consideration given to changes in contract characteristics (i.e., average amount financed,\ngreater than 30-day delinquencies, term, and interest rates), credit quality trends, collateral values, current and\nforecasted inflationary economic conditions, underwriting and collection practices, concentration risk, credit\nreview, and other external factors. The allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by management\nwith any changes reflected in current operations.\nThe allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate for the following reasons:\nestimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require management to project future loan\nperformance, including cash flows, prepayments, and charge-offs;\nthe allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of management’s control such as industry\nand business trends, geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic\nconditions including, but not limited to, inflation; and\njudgment is required to determine whether the model used to generate the allowance for credit losses\nproduces results that appropriately reflect a current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses.\nBecause management’s estimate of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of qualitative\njudgment, such as the subjectivity of the assumptions used, there is uncertainty inherent in such estimates. Changes\nin these estimates could significantly impact the allowance and provision for credit losses.\nOccasionally, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies which the Company will adoptas of the specified effective date. Unless\notherwise discussed, the Company believes the implementation of recently issued standards which are not yet\neffective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board(“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. The guidance changes the methodology for measuring\ncredit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. This guidance will affect the\nCompany’s vintage disclosures related to current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing\nreceivables. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The\nCompany adopted this standard on May 1, 2023, under a prospective basis. In regard to installment sale contract\nmodifications, management notes that the Company primarily modifies a customer’s installment sale contract to\nallow for insignificant payment delays. This type of modification is generally done to account for payday changes\nfor the customer and minor vehicle repairs.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement (ASU 2023-06) related to disclosure or\npresentation requirements for various subtopics in the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“Codification”).\nThe amendments in the update are intended to align the requirements in the Codification with the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission's (“SEC”) regulations and facilitate the application of GAAP for all entities. The\neffective date for each amendment is the date on which the SEC removal of the related disclosure requirement from\nRegulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, or if the SEC has not removed the requirements by June 30,\n2027, this amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective for any entity. Early\nadoption is prohibited. We do not expect this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement (ASU 2023-09) related to income tax\ndisclosures. The amendments in this update are intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of\nincome tax disclosures primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This\nupdate is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. We\n39\nplan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning May 1, 2025, and we do not expect it to have a\nmaterial effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial information determined by methods other than in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We present debt, net of cash, and an adjusted\ndebt to finance receivables ratio, each a non-GAAP financial measure, as supplemental measures of our financial\ncondition. Debt, net of cash, is defined as total debt minus total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the\nbalance sheet. The adjusted debt to finance receivables ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt, net of total cash,\ncash equivalents, and restricted cash divided by the outstanding principal balance of our finance receivables. We\nbelieve debt, net of cash,and the adjusted debt to financereceivablesratio are useful measuresto monitor leverage\nand evaluate balance sheet risk. Thesemeasures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for reported\nGAAP results because they exclude certain items as compared to similar GAAP-based measures, and such measures\nmay not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. We strongly encourage investors\nto review our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in their entirety and\nnot rely solely on anyone, single financial measure. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to\nthe most directly comparable GAAPfinancial measures as of April 30, 2024, are provided in the table below.\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nDebt:\nRevolving lines of credit, net $ 200,819 $ 167,231\nNon-recourse notes payable, net 553,629 471,367\nTotal debt $ 754,448 $ 638,598\nCash:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,522 $ 9,796\nRestricted cash from collections on auto finance receivables 88,925 58,238\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 94,447 $ 68,034\nDebt, net of total cash $ 660,001 $ 570,564\nPrincipal balance of finance receivables $ 1,435,388 $ 1,373,372\nRatio of debt to finance receivables 52.6% 46.5%\nRatio of debt, net of total cash, to finance receivables 46.0% 41.5%\nThe Company is exposed to market risk on its financial instruments from changes in interest rates. In\nparticular, the Company has historically had exposure to changes in the federal primary credit rate and changes in\nthe prime interest rate of its lender.The Company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes but has\nin the past utilizedan interest rate swap agreement to manage interest rate risk.\nInterest rate risk. The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt\nobligations. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its revolving credit facilities, and the\ninterest rates charged to the Company under its credit facilities fluctuate based on its primary lender’s baserate of\ninterest.The Company had an outstanding balance on its revolving line of credit of $200.8millionat April 30, 2024\nand $167.2 million at April 30, 2023. The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates would resultin increased annual\ninterest expense of approximately $2.0million and $1.7 million based on the amounts outstanding at April 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively, and a corresponding decrease in net income before income tax.\n40\nThe Company’s earnings are impacted by its net interest income, which is the difference between the\nincome earned on interest-bearing assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing notes payable. During the third\nquarter of fiscal 2024, the Company increased the interest rate by 0.25%. The Company’s finance receivables now\ncarry a fixed annual interest rate of 18.25% (up from 18.0% at April 30, 2023) for all states, except Arkansas at\n16.75% (which is subject to a usury cap of 17.0%), Illinois (originatesat 19.5% –21.5%), and acquired dealerships\nin Tennessee (which originate at up to 23.0%), based on the Company’s contract interest rate as of the contract\norigination date, while its revolving credit facilities contain variable interest rates that fluctuate with market interest\nrates.\nThe following financial statements and accountant’s report are included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID Number 248)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of April 30, 2024 and 2023\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Equity for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n41\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nAmerica’s Car-Mart, Inc.\nOpinion on the financial statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America’s Car-Mart, Inc. (a Texas corporation)\nand subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations,\ncash flows, and equity for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2024, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2024, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated July 15, 2024 expressed an unqualified\nopinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S.federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for credit losses\nAs described further in Notes B and C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded an allowance\nfor credit losses of $331.3 million on finance receivables of $1.4 billion as of April 30, 2024. Management estimates\nthe allowance for creditlosses on finance receivables by performing an undiscounted cash flow model adjusted by\na prepayment rate. A loss-rate using historical credit loss experience (both timing and severity of losses) and\ncollateral values is then applied to the amortized costbasis of the finance receivables. The estimate is adjusted for\nconditions which include factors such as adjustments for changes in underwriting, customer credit deterioration and\ncustomer delinquency rates. The estimate is further adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts for the\nexpected effects of macroeconomic factors, such as the effects of current and forecasted inflation. We identified\nthe allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are\nthe significant judgements made by management in adjusting the historical loss experience to reflect current\n42\nconditions and the selection and measurement of factors to account for the reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod. Evaluating management’s conclusion involved a high degree of auditor judgement in performing our audit\nprocedures.\nOur audit procedures related to the allowance for credit losses included the following, among others:\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of management’s review control over the allowance for\ncredit losses, which included the selection and measurement of adjustments related to changes in\nunderwriting, customer credit deterioration, customer delinquency rates as well as the expected effects\nfrom current and forecasted inflation, on the allowance for credit losses.\nWe tested management’s process for determining the allowance for credit losses, which included the\nselection and measurement of adjustments related to underwriting, customer credit deterioration, customer\ndelinquency rates as well as the expected effects from current and forecasted inflation on the allowance for\ncredit losses.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1999.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nJuly 15, 2024\n43\n(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,522 $ 9,796\nRestricted cash 88,925 58,238\nAccrued interest on finance receivables 6,907 6,115\nFinance receivables, net 1,098,591 1,063,460\nInventory 107,470 109,290\nIncome taxes receivable, net 2,958 9,259\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 31,276 26,039\nRight-of-use asset 61,185 59,142\nGoodwill 14,449 11,716\nProperty and equipment, net 60,361 61,682\nTotal Assets $ 1,477,644 $ 1,414,737\nLiabilities, mezzanine equity and equity:\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 21,379 $ 27,196\nDeferred accident protection plan revenue 51,836 53,065\nDeferred service contract revenue 68,945 67,404\nAccrued liabilities 27,828 27,912\nDeferred income tax liabilities, net 17,808 39,315\nLease liability 64,250 62,300\nNon-recourse notes payable, net 553,629 471,367\nRevolving line of credit, net 200,819 167,231\nTotal liabilities 1,006,494 915,790\nCommitments and contingencies (Note L)\nMezzanine equity:\nMandatorily redeemable preferred stock 400 400\nEquity:\nPreferred stock, par value $.01 per share, 1,000,000 shares authorized;\nnone issued or outstanding -

References to the Company typically include the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries. The\nCompany’s operations are conducted principallythrough its two operating subsidiaries, America’s Car Mart, Inc.,\nan Arkansas corporation (“Car-Mart of Arkansas”), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation\n(“Colonial”).Collectively, Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial are referred to herein as “Car-Mart”. The Company\nprimarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers. Many of the\nCompany’s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result\nof limited credit histories or past credit difficulties. As of April 30, 2024, the Company operated 154 dealerships\nlocated primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of America’s Car-Mart, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nSegment Information\nEach dealership is an operating segment with its results regularly reviewed by the Company’s Head of\nOperations in an effort to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its\nperformance. Individual dealerships meet the aggregation criteria for reporting purposes under the current\naccounting guidance. The Company operates in the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance segment of the used car\nmarket, also referred to as the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance industry. In this industry, the nature of the sale\nand the financing of the transaction, financing processes, the type of customer and the methods used to distribute\nthe Company’s products and services, including the actual servicing of the contracts as well as the regulatory\nenvironment in which the Company operates, all have similar characteristics.Each individual dealership is similar\nin nature and only engages in the selling and financing of used vehicles. All individual dealerships have similar\noperating characteristics. As such, individual dealerships have been aggregated into one reportable segment.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates include, but are not limited to, the Company’s allowance for credit losses.\nConcentration of Risk\nThe Company provides financing in connection with the sale of substantially all of its vehicles.These sales\nare made primarily to customers residing in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri,\nOklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas, with approximately 27% of revenues resulting from sales to Arkansas customers.\nAs of April 30, 2024, and periodically throughout the year, the Company maintained cash in financial\ninstitutions in excess of the amounts insured by the federal government. The cash is held in several highly rated\nbanking institutions. The Companyregularly monitors itscounterparty credit risk and mitigates exposure by amount\nit invests in one institution.\n48\nRestrictions on Distributions/Dividends\nThe Company’s revolving credit facilities generally restrict distributions by the Company to its\nshareholders. The distribution limitations under the credit facilities allow the Company to repurchase the\nCompany’s stock so long as either: (a) the aggregate amount of such repurchases after September 30, 2021 does\nnot exceed $50 million, net of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, and the total availability under\nthe credit facilities is equal to or greater than 20% of the sum of the borrowing bases, in each case after giving effect\nto such repurchases (repurchases under this item are excluded from fixed charges for covenant calculations), or (b)\nthe aggregate amount of such repurchases does not exceed 75% of the consolidated net income of the Company\nmeasured on a trailing twelve month basis; provided that immediately before and after giving effect to the stock\nrepurchases, at least 12.5% of the aggregate funds committed under the credit facilities remain available. Thus,\nalthough the Company does routinely repurchase stock, the Company is limited in its ability to pay dividends or\nmake other distributions to its shareholders without the consent of the Company’s lenders.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities of three\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash is related to the financing and securitization transaction discussed below and are held by\nthe securitization trusts.\nRestricted cash from collections on auto finance receivables includes collections of principal, interest, and\nlate fee payments on auto finance receivables that are restricted for payment to holders of non-recourse notes\npayable pursuant to the applicable agreements.\nThe restricted cash on deposit in reserve accounts is for the benefit of holders of non-recourse notes payable\nand these funds are not expected to be available to the Company or its creditors. If the cash generated by the related\nreceivables in a given period was insufficient to pay the interest, principal, and other required payments, the balances\non deposit in the reserve accounts would be used to pay those amounts.\nRestricted cash consists of the following for the years ending April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023:\n(In thousands) April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nRestricted cash from collections on auto finance receivables $ 43,956 $ 34,442\nRestricted cash on deposit in reserve accounts 44,969 23,796\nRestricted Cash $ 88,925 $ 58,238\nFinancing and Securitization Transactions\nThe Company utilizes term securitizations to provide long-term funding for a portion of the auto finance\nreceivables initially funded through the debt facilities. In these transactions, a pool of auto finance receivables is\nsold to a special purpose entity that, in turn, transfers the receivablesto a special purpose securitization trust. The\nsecuritization trust issues asset-backed securities, secured or otherwise supported by the transferred receivables, and\nthe proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are used to finance the securitized receivables.\nThe Company is required to evaluate term securitization trusts for consolidation. In the Company’s role as\nservicer, it has the power to direct the activities of the trust that most significantly impact the economic performance\nof the trust. In addition, the obligation to absorb losses (subject to limitations) and the rights to receive any returns\n49\nof the trust, remain with the Company. Accordingly, the Company is the primary beneficiary of the trusts and is\nrequired to consolidate them.\nThe Company recognizes transfers of auto finance receivables into the term securitization as secured\nborrowings, which result in recording the auto finance receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on\nour consolidated balance sheet. These auto finance receivables can only be used as collateral to settle obligations\nof the related non-recourse notes payable. The term securitization investors have no recourse to the Company’s\nassets beyond the related auto finance receivables, the amounts on deposit in the reserve account,and the restricted\ncash from collections on auto finance receivables. See Notes C and F for additional information on auto finance\nreceivables and non-recourse notes payable.\nFinance Receivables, Repossessions and Charge-offs and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company originates installment sale contracts from the sale of used vehicles at its dealerships. These\ninstallment sale contracts carry a weighted average interest rate of approximately 16.9% using the simple effective\ninterest method including any deferred fees.During the third quarterof the 2024 fiscal year, the Company changed\nthe interest rate on new originations of installment sale contracts to 18.25% (from 18.0%) in all states except\nArkansas (originates at 16.75%), Illinois (originates at 19.5% – 21.5%) and acquired dealerships in Tennessee\n(which originate at up to 23.0%). Contract origination costs are not significant. The installment sale contracts are\nstructured to have variable paymentswhereby borrowers are obligated to pay back principal plus the full amount of\ninterest that will accrue over the entire term of the contract.Finance receivables are collateralized by vehicles sold\nand consist of contractually scheduled payments from installment contracts net of unearned finance charges and an\nallowance for credit losses.Unearned finance chargesto be collectedrepresent the balance of interest receivable to\nbe earned over the remainingterm of the related installment contract, and as such, have been reflected as a reduction\nto the gross contract amount in arriving at the principal balance in finance receivables.Totalearnedfinance charges\nwere $6.9 million and $6.1million at April 30, 2024and April 30, 2023, respectively,on the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nAn account is considered delinquent when the customer is one day or more behind on their contractual\npayments. While the Company does not formally place contracts on nonaccrual status, the immaterial amount of\ninterest that may accrue after an account becomes delinquent up until the point of resolution via repossession or\nwrite-off, is reserved for against the accrued interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Delinquent contractsare\naddressed and either made current by the customer, which is the case in most situations, or the vehicle is repossessed\nor written off if the collateral cannot be recovered quickly. Customer payments are set to match their payday with\napproximately 78.3% of payments due on either a weekly or bi-weekly basis. The frequency of the payment due\ndates combined with the general decline in the value of the collateral lead to prompt resolutions on problem\naccounts. At April 30, 2024, 3.1% of the Company’s finance receivables balances were 30 days or more past due\ncompared to 3.6% at April 30, 2023.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s automobile contracts involve contracts made to individuals with\nimpaired or limited credit histories, or higher debt-to-income ratios than permitted by traditional lenders.Contracts\nmade with buyers who are restricted in their ability to obtain financing from traditional lenders generally entail a\nhigher risk of delinquency, default and repossession, and higher losses than contracts made with buyers with better\ncredit.At the time of originating a finance agreement, the Company requires customers to meet certain criteria that\ndemonstrate their intent and ability to pay for the financed principaland interest on the vehicle they are purchasing.\nHowever, the Company recognizes that their customer base is at a higher risk of default given their impaired or\nlimited credit histories.\nThe Company strives to keep its delinquency percentages low, and not to repossess vehicles. Accounts one\nto three days late are contacted by telephone or text messaging notifications. Notes from each contact are\nelectronically maintained in the Company’s computer system. The Company also utilizes text messaging\nnotifications thatallows customers the option toreceive due date reminders and late notifications, if applicable. The\nCompany attempts to resolve payment delinquencies amicably prior to repossessing a vehicle. If a customer\n50\nbecomes severely delinquent in his or her payments, and management determines that timely collection of future\npayments is not probable, the Company will take steps to repossess the vehicle.\nPeriodically, the Company enters into contract modifications with its customers to extend or modify the\npayment terms. The Company only enters into a contract modification or extension if it believes such action will\nincrease the amount of moneythe Company will ultimately realize on the customer’s accountand will increase the\nlikelihood of the customer being able to pay off the vehicle contract. At the time of modification, the Company\nexpects to collect amounts due including accrued interest at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay. No\nother concessions are granted to customers, beyond the extension of additional time, at the time of modifications.\nModifications are minor and are made for payday changes, minor vehicle repairs and other reasons. For those\nvehicles that are repossessed, the majority are returned or surrendered by the customer on a voluntary basis.Other\nrepossessions are performed by Company personnel or third-partyrepossession agents.Depending on the condition\nof a repossessed vehicle, it is either resold on a retail basis through a Company dealership or sold for cash on a\nwholesale basis primarily through physical or online auctions.\nThe Company takes steps to repossess a vehicle when the customer becomes delinquent in his or her\npayments and management determines that timely collection of future payments is not probable. Accounts are\ncharged-off after the expiration of a statutory notice period for repossessed accounts, or when management\ndetermines that the timely collection of future payments is not probable for accounts where the Company has been\nunable to repossess the vehicle. For accounts with respect to which the vehicle was repossessed, the fair value of\nthe repossessed vehicle is charged as a reduction of the gross finance receivablesbalance charged-off.On average,\naccounts are approximately 70days past due at the time of charge-off.For previously charged-off accounts that are\nsubsequently recovered, the amount of such recovery is credited to the allowance for credit losses.\nDuring the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, the Company implemented third-party software to assist\nin calculating the Company’s allowance for credit losses. After implementation, the Company’s quantitative portion\nof the allowance for credit losses was measured using an undiscounted cash flow (“CF”) model. Whereby the\nundiscounted cash flows are adjusted by a prepayment rate and then the loss rate is applied and compared to the\namortized cost basis of finance receivables to reflect management’s estimate of expected credit losses. The CF\nmodel is based on installment sale contract level characteristics of the Company’s finance receivables, such as the\ncontractual payment structure, maturity date, payment frequency for recurring payments, and interest rates, as well\nas the following assumptions:\na historical loss period, which represents a full economic credit cycle utilizing loss experience, to\ncalculate the historical loss rate; and\nstatic annualized historical rate based on average time of charge-off; and\nexpected prepayment rates based on our historical experience, which also incorporates non-standard\ncontractual payments such as down payments made during the first ninety-days or annual seasonal\npayments.\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses also considers qualitative factors not captured within the CF\nmodeled results such as changes in underwriting and collection practices, economic trends, changes in volume and\nterms of installment sales contracts, credit quality trends, installment sale contract review results, collateral trends,\nand concentrations of credit. The Company’s qualitative factors incorporate a macroeconomic variable forecast of\ninflation over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year that affects its customers’ non-discretionary\nincome and ability to repay. The reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year is based on management’s\ncurrent review of the reliability of extended forecasts and is applied as an adjustment to the historical loss rate.\nAs a result of this update to our methodology and the performance of our loan portfolio, the Company\nincreased the provision for credit losses by $28.0 million and decreased net income by $21.8 million, or basic per\nshare loss of $3.40 per share, upon implementation of the third-party software on our condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations during the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year and had no effect on periods prior to this.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company decreased the allowance for credit loss from 26.04% to\n25.74%, resulting in a $3.9 million benefit to the provision. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the\n51\nCompany decreased the allowance for credit loss from 25.74% to 25.32%, resulting in a $5.4millionbenefit to the\nprovision. The decrease in the third and fourth quarters of the 2024 fiscal year were primarily driven by the lower\noverall inflationary outlook,fewer past due balances at third quarter end,changes in the underwriting process and\nrefinements to the underwriting guidelines due to the implementation of the Company’s new loan origination\nsystem.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on an aggregate basis at an amount it considers\nsufficient to cover net credit losses expected over the remaining life of the installment sales contracts in the portfolio\nat the measurement date. At April 30, 2024, the weighted average total contract term was 47.9 months, with 36.1\nmonths remaining. The allowance for credit losses at April 30, 2024, $331.3million, was 25.32% of the principal\nbalance in finance receivables of $1.4 billion, less deferred APP revenue of $51.8 million and deferred service\ncontract revenue of $68.9 million, less pending APP claims of $6.4 million. The allowance for credit losses is\nperiodically reviewed by management with any changes reflected in current operations.\nIn most states, the Company offers retail customers who finance their vehicle the option of purchasing an\naccident protectionplan product as an add-on to the installment sale contract.This product contractually obligates\nthe Company to cancel the remaining principal outstanding for any contract where the retail customer has totaled\nthe vehicle, as defined by the product, or the vehicle has been stolen. The Company periodically evaluates\nanticipated losses to ensure that if anticipated losses exceed deferred accident protection plan revenues, an\nadditional liability is recorded for such a difference. At April 30, 2024,anticipated losses did not exceed deferred\naccident protection plan revenues. No such liability was required at April 30, 2024 or 2023.\nInventory\nInventory consists of used vehicles and is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a specific\nidentification basis.Vehicle reconditioning costs are capitalized as a component of inventory.Repossessed vehicles\nand trade-in vehicles are recorded at fair value, which approximates wholesale value.The cost of used vehicles sold\nis determined using the specific identification method.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill reflects the excess of purchase price over the fair value of specifically identified net assets\npurchased. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to\nqualitative annual impairment tests at the Company’s year-end. The impairment tests are based on the comparison\nof the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of such unit. The implied goodwill is compared to the\ncarrying value of the goodwill to determine the impairment, if any. There was no impairment of goodwill during\nthe 2023 fiscal year.During the 2024 fiscal year, the Company evaluated goodwill and recorded an impairment of\n$267,000 due to the closing of a dealership during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nThe Company had $14.4 million and $11.7 million of goodwill for the periods ended April 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Goodwill increased by $2.7 million during the year ended April 30, 2024 due to the acquisition\nof a dealership business during the current year, which was partially offset by the impairment mentioned above.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions, remodels and improvements are\ncapitalized. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized\nover the shorter of the estimated life of the improvement or the lease period.The lease period includes the primary\nlease term plus any extensions that are reasonably assured.Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-\nline method generally over the following estimated useful lives:\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 3 to 7 years\nLeasehold improvements 5 to 15 years\nBuildings and improvements 18 to 39 years\n52\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment, capitalized internal-use software and operating lease\nright-of-use assetsare reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable.If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for\npossible impairment, the Company first compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that\nasset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable\non an undiscounted cash flow basis, such assets are considered to beimpaired, and the impairmentis recognized to\nthe extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. There were no impairment charges recognized during any\nof the periods presented.\nCloud Computing Implementation Costs\nThe Company enters into cloud computing service contracts to support its sales, inventory management,\nand administrative activities. The Company capitalizes certain implementation costs for cloud computing\narrangements that meet the definition of a service contract. The Company includes these capitalized implementation\ncosts within Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once placed in service, the\nCompany amortizes these costs over the remaining subscription term to the same caption on the Consolidated\nStatement of Operations as the related cloud subscription. Capitalized implementation costs for cloud computing\narrangements accounted for as service contracts were $16.7 million and $10.8 million as of April 30, 2024, and\n2023, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized implementation costs for these arrangements was\n$339,500 and $136,709 as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCash Overdraft\nAs checks are presented for paymentfrom the Company’s primary disbursement bank account, monies are\nautomatically drawn against cash collections for the day and, if necessary, are drawn against one of its revolving\ncredit facilities.Anycash overdraft balance principally represents outstanding checks, net of any deposits in transit\nthat as of the balance sheet date had not yet been presented for payment. Any cash overdraft balance is reflected in\naccrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeferred Sales Tax\nDeferred sales tax represents a sales tax liability of the Company for vehicles sold on an installment basis\nin the states of Alabama and Texas. Under Alabama and Texas law, for vehicles sold on an installment basis, the\nrelated sales tax is due as the payments are collected from the customer, rather than at the time of sale. Deferred\nsales tax liabilities are reflected in accrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets\nand liabilities are determined based on differencesbetween financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities\nand are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which these differences are expected\nto be recovered or settled.\nOccasionally, the Company is audited by taxing authorities. These audits could result in proposed\nassessments of additional taxes. The Company believes that its tax positions comply in all material respects with\napplicable tax law; however, tax law is subject to interpretation, and interpretations by taxing authorities could be\ndifferent from those of the Company, which could result in the imposition of additional taxes.\nThe Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the\nrelevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting\nthe more likely than not threshold,the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has\n53\na greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.The\nCompany applies this methodology to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remains open.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions.Tax\nregulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and\nrequire significant judgment to apply.With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state\nand local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the fiscal years before 2020.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest\nexpense and penalties in operating expenses. The Company had no accrued penalties or interest as of April 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are generated principally from the sale of used vehicles, which in most cases includes a service\ncontract and an accident protection plan product, as well as interest income and late fees earned on finance\nreceivables. Revenues are net of taxes collected from customers and remitted to government agencies. Cost of\nvehicle sales include costs incurred by the Company to prepare the vehicle for sale including license and title costs,\ngasoline, transport services and repairs.\nRevenues from the sale of used vehicles are recognized when the sales contract is signed, the customer has\ntaken possession of the vehicle and, if applicable, financing has been approved.Revenues from the sale of vehicles\nsold at wholesale are recognized at the time the proceeds are received.Revenues from the sale of service contracts\nare recognized ratably over the expected duration of the product. Service contract revenues are included in sales\nand the related expenses are included in cost of sales. Accident protection plan revenuesare initially deferred and\nthen recognized to income using the “Rule of 78’s” interest method over the life of the contractso that revenues are\nrecognized in proportion to the amount of cancellation protection provided.Accident protection plan revenues are\nincluded in sales and related losses are included in cost of sales as incurred. Interest income is recognized on all\nactive finance receivables accounts using the simple effective interest method.Active accounts include all accounts\nexcept those that have been paid-off or charged-off.\nSales consist of the following for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended April 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nSales –used autos $ 1,003,640 $ 1,057,465 $ 918,414\nWholesales –third party 52,463 54,610 46,625\nService contract sales 67,213 57,593 42,958\nAccident protection plan revenue 37,482 34,526 30,685\nTotal $ 1,160,798 $ 1,204,194 $ 1,038,682\nAt April 30, 2024 and 2023, finance receivables more than 90 days past due were approximately $4.5\nmillionand $3.9 million, respectively. Late fee revenues totaled approximately $4.9million, $4.4 million, and $3.1\nmillionfor the fiscal years ended 2024, 2023, and 2022,respectively. Late fee revenue is recognized when collected\nand is reflected within Interest and other income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDuring the years ended April 30, 2024and 2023, the Company recognized $34.8 million and $26.8 million\nof revenues that were included in deferred service contract revenues for the years ended April 30, 2023and 2022,\nrespectively.\n54\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and consist principally of television, radio, print media and\ndigital marketing costs. Advertising costs amounted to $4.3 million, $5.8 million and $5.0 million for the years\nended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has 401(k) plans for all of its employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.The plans\nprovide for voluntary employee contributions and the Company matches 50% of employee contributions up to a\nmaximum of 6% of each employee’s compensation. The Company contributed approximately $1.1 million, $1.2\nmillion, and $1.2 million to the plans for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company offers employees the right to purchase common shares at a 15% discount from market price\nunder the 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which was approved by shareholders in October 2006. The Company\ntakes a charge to earnings for the 15% discount, included in stock-based compensation. Amounts for fiscal years\n2024, 2023 and 2022 were not materialindividually orin the aggregate.A total of 200,000 shares were registered\nand 125,149 remain available for issuance under this plan at April 30, 2024.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the\naverage number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by\ndividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period plus dilutive common stock equivalents.The calculation of diluted earnings per share takes into\nconsideration the potentially dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, such as outstanding stock options and\nnon-vested restricted stock, which if exercised or converted into common stock would then share in the earnings of\nthe Company. In computing diluted earnings per share, the Company utilizes the treasury stock method and anti-\ndilutive securities are excluded.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity\ninstruments, such as stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant\nover the requisite service period.The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair\nvalue of stock option awards.The Company may issue either new shares or treasury shares upon exercise of these\nawards. Stock-based compensation plans, related expenses, and assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option\npricing model are more fully described in Note K. If an award contains a performance condition, expense is\nrecognized only for those shares for which it is considered reasonably probable as of the current period end that the\nperformance condition will be met.The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur and records any excess tax\nbenefits or deficiencies from equity awards in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting period in\nwhich the exercises occur. The Company recorded a discrete income tax benefit of approximately $227,000 and\n$558,000 during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As a result, the Company’s income tax\nexpenses and associated effective tax rate will be impacted by fluctuations in stock price between the grant dates\nand exercise dates of equity awards.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company purchased 4,274, 57,856, and 304,204 shares of its common stock to be held as treasury\nstock for a total cost of $365,000, $5.2 million, $34.7millionduring the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Treasury stock may be used for issuances under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans or\nfor other general corporate purposes. The Company has a reserve account of 10,000 shares of treasury stock to\nsecure outstanding service contracts issued in Iowa in accordance with the regulatory requirements of that state and\n55\nanother reserve account of 14,000 shares of treasury stock for its subsidiary, ACM Insurance Company, in\naccordance with the requirements of the Arkansas Department of Insurance.\nFacility Leases\nThe Company’s leases primarily consist of operating leases related to retail stores, office space, and land.\nFor more information on financing obligations, see Note F.\nThe initial term for real property leases is typically 3 to 10 years. Most leases include one or more options\nto renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 3 to 10 years or more. The Company includes\noptions to renew (or terminate) in the lease term, and as part of the right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability,\nwhen it is reasonably certain that the options will be exercised. The weighted average remaining lease term as of\nApril 30, 2024 was 11.4 years.\nThe ROU asset and the related lease liability are initially measured at the present value of future lease\npayments over the lease term. As most leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company obtains a quote\nfor a collateralized debt obligation from a group of lenders each quarter to determine the present value of future\npayments of leases commenced for that quarter. The weighted average discount rate as of April 30, 2024 was 4.6%.\nThe Company includes variable lease payments in the initial measurement of ROU assets and lease\nliabilities only to the extent they depend on an index or rate. Changes in such indices or rates are accounted for in\nthe period the change occurs, and do not result in the remeasurement of the ROU asset or liability. The Company\nis also responsible for payment of certain real estate taxes, insurance, and other expenses on leases. These amounts\nare generally considered to be variable and are not included in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability.\nNon-lease components are generally accounted for separately from lease components. The Company’s leases do\nnot contain any material residual value guarantees or material restricted covenants.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOccasionally, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies which the Company will adopt as of the specified effective date. Unless\notherwise discussed, the Company believes the implementation of recently issued standards which are not yet\neffective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn March 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board(“FASB”)issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. The guidance changes the methodology for measuring\ncredit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. This guidance will affect the\nCompany’s vintage disclosures related to current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing\nreceivables. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The\nCompany adopted this standard on May 1, 2023 under a prospective basis. In regard to installment sale contract\nmodifications, management notes that the Company primarily modifies a customer’s installment sale contract to\nallow for insignificant payment delays. This type of modification is generally done to account for payday changes\nfor the customer and minor vehicle repairs.\nIn October 2023, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement (ASU 2023-06) related to disclosure or\npresentation requirements for various subtopics in the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (“Codification”).\nThe amendments in the update are intended to align the requirements in the Codification with the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission's (“SEC”) regulations and facilitate the application of GAAP for all entities. The\neffective date for each amendment is the date on which the SEC removal of the related disclosure requirement from\nRegulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, or if the SEC has not removed the requirements by June 30,\n2027, this amendment will be removed from the Codification and will not become effective for any entity. Early\nadoption is prohibited. We do not expect this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n56\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting pronouncement (ASU 2023-09) related to income tax\ndisclosures. The amendments in this update are intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of\nincome tax disclosures primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This\nupdate is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. We\nplan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning May 1, 2025, and we do not expect it to have a\nmaterial effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company originates installment sale contracts from the sale of used vehicles at its dealerships. These\ninstallment sale contracts, which carry a fixed interest rate of 18.25% for all states except Arkansas (originates at\n16.75%), Illinois (originates at 19.5% - 21.5%) and acquired dealerships in Tennessee (which originate at up to\n23.0%), are collateralized by the vehicle sold and typically provide for payments over periods ranging from 18 to\n69 months. The Company’s finance receivables are defined as one segment and one class of loans, which is sub-\nprime consumer automobile contracts. The level of risks in our financing receivables is managed as one\nhomogeneous pool. The components of finance receivables as of April 30, 2024, and 2023 are as follows:\n(In thousands) April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nGross contract amount $ 1,844,392 $ 1,752,149\nLess unearned finance charges (409,004) (378,777)\nPrincipal balance 1,435,388 1,373,372\nLess: estimated insurance receivables for APP claims (3,026) (5,694)\nLess: allowance for APP claims (3,171) (5,310)\nLess: allowance for credit losses (331,260) (299,608)\nFinance receivables, net 1,097,931 1,062,760\nLoan origination costs 660 700\nFinance receivables, net, including loan origination costs 1,098,591 1,063,460\nAuto finance receivables collateralizing the non-recourse notes payable related to the financing and\nsecuritization transaction completed during the fiscal year 2024 and 2023 were $814.7 million and $721.9 million,\nrespectively.\nChanges in the finance receivables, net for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nYears Ended April 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 1,062,760 $ 855,424 $ 626,077\nFinance receivable originations 1,079,946 1,161,132 1,009,859\nFinance receivable collections (455,828) (434,458) (417,796)\nProvision for credit losses (423,406) (352,860) (238,054)\nLosses on claims for accident protection plan (34,504) (25,107) (21,871)\nInventory acquired in repossession and accident protection plan claims (131,037) (141,371) (102,791)\nBalance at end of period $ 1,097,931 $ 1,062,760 $ 855,424\n57\nChanges in the finance receivablesallowance for credit losses for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and\n2022are as follows:\nYears Ended April 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 299,608 $ 237,823 $ 177,267\nProvision for credit losses 423,406 352,860 238,054\nCharge-offs (525,634) (414,397) (260,039)\nRecovered collateral 133,880 123,322 8 2,541\nBalance at end of period $ 331,260 $ 299,608 $ 237,823\nAmounts recovered from previously written-off accounts were $2.8 million, $2.5 million, and $2.4 million\nfor the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts are netted against recovered\ncollateral in the table above.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the allowance for credit losses remained basically flat at 23.57%, up from 23.55% at\nApril 30, 2021. For fiscal 2023, credit losses increased primarily due to the ending of federal stimulus programs,\ncontinuing inflationary pressure on customers and increasing interest rates from federal monetary policy,and inthe\nfourth quarter of fiscal2023, the Companyincreased its allowance for credit losses to 23.91%. During the second\nquarter of the 2024 fiscal year, the Company increased the allowance for credit losses to 26.04%. The Company\ndecreasedthe allowance for credit losses to 25.74% and 25.32% during the third quarter and fourth quarter of fiscal\nyear 2024, respectively. The decrease in the third quarter and fourth quarter of the 2024 fiscal year was primarily\ndriven by the lower overall inflationary outlook and fewer past due balances at third quarter end and changes in the\nunderwriting process and refinements to the underwriting guidelines due to the implementation of the Company’s\nnew loan origination system.As a resultof the implementation of LOSand the new deal structuresthere has been\na notable decrease in the frequency and loss rate in charge-offs as compared to loans that were originated during\nthe same period and dealership state using the legacy system. All the underwriting deal information is centrally\nlocated in LOS and as such, dealerships can view internal scores, deal percentages, pre-qual credit report and other\ncustomer information. Historically, this information was sourced from several sources. As a result, changes to the\nunderwriting process and refinement to the underwriting guidelines, the decisions to underwrite tend to be better\ninformed.\nCredit quality information for finance receivables is as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands) April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nPrincipal Percent of Principal Percent of\nBalance Portfolio Balance Portfolio\nCurrent $ 1,125,945 78.44% $ 1,166,860 84.96%\n3 - 29 days past due 264,491 18.43% 156,943 11.43%\n30 - 60 days past due 34,042 2.37% 37,214 2.71%\n61 - 90 days past due 6,438 0.45% 8,407 0.61%\n> 90 days past due 4,472 0.31% 3,948 0.29%\nTotal $ 1,435,388 100.00% $ 1,373,372 100.00%\nAccounts one and two days past due are considered current for this analysis, due to the varying payment\ndates and variation in the day of the week at each period end. Delinquencies may vary from period to period based\non the average age of the portfolio, seasonality within the calendar year, the day of the week and overall economic\nfactors. The above categories are consistent with internal operational measures used by the Company to monitor\ncredit results.\n58\nSubstantially all of the Company’s installment sale contracts involve contracts made to individuals with\nimpaired or limited credit histories, or higher debt-to-income ratios than permitted by traditional lenders.Contracts\nmade with buyers who are restricted in their ability to obtain financing from traditional lenders generally entail a\nhigher risk of delinquency, default and repossession, and higher losses than contracts made with buyers with better\ncredit. The Company monitors customer scores, contract term length, payment to income, down payment\npercentages, and collections for credit quality indicators.\nTwelve Months Ended\nApril 30,\n2024 2023\nAverage total collected per active customer per month $ 554 $ 534\nPrincipal collected as a percent of average finance receivables 31.7% 34.7%\nAverage down-payment percentage 5.4% 5.4%\nAverage originating contract term (in months) 44.0 42.9\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nPortfolio weighted average contract term, including modifications (in months) 47.9 46.3\nAlthough total dollars collected per active customer increased 3.7% year over year, principal collections as\na percentage of average finance receivables were lower in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to the\naverage term increases. The portfolio weighted average contract term increased primarily due to the increased\naverage selling price, up $1,033 or 5.7%, from fiscal year 2023.\nWhen customers apply for financing, the Company’s proprietary scoring models rely on the customers’\ncredit histories and certain application information to evaluate and rank their risk. The Company obtains credit\nhistories and other credit data that includes information such as number of different addresses, age of oldest record,\nhigh risk credit activity, job time, time at residence and other factors. The application information that is used\nincludes income, collateral value and down payment. The scoring models yield credit grades that represent the\nrelative likelihood of repayment. Customers with the highest probability of repayment are 6 rated customers.\nCustomers assigned a lower grade are determined to have a lower probability of repayment. For loans that are\napproved, the credit grade influences the terms of the agreement, such as the maximum amount financed, term\nlength and minimum down payment. After origination, credit grades are generally not updated.\nThe following table presents a summary of finance receivables by credit quality indicator, as of April 30,\n2024 segregated by customer score and year of origination.\nCustomer Score by Fiscal Year of Origination\nPrior to\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2020 Total %\n1-2 $ 43,445 $ 13,757 $ 3,668 $ 375 $ 95 $ 6 $ 61,346 4.3%\n3-4 300,323 117,904 36,349 4,552 325 158 459,611 32.0%\n5-6 485,535 291,198 116,611 19,452 1,216 419 914,431 63.7%\nTotal $ 829,303 $ 422,859 $ 156,628 $ 24,379 $ 1,636 $ 583 $ 1,435,388 100.0%\nGross charge-offs $ 155,385 $ 265,609 $ 88,160 $ 14,835 $ 1,081 $ 564 $ 525,634\n59\nThe following table presents a summary of finance receivables by credit quality indicator, as of April 30,\n2023 segregated by customer score and year of origination.\nCustomer Score by Fiscal Year of Origination\nPrior to\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2019 Total %\n1-2 $ 38,743 $ 12,983 $ 2,736 $ 329 $ 32 $ 6 $ 54,829 4.0%\n3-4 294,972 105,101 24,982 1,698 243 137 427,133 31.1%\n5-6 563,581 254,945 66,436 5,390 687 371 891,410 64.9%\nTotal $ 897,296 $ 373,029 $ 94,154 $ 7,417 $ 962 $ 514 $ 1,373,372 100.0%\nA summary of property and equipment is as follows:\n(In thousands) April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nLand $ 11,998 $ 12,386\nBuildings and improvements 23,435 20,894\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 21,752 18,989\nLeasehold improvements 50,689 47,315\nConstruction in progress 2,393 7,176\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (49,906) (45,078)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 60,361 $ 61,682\nA summary of accrued liabilities is as follows:\n(In thousands) April 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nEmployee compensation and benefits $ 10,774 $ 11,197\nDeferred sales tax 6,234 8,543\nFair value of contingent consideration 3,193 1,943\nOther 7,627 6,229\nAccrued liabilities $ 27,828 $ 27,912\n60\nA summary of debtis as follows:\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nRevolving line of credit $ 201,743 $ 168,516\nDebt issuance costs (924) (1,285)\nRevolving line of credit, net $ 200,819 $ 167,231\nNon-recourse notes payable - 2022-1 Issuance $ - $ 134,137\nNon-recourse notes payable - 2023-1 Issuance 150,190 338,777\nNon-recourse notes payable - 2023-2 Issuance 203,189 -\nNon-recourse notes payable - 2024-1 Issuance 202,916 -\nDebt issuance costs (2,666) (1,547)\nNon-recourse notes payable, net $ 553,629 $ 471,367\nTotal debt $ 754,448 $ 638,598\nRevolving Line of Credit\nAt April 30, 2024, the Companyand its subsidiaries have$340.0million of permitted borrowings under a\nrevolving line of credit. The revolving credit facilities are collateralized primarily by finance receivables and\ninventory, are cross collateralized and contain a guarantee by the Company. Interest is payable monthly under the\nrevolving credit facilities with a scheduled maturity date of September 30, 2025. The credit facilities provide for\nfour pricing tiers for determining the applicable interest rate, based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio\nfor the preceding fiscal quarter. The current applicable interest rate under the credit facilities is generally SOFR\nplus 3.50% or for non-SOFR amounts the base rate of 8.50% plus 1% at April 30, 2024 and 8.25% at April 30,\n2023.The credit facilities contain various reporting and performance covenants including (i) maintenance of certain\nfinancial ratios and tests, (ii) limitations on borrowings from other sources, (iii) restrictions on certain operating\nactivities and (iv) restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions (see note B).\nThe Company was in compliance with the covenants at April 30, 2024. The amount available to be drawn\nunder the credit facilities is a function of eligible finance receivables and inventory; based upon eligible finance\nreceivables and inventory at April 30, 2024, the Company had additional availability of approximately $73.4 million\nunder the revolving credit facilities.\nNon-Recourse Notes Payable\nThe Company has issued four separate series of asset-backed non-recourse notes (known as the “2022\nIssuance”, “2023-1 Issuance”, “2023-2 Issuance” and “2024-1 Issuance”). All four issuances are collateralized by\ninstallment sale contracts directly originated by the Company. Credit enhancement for the non-recourse notes\npayable consists of overcollateralization, a reserve account funded with an initial amount of not less than 2.0% of\nthe pool balance, excess interest on the auto finance receivables, and in some cases, the subordination of certain\npayments to noteholders of less senior classes of notes. The timing of principal payments on the non-recourse notes\npayable is based on the timing of principal collections and defaults on the related auto finance receivables. In\nDecember 2023, the Company fully paid off the 2022 Issuance. The three notes payable related to the remaining\nterm securitization transactions accrue interest predominately at fixed rates and have scheduled maturities through\nJanuary 22, 2030, June 20, 2030, and January 21, 2031, respectively, but may mature earlier, depending upon\n61\nrepayment rate of the underlying auto finance receivables. The original principal balance and weighted average\nfixed coupon rate for the three securitizations are as follows:\nOriginal Principal Balance Weighted Average Fixed\n(in thousands) Coupon Rate\n2023-1 $ 400,200 8.68%\n2023-2 360,300 8.80%\n2024-1 250,000 9.50%\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements defines fair value,\nestablishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The guidance also\nestablishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable\ninputs when measuring fair value. Topic 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1Inputs –Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 Inputs – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nor other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially\nthe full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 Inputs – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are\nsignificant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nBecause no market exists for certain of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based\non judgments and estimates regarding yield expectations of investors, credit risk and other risk characteristics,\nincluding interest rate and prepayment risk.These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and\nmatters of judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.Changes in assumptions could significantly\naffect these estimates.\nThe methodology and assumptions utilized to estimate the fair value of the Company’s financial\ninstruments are as follows:\nFinancial Instrumentsand Valuation Methodology\nother assets\nCash, cash equivalents, and The carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of\nrestricted cash fair value due to the short-term nature of the financial instruments\n(Level 1).\nRepossessed inventory The fair value approximates wholesale value (Level 1).\nFinance receivables, net The Company estimated the fair value of its receivables at what a\nthird-party purchaser might be willing to pay. The Company has\nhad discussions with third parties and has bought and sold\nportfolios and has had a third-party appraisal in October 2022that\nindicates a range of 34% to 39% discount to face would be a\nreasonable fair value in a negotiated third-party transaction.The\nsale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial\n62\nis made at a 38.5% discount. For financial reporting purposes\nthese sale transactions are eliminated(Level 2).\nAccounts payable The carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of\nfair value due to the short-term nature of the financial instrument\n(Level 2).\nContingent Consideration The fair value was based upon inputs from the earn-out\nprojection (Level 2).\nRevolving line of credit The fair value approximates carrying value due to the variable\ninterest rates charged on the borrowings, which reprice frequently\n(Level 2).\nNon-recourse notes payable The fair value was based upon inputs derived from prices for\nsimilar instruments at period end (Level 2).\nThe estimated fair values, and related carrying amounts, of the financial instruments and other assets\nincluded in the Company’s financial statements at April 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nCarrying Fair Carrying Fair\n(In thousands) Value Value Value Value\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,522 $ 5,522 $ 9,796 $ 9,796\nRestricted cash 88,925 88,925 58,238 58,238\nInventory - Repossessions 18,182 18,182 16,451 16,451\nFinance receivables, net 1,098,591 882,764 1,063,460 844,624\nAccounts payable 21,379 21,379 27,196 27,196\nContingent Consideration 3,193 3,193 1,943 1,943\nRevolving line of credit, net 200,819 200,819 167,231 167,231\nNon-recourse notes payable 553,629 553,003 471,367 470,209\nThe provision for income taxes was as follows:\nYears Ended April 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nProvision for income taxes\nCurrent $ 12,765 $ (3,504) $ 18,871\nDeferred (21,507) 8,866 8,750\nTotal $ (8,742) $ 5,362 $ 27,621\n63\nThe provision for income taxes is different from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal\nincome tax rate to income before income taxes for the following reasons:\nYears Ended April 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nTax provision at statutory rate $ (8,428) $ 5,417 $ 25,753\nState taxes, net of federal benefit (1,204) 774 3,679\nTax benefit from option exercises (227) (558) (1,356)\nOther, net 1,117 (271) (455)\nTotal $ (8,742) $ 5,362 $ 27,621\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of\nassets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The Company does not expect the final outcome of any of these actions, individually or in the\naggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, annual results of operations or\ncash flows. The results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, however, and an unfavorable\nresolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial\nposition, annual results of operations or cash flows.\nRelated Finance Company\nCar-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial do not meet the affiliation standard for filing consolidated income tax\nreturns, and as such they file separate federal and state income tax returns.Car-Mart of Arkansas routinely sells its\nfinance receivables to Colonial at what the Company believes to be fair market value and is able to take a tax\ndeduction at the time of sale for the difference between the tax basis of the receivables sold and the sales price.\nThese types of transactions, based upon facts and circumstances, have been permissible under the provisions of the\nInternal Revenue Code as described in the Treasury Regulations. For financial accounting purposes, these\ntransactions are eliminated in consolidation, and a deferred income tax liability has been recorded for this timing\ndifference.The sale of finance receivables from Car-Mart of Arkansas to Colonial provides certain legal protection\nfor the Company’s finance receivables and, principally because of certain state apportionment characteristics of\n68\nColonial, also has the effect of reducing the Company’s overall effective state income tax rate. The actual\ninterpretation of the regulations is in part a facts and circumstances matter. The Company believes it satisfies the\nmaterial provisions of the regulations. Failure to satisfy those provisions could result in the loss of a tax deduction\nat the time the receivables are sold and have the effect of increasing the Company’s overall effective income tax\nrate as well as the timing of required tax payments.\nSupplemental cash flow disclosures for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are as follows:\nYears Ended April 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nSupplemental disclosures:\nInterest paid $ 65,647 $ 36,605 $ 10,421\nIncome taxes paid, net 6,459 5,480 19,238\nNon-cash transactions:\nInventory acquired in repossession and accident protection plan claims 137,366 127,035 84,096\nReduction in net receivables for deferred ancillary product revenue at time of charge-off 37,877 30,665 16,814\nNet settlement option exercises 1,828 223 5,685\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities 2,134 578 3,176\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities through acquisitions 1,822 1,729 -\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of the dealership assets of\nTexas Auto Center, which includes two dealership locations in Austin and San Marcos, Texas. Cash paid on the\nclosing date was $7.5 million, primarily used for vehicle inventory. The structure is consistent with prior\ntransactions whereby the Company did not acquire existing finance receivables and the sellers may receive a\nperformance-based earn-out in the future ranging from zero to a maximum of $15 million.\nIn July 2024, the Company entered into an amendment to its revolving credit agreement to allow for, among\nother things, the entry into a warehouse agreement with corporate support up to 10% of the aggregate principal\nbalance and amended the fixed charge coverage ratio. Simultaneously, the Company entered into a new warehouse\nagreement providing a $150 million amortizing warehouse facility. The company primarily plans to use the funds\nfrom the warehouse facility to pay down the current revolving loan balance.The warehouse facility accrues interest\nat a rate of SOFR plus 350 basis points, with payments of principal and interest due monthly and a scheduled\nmaturity date of July 12, 2026.\n69\nNone.\nManagement, with the participation of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chief\nFinancial Officer,has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)),\nas of April 30, 2024.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nJuly 15, 2024\n71\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company’s last fiscal quarter that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\nDuring the three months ended April 30, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers adopted or\nterminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term in defined\nin Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nNot applicable.\nExcept as to information with respect to executive officers which is contained in a separate heading under\nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the information required by Items 10 through 14 of this Form 10-K is, pursuant to\nGeneral Instruction G (3) of Form 10-K, incorporated by reference herein from the Company's definitive proxy\nstatement to be filed pursuant to Regulation 14A for the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in\nAugust 2024 (the “Proxy Statement”).The Company will, within 120 days of the end of its fiscal year, file with the\nSEC a definitive proxy statement pursuant to Regulation 14A.\nThe information required by this item will be contained in the Proxy Statement and such information is\nincorporated herein by reference.

He bought a few cars and opened the first Car-Mart in Rogers, Arkansas. When the cars sold quickly, Bill knew he was\non to something. As the business grew and Bill opened more Car-Mart dealerships, he wanted customers to know they could\nget good value for their money at Car-Mart.

We give them\npeace of mind and leave them confident they are driving a\nreliable, used vehicle with continuing support after the sale.\nMission, Vision, Values\nThese are the guiding forces behind what we strive to do each day. We start company meetings by reciting these items and\nincluding them in our training materials, classes, and posters at each dealership. It’s part of our DNA. Car-Mart associates have\na special pride for our Mission, Vision and Values.\nAlthough we have modified our Mission and Vision over the years, our four core values are the same as they were at our\nfounding in 1981. These values – Integrity, Respect, Compassion and Excellence – instill trust in all we encounter. We make a\ncommitment to providing vehicles that are accessible and affordable.

Some of these events include International Women’s\nDay, Women’s History Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Indigenous People’s Day, Hispanic Heritage\nMonth, Black History Month, and Veteran’s Day.\nAssociate Recognition\nAssociates are frequently recognized for their contributions within the\nCompany and their service to our customers. The Pacesetter Award is\npresented to any associate who goes above and beyond in their daily work.\nAll associates receive anniversary service awards at 5-year increments, and\nwe host a special celebration to recognize associates when they achieve 25\nyears of service to Car-Mart.\nGeneral Managers of dealerships are eligible to receive awards for sales,\nexcellence in account management and expense management. These are\nawarded by region. Associates are also recognized for excellent results in\nsales and collections. Annually, Car-Mart recognizes the General Manager\nand Lot of the Year, which is the highest award for a dealership. There are\nother recognitions for various levels of performance and a Mission Award\nis awarded annually to an associate who leads and embodies Car-Mart’s\nmission of earning repeat customer business. The highest award in the\nCompany, given to one associate annually, is the President’s Award for\nrecognition of an individual who embodies the Company’s values and has\nachieved remarkable success.\nSafety is Paramount for Associates and Customers\nEnsuring the safety of all associates, customers, suppliers, and guests and complying with federal, state and local safety laws and\nregulations are critical priorities for us. We are focused on equipping our managers and associates with the tools and training to do\ntheir job safely. We value the trust that our customers place in us each time they visit one of our dealerships, either to buy a vehicle,\nmake a payment or discuss their account. They rightfully expect to be safe and protected with each visit.\nOur commitment to health and safety is a priority for our associates and customers. We keep work areas clean and resolve or report\nhazards as soon as they are discovered. We work to ensure that there are safe labor conditions and health and safety practices.\nAll associates share health and safety responsibilities, from management to sales representatives. Every associate has a responsibility\nto stay informed about safety initiatives and to report unsafe conditions to their supervisor. Workplace safety, especially related to\nvehicles, requires constant discipline and focus. Suppliers also must ensure that employees working on behalf of Car-Mart adhere to\nall our health and safety policies, requirements, and regulations.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart Responsibility Report 18\nTraining &\nCont...\nDevelopment\nWe have specific annual safety goals that are reviewed by our management team:\n• Eliminate all preventable work-related injuries, illnesses and property damage;\n• Achieve 100% compliance with all established safety procedures.\nWe are committed to reducing all workplace incidents among associates and customers. Internally, we track workplace injuries among\nassociates, customers and other third parties at our facilities. With our comprehensive safety and education program and attention to\nproper procedures at our dealerships, the number of incidents is below industry standards for all retail locations.\n2023 HIGHLIGHTS:\n• Risk Manager maintained OSHA 300 certified status for workplace safety;\n• Updated our OSHA approved Company Health and Safety Plan;\n• Lot-level safety and maintenance inspections are now conducted periodically by a nationwide third-party provider specializing in\nfacilities maintenance;\n• Facilities safety and maintenance items identified during inspections are repaired through a nationwide network of approved\nthird-party providers.\nOur Risk Manager is responsible for safety education, training and regularly reviews indicators and areas where risks and injuries can\noccur, helping us to eliminate hazards. General Managers at each location are responsible for safety at their location daily. There is a\nSafety Committee at the Corporate Office, with representatives from different functional areas in the Office. Members of the Corporate\nSafety Committee are trained in CPR and other emergency procedures and help assist with an issue until emergency personnel arrive.\nThe Safety Committee at the Corporate Office regularly conducts drills for events such as a fire or tornado.\nThe Risk Manager, along with executive management, meets quarterly with the Company’s insurance provider to review claims and\ndetermine if remediation programs are required, such as slip/fall and dog bite incident training. In 2023 annual safety training was\nprovided for all associates.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors receives reports annually on insurance and risk assessments. The Company assesses\nnew risks and opportunities as they occur and ensures that they are evaluated for potential impact to associates, customers, suppliers,\nand communities.\nDriving Safely\nOperational safety is paramount throughout the organization and especially related to Company and customers’ vehicles. Every\nassociate whose job requires him or her to drive a vehicle owned by a customer must have a valid driver’s license and a driving\nrecord that is acceptable to the Company’s insurance carrier. An associate with a driving record considered below standards has an\nopportunity to improve a driving deficiency. All positions at our lots must have a valid driver’s license. Annual safe-driving training is\nrequired for all applicable job positions.\nCar-Mart’s insurance company secures a Motor Vehicle Report (MVR) prior to employment and conducts periodic checks on any\nassociate who operates a company vehicle. A change in an associate’s driving status—e.g., license suspension or a major traffic\nviolation, must be reported immediately to management. Based on the information provided by a MVR, an associate is assigned a\ngrade of insurability. Drivers with one or more of the following types of serious driving violations within the past 3 years are at risk of\nbeing uninsured and can be subject to termination of employment:\n• Driving while intoxicated or while disabled by use of drugs;\n• Refusal to submit to test for alcohol (e.g., failure to take a chemical test, blood test, or breath analyzer test);\n• Leaving the scene of an accident without reporting it;\n• Homicide, assault or criminal negligence resulting from the operation of a vehicle;\n• Driving while license is suspended or revoked;\n• Reckless or dangerous driving which results in injury to a person;\n• Racing;\n• Passing a stopped school bus;\n• Possession of a controlled substance.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart Responsibility Report 19\nTraining &\nCont... Development\nThe company’s commitment to accountability means that all driving violations, seat belt violations, and/or at fault accidents within\nthe past three years are evaluated. Associates exceeding the limits of violations or accidents based on age can longer drive a vehicle.\nThis can result in termination of employment or placement in a non-driving position. Associates under the age of 25 must maintain\na driving record of less than 2 violations and associates over 25 must maintain a driving record of less than 3 violations.\nThe Company also has detailed specific safe driving regulations for the use of a Company-owned vehicle.\nCar-Mart reminds both associates and customers:\n• Don’t drink or use drugs and drive.\n• Wear a seat belt.\n• Don’t text or talk and drive, unless it is hands-free.\nData Security & Privacy\nData security is a key component of our commitment to providing our associates and customers with a great experience. We\nhave the responsibility to protect and safeguard all information and secure the sensitive data of those who place their trust in us.\nOur Approach\nOur data security mission is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data stored within our systems and\nnetworks. And that data covers associates, customers, and suppliers. We work relentlessly to protect sensitive data through a\ncomprehensive program of technologies, procedural requirements, policies, and controls, as well as being staffed by well-trained\nand experienced cybersecurity professionals.\nCar-Mart’s data security efforts are led by our Senior Vice President of Technology, who reports to our CEO. Data security and\nprivacy are overseen by these groups:\n• Information Security Steering Committee, a cross-functional group of senior leaders\n• Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\n• Innovation and Technology Committee of the Board of Directors\nRisk Assessment and Controls\nWe understand there are risks to our information through external and internal efforts. To effectively identify vulnerabilities\nand remediate risks that could impact the information we store, we utilize controls, technologies and processes that align\nwith leading industry standards. Dedicated associates test, scan, and search daily for vulnerabilities and assess if there are any\nrisks to customer data. Additional security and safeguards are provided through third-party security services and software in\nour cloud environment and data centers. These third parties conduct 24/7 monitoring, external audits, and threat assessments\nagainst our environment. The audit and assessment services are provided throughout the year, with immediate remediation if\nany concern is raised.\nIn the event of a data breach, Car-Mart will comply with all applicable state and federal requirements to notify appropriate\nregulatory agencies and potentially affected customers, associates and other third parties. We will also provide credit protection\nservices to any customer affected should such a breach occur. To date, we have not experienced any data breaches in our 42-year\nhistory.\nAAmmeerriiccaa’’ss CCaarr--MMaarrtt RReessppoonnssiibbiilliittyy RReeppoorrtt 2200\nEngaged Associates\nDrive Customer\nRelationships\nFor Car-Mart to be successful, our associates must be engaged, invested, and committed\nto living our four values every day, especially as they interact with and nurture relationships\nwith our customers. Our business is all about building relationships with individual customers\nand within our local communities. When our associates are committed and helpful to our customers\nand our communities, we deliver on the Car-Mart mission. By investing in the relationships with our\ncustomers we can help them be successful and navigate the challenges they may face regarding vehicle ownership.\nOur customers are hardworking people often struggling with managing their finances from paycheck to paycheck. They are:\n• Credit challenged (no credit, poor credit, former repossessions, or bankruptcy);\n• In need of a vehicle;\n• Needing to build credit;\n• Living paycheck to paycheck – price sensitive and budget conscious;\n• Intimidated by the car-buying experience;\n• Wanting hope – looking for a low-down payment;\n• Wanting peace of mind – concerned about being taken advantage of;\n• Anxious about the car-buying and financing process.\nOur Customers and Our Communities\nBuilding lasting and successful relationships with our customers means understanding the communities in which we serve\nthem. Car-Mart aims to promote financial inclusion in rural communities, with a focus on serving low-income borrowers in\nthese communities, by offering equitable access to fair and transparent credit. A majority of Car-Mart’s active contracts with\ncustomers come from communities that have been designated as a “Credit-At-Risk” or a “Credit-Insecure” community based\non a 2019 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) entitled, “Unequal Access to Credit: The Hidden Impact of\nCredit Constraints” (the Report).\nAs demonstrated in the table below, when comparing obligor zip codes from Car-Mart’s portfolio of receivables to counties listed\nin the Report, 55.16% of the total number of Car-Mart’s contracts were originated for customers in the bottom two categories\nof Instability Score. According to the Report, “Higher index scores indicate that a community is more credit constrained, or\ncredit insecure, than communities with lower scores. In other words, higher index scores identify communities with a larger\nshare of residents who are unlikely to obtain credit at choice for resiliency or opportunity than communities with lower index\nscores.” The Report utilizes the Community Credit framework to divide communities into two subgroups – those with a credit\nscore and those without. Residents with no credit score are not connected to a mainstream credit institution and face limited,\nmore expensive options for credit, if at all. Residents in the formal credit economy with credit constraining outcomes may find it\nchallenging to borrow or to withstand emergencies. We believe this data underscores Car-Mart’s commitment to serving diverse\ncommunities with varying socioeconomic statuses.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart Responsibility Report 21\nCustomer\nCont...\nRelationships\nCredit Insecurity Index Distribution by County for Car-Mart Portfolio:\nInstability Score Total Number % of Total Number Total Outstanding % of Total Outstanding\nof Contracts of Contracts Principal Balance Principal Balance\n0.

According to the Report, “Access to credit\nis an asset for individuals to pursue economic opportunity and enhance\nfinancial security.” The Report seeks to better assess a community’s\nability to access credit products at fair terms when they choose, which\nis “credit at choice.” 1 Traditional analysis only focusing on those\nnot in the formal credit economy often overlooks those with credit\nconstraining outcomes for whom “credit at choice” is unavailable. The\nReport seeks to measure a community’s ability to access this credit at\nchoice by incorporating both populations into their “Credit Insecurity\nIndex score” to develop a more accurate and nuanced method of\nevaluating counties. Certain counties were identified as having limited\naccess to credit at choice due to significant numbers of residents that\nare either unbanked or have credit-limiting histories. The table below\nrepresents the U.S. adult population distribution by county and credit\ninsecurity index tiers, as presented in the Report, illustrating that\na majority of U.S. adults reside in “Mid-Tier,” “Credit-Likely” and\n“Credit-Assured” counties. By comparison, the majority of Car-Mart\ncustomers are in the “Credit-At-Risk” and “Credit-Insecure” counties.\n1.

We find meaningful ways to give back and be an advocate\nand champion for our communities. It’s all about our vision of making our communities\nbetter places – one customer at a time. Car-Mart and our associates are dedicated to making\na difference in our local communities through health-care related groups, food banks, toy drives,\nhelping local schools, relief efforts and other local activities. Since May 2015, more than $680,000 has\nbeen donated to local and national organizations for the benefit of Car-Mart’s communities. Some programs\nare sponsored Company-wide; others are decided and driven by local engagement, including monetary donations and\nvolunteer time from associates.\nCompany-Sponsored Programs\nDrive Away Cancer\nEvery October, we support Breast Cancer Awareness Month\nthrough our “Drive Away Cancer” promotion. Every Car-Mart\ndealership helps promote this initiative which culminates\nwith donations in each of our four regions to the American\nCancer Society.\nAppreciating our Military and\nFirst Responder Communities\nWe are also committed to supporting the brave men and\nwomen who serve and have served our country. We are\ngrateful for the sacrifices and selfless acts made by our\nveterans and first responders. Many of our Car-Mart\nassociates have served and given themselves selflessly as well,\nso we want to do our part to pay it forward to our service\npeople and first responders.\nThrough the years, we have partnered with several veteran\nand first-responder organizations, including “Hope for\nHeroes Foundation,” an organization supporting veterans,\npolice officers, firefighters, and emergency responders. The\norganization’s mission is to help those heroes who have been\nemotionally and/or physically disabled in the line of duty.\nHoliday Toy Drive\nIn 2009, our dealerships in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area\nbegan collecting toys during the holiday season to deliver\nto St. Francis Children’s Hospital. Since that time, all our\ndealerships have participated in this event.\nDuring the Holiday season of 2023, we collected over 31,000\ntoys that were donated to 31 children’s hospitals in our\ncommunities, as well as other nonprofits such as the Poshard\nFoundation in Carterville, Illinois and Potter Children’s Home\nin Bowling Green, Kentucky. Stories of how toys provide a\npositive impact to young patients can be found on our Car-\nMart Blog at https://www.car-mart.com/blog.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart Responsibility Report 23\nCorporate\nLocal Programs and Giving Citizenship\nBack in our Communities\nPaying it Forward – Helping Our Neighbors\nAt Car-Mart, we are big fans of Paying It Forward to our loyal customers. Random acts\nof kindness can go a long way in making a difference in someone’s day. We believe in\nassisting those customers and others in our communities who may need a helping hand\nor a friendly smile. We enjoy performing charitable deeds such as delivering groceries or\nbaby supplies.\nOur community appreciation events happen throughout the year across the communities\nin which we operate. We are proud to say that we frequently donate to nonprofit\norganizations where our dealerships are located. Those donations include volunteer time,\nfinancial assistance and in-kind services.\nThrough our Grand Openings and Community Appreciation Events, we regularly support\norganizations important to our associates and customers – our neighbors – that make a\ndifference locally. Many of our activities support children, military and first responders,\nand cancer treatment and prevention. Locally, other groups beyond these core focus areas\nalso receive assistance, and these include efforts that benefit organizations ranging from\nthe Salvation Army to the Boys and Girls Club. In addition to the organizations already\nmentioned, below are examples of various organizations and local groups that have\nbenefited from our support and other volunteer efforts during the past year:\n• Hope for Heroes\n• American Cancer Society\n• Arkansas Childrens Hospital\n• Hope Cancer Resources\n• Local Food Pantries\n• Paducah Family Services Society\n• Junior Achievement of Arkansas, Tulsa, OK and Tennessee\n• Habitat for Humanity Women Build in Hot Springs, AR\n• Emergency Infant Services in Tulsa, OK\n• Serve Springdale Community Day\n• Woodstock, GA Middle School Teacher Supply Donation and Backpack Drive\n• Car-Mart of Van Buren, Little Rock and Corinth collected supplies to help those\naffected by the tornado\n• City of Stars Basketball Youth program in Jonesboro, AR\n• Jones Center of Springdale, AR\nMembers of our management\n• Mercy Hospital Foundation team, including local\ndealerships, also serve as\n• Burlesworth Foundation volunteers or board members\nfor various nonprofit groups.\n• Northwest Arkansas Children’s Shelter\nOur Chief Executive Officer\n• Economics Arkansas Emeritus, Jeff Williams,\ncurrently serves on the\n• SOAR Northwest Arkansas\nboards of directors for Mercy\n• Springdale Public School Foundation Health Northwest Arkansas\nCommunities since 2019\n• Various community food banks and the Jones Center and\nJones Trust since 2021.\n• Local schools\nJeff is passionate about\n• Athletic programs the Company’s vision of\nimproving the communities\n• Booster clubs\nwe serve.\n• Financial literacy efforts\n• Teacher appreciation events\nAmerica’s Car-Mart Responsibility Report 24\nEnvironmental:\nRespecting our Footprint\nEvaluating Our Carbon Footprint\nAt Car-Mart, we recognize that our company and associates have an impact on the\nenvironment. We are committed to conducting operations at Car-Mart in an ethical and socially\nresponsible way, and we are sensitive to the needs of the environment and the local communities in\nwhich we operate. We respect the environment because we know that the future depends on how we care\nfor it today. Environmental stewardship aligns with our mission, values, and makes good business sense for\nour associates and customers. Further, we believe that a sustainable environment requires participation and cooperation\nfrom every associate, supplier, business partner and customer.\nAs a company, we are committed to reviewing the environmental impact of our operations and services and setting appropriate\nenvironmental improvement goals. Starting in 2022 an independent third party has been retained to perform quarterly lot\ninspections for safety, environmental, and maintenance issues.\nIt is important to meet the requirements of relevant legislation and regulations, as well as standards and codes of practice\naccepted for the auto dealership industry. We also believe in the importance of being efficient with our resources and identifying\nareas where resources such as computers can be resold in other markets.\nEnergy Efficiency\nIn our ongoing commitment to minimize our carbon footprint, we are actively enhancing energy efficiency across all our\nlocations by:\n• Installing and upgrading to LED lighting.\n• Implementing energy-saving, motion-sensitive lighting solutions.\n• Retrofitting traditional fixtures with higher-efficiency, water-saving alternatives.\n• Installing and upgrading to energy-efficient HVAC systems.\nCorporate Office LEED Certified\nIn 2020, we moved our Corporate Office from Bentonville to Rogers, Arkansas. This is a leased facility and a certified LEED\n(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) building. The LEED certification is a globally recognized symbol of\nsustainability achievement and leadership.\nThis building was renovated with improved technology and efficient mechanical, electrical, plumbing, access, and elevator\nsystems. The move promotes a better working environment that promotes safety and fosters creativity; further, it underscores\nour commitment to environmental stewardship because the building offers a wide range of green building features.\nLEED supplies a framework for healthy, highly efficient and cost-saving green buildings, and we are pleased that renovations\nresulted in improvements to our environmental stewardship, including:\n• All lighting controlled by motion sensors;\n• HVAC systems regulated by time and people usage;\n• HVAC systems set to “energy efficiency” mode on weekends;\n• All workstations have recycling containers for cardboard and aluminum cans;\n• Paper is shredded and recycled by a third-party supplier;\n• Computers turn off when not in use and associates are encouraged to power down their equipment when not working;\n• 100% of computers, monitors, office electronics, and related hardware are recycled or sent to resellers to harvest usable parts.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart Responsibility Report 25\nEnvironmental\nFootprint\nExtending Care for the\nEnvironment Operationally\nOur business strategy is based on sourcing, procuring, and offering “front- line ready” vehicles for our customers. These are\nvehicles considered up-to-date on required maintenance and ready for customer purchase. As such, we extend the life cycle of\nthese vehicles and in turn lessen the environmental impact of used vehicle disposal.\nAt Car-Mart, we take a meticulous approach to selecting vehicles to purchase because we believe the quality and maintenance\nof a vehicle impacts the customer and the environment. For efficiency purposes, every location strives to deliver a vehicle that\nis “Front-Line” retail ready with just a need for a wash and some detailing. Each vehicle must meet stringent requirements\nbefore it becomes a Car-Mart vehicle. The Company’s internal condition report guides our car buyers on items to examine as a\npart of the pre-purchase inspection, along with photos for quality review. The condition report is followed by an associate test\ndrive that allows the vehicle to reach full operating temperature. These steps ensure reliable performance and longer life of the\ncustomer’s vehicle.\nApproximately 20% of our dealerships have lifts and mechanics to service vehicles ahead of their purchase. All other dealerships\nrely on local third-party service providers for maintenance related activities, including tire changing, battery replacement, oil\nchanges and car detailing. We choose these local suppliers carefully, with a goal of ensuring that they practice proper storage,\nhandling, and transportation of these materials.\nAt the facilities where we provide service, all automotive fluids collected from servicing vehicles are managed and handled by\nthird-party refiners. When washing and detailing vehicles to ensure they are “Front-Line” ready, we require our associates and\nvendors to follow industry practices for water conservation and proper handling of detailing chemicals. We educate all associates\nabout the importance of minimal use of water and good conservation practices during these maintenance activities.\nOur business strategy depends on keeping the cars on\nthe road. Good vehicle maintenance and proper driving\nhabits can contribute to reducing a vehicle’s footprint\non our planet. All customers receive a “How to Maintain\nYour Vehicle” guide and the company regularly supplies\neducational materials on our website, social media channels\nand at dealerships on necessary routine maintenance\nIncorporating Dealerships into\nLocal Communities\nOur goal is to be recognized as a good neighbor where we\noperate our dealerships. That commitment starts when we\ngo before a local planning board for site approval either for a\nnew location or an expansion. Our dealerships are mostly in\ncommercially- zoned areas. We adhere to all local regulations\non wastewater retention, conservation, landscaping, waste\nmanagement and recycling.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart Responsibility Report 26\nEnvironmental\nFootprint\nLeveraging Today’s\nVirtual World\nWe leaned into technology to support our\nassociates and customers during the pandemic\nand continue to expand these opportunities\ntoday. We support the growing needs of our\nbusiness and customers by offering flexible\nwork options to certain associates, including\noccasionally working from home. In addition,\nwe provide both in-person and virtual one-\non-one sessions of our Future Managers\ntraining. Associate travel is optimized so\nvirtual meetings are used to the extent\npossible. These changes have contributed to a\nreduction in our overall carbon footprint and a\nmore flexible workforce.\nAs we build on what we have learned, our\nassociates will have more opportunities to\nleverage virtual work options for flexibility in\nconducting their job. We are also continuing\nour efforts to provide our customers with\nadditional flexibility in shopping for a\nvehicle online as an extension of our physical\nlocations. In 2024, we will expand our\ncapabilities by providing customers with the\nability to get pre-qualified online for financing\nand schedule a visit.\nEnvironmental Risks\nWe understand and recognize the changing\nglobal climate impacts us all. We are not\nimmune to such changes and, as such,\nunderstand that they pose a gradually\nincreasing risk to our operations. These risks\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n• Increasing frequency of severe weather\nevents in our target geographic market\ncomprised of the south-central and\nsoutheast United States. In addition\nto increased frequency, the increasing\nseverity of hurricanes, tornadoes, floods,\nand heat waves could significantly disrupt\nour dealership operations vis-à-vis\nregional economic impacts.\n• Transitions in consumer demand for\nused electric and hybrid vehicles due to\nmore stringent emission regulations,\nfuel economy standards, and shifting\nmanufacturer product offerings.\nAmerica’s Car-Mart Responsibility Report 27\nGovernance:\nResponsibility Backed\nby Strong Governance\nPrinciples\nOur Board of Directors is committed to strong governance to drive the long-term growth\nof the Company for our shareholders. The Board oversees the strategic direction of America’s\nCar-Mart and has the necessary authority and practices in place to review and evaluate our business\noperations and to make decisions independent of management. Directors communicate directly with\nsenior management and receive regular updates from the management team on many areas of our business and\noperations. All Board members reviewed this Corporate Responsibility Report before its publication and supported ongoing\ncommunications about these practices.\nBoard of Directors\nCar-Mart is privileged to have a Board of Directors currently comprised of eight highly qualified\nindividuals, with three-fourths — six members — being independent directors, who are\nactively involved in the strategic oversight of the Company. Directors serve one-year terms,\nand under the Company’s Bylaws, each Board nominee must receive a majority of the shares\nvoted at our annual Shareholders’ meeting to be elected to the Board.\nThe Chairman of the Board is an independent director. This allows the Chief Executive Officer to\nfocus on the management of the business and our day-to-day operations, rather than serving\nas Board chair. We believe the separation of these roles is currently in the best interests of\nthe Company’s shareholders and allows for more effective Board oversight of the Company’s\noperations. However, the Board of Directors does not have a policy that prohibits the CEO from\nserving as the Chair because it desires the flexibility to determine in the future that one person\nshould hold both positions if such leadership structure would be in the best interests of the\nCompany and shareholders.\nThe Board of Directors believes that the Board should collectively possess a combination of\nskills, professional experience and diversity of backgrounds necessary to oversee our business.\nThis aligns with our overall commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion detailed earlier in\nthis report. Currently, three of our eight directors (37.5%) are women. In seeking a diversity\nof experiences, the Board works to select nominees that cover a range of viewpoints and\nperspectives.
