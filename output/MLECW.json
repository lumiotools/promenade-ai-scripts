          "content": "Moolec Has Received USDA Approval\nFor The First Genetically Modified Pea In History\nLuxembourg. October 16, 2024 - Moolec Science SA (NASDAQ: MLEC; “the Company”), a\nleader in Molecular Farming technology, announced today that the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture’s (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) has completed\nits Regulatory Status Review (“RSR”) for the Company’s genetically engineered (“GE”) peas\nwhich produce iron through bovine meat proteins. This is the third regulatory clearance\nfrom USDA-APHIS achieved by Moolec in an 18-month window, alongside its genetically\nengineered safflower and soybean for GLASO™ and Piggy Sooy™ products, respectively.\nAccess the official USDA-APHIS publication here.\n“With USDA approval for our GE pea, Moolec has now secured regulatory clearance for all\nof our key crops in the US: safflower, soybean, and pea,” said Gastón Paladini, CEO and Co-\nFounder of Moolec. “We are proud to be the only Molecular Farming company with three\nUS regulatory approvals and a major commercial contract. This milestone underscores our\nleadership in the landscape with tangible, science-backed results.”\nMoolec’s genetically engineered peas produce high yields of bovine myoglobin, a protein\nthat boosts iron content, making it an ideal alternative for consumers seeking plant-based\nsources of iron. This product has the potential to revolutionize both the food ingredient\nmarket and the $65 billion pea industry by offering a nutritious, iron-rich alternative to\ntraditional meat products.\nAmit Dhingra, Chief Science Officer for the Company, stated, “The USDA-APHIS Regulatory\nStatus Review for pea marks a significant milestone for Moolec. As the first review for GE\npea, it represents a historic development. It validates Moolec’s strategic approach and\nexemplifies our commitment advancing sustainable food production through science and\ninnovation. This approval is a critical step toward enhancing global food supply and meeting\nthe growing demand for innovative, nutritious food solutions for the world.”\nThis approval not only showcases Moolec’s innovation in Molecular Farming but also\nhighlights the company’s commitment to meeting the highest regulatory and safety\nstandards. Moolec has also developed an Identity Preservation Program to ensure\nsustainable farming practices, promote stewardship for its crops and product quality for\npartners, clients and consumers alike.\nAccording to USDA-APHIS regulation found at 7 CFR part 340, developers may submit a\nrequest for a RSR when they believe a GE plant is not subject to the regulation. APHIS\nreviews the GE plant and considers whether it might pose an increased plant pest risk\ncompared to its non-GE comparator. If APHIS does not identify a greater pest risk relative\nto the comparator, the GE plant is not subject to this regulation. Regulation 7 CFR part 340\ngoverns the importation, interstate movement, and the environmental release of certain\norganisms that have been modified or produced by genetic engineering.\nThe USDA-APHIS review process is a critical component of ensuring that genetically\nengineered crops can be grown safely, and this approval opens the floor for expanded field\ntrials, seed scaling, and eventual commercialization. With increasing interest in science-\nbased ingredients, this approval positions the company to lead a new wave of innovation in\nthe food and agriculture sectors.\nAbout Moolec Science SA\nMoolec is a science-based ingredient company leader in the use of Molecular Farming\ntechnology for food and dietary supplementation markets. The Company’s mission is to\ncreate unique food ingredients by engineering plants with animal protein genes. Its purpose\nis to redefine the way the world produces animal proteins for the good of the planet.\nMoolec’s technological approach aims to have the cost structure of plant-based solutions\nwith the nutrition and functionality of animal-based ones.

          "content": "Moolec Becomes First Molecular Farming Company\nto Achieve USDA Approval for Plant-Grown Animal Proteins\nLuxembourg. April 22, 2024 - Moolec Science SA (NASDAQ: MLEC; “The company”),\na Molecular Farming food-ingredient company, announced today that the Animal and\nPlant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\n(“USDA”) has concluded its Regulatory Status Review (“RSR”) for Moolec’s genetically\nengineered (“GE”) soybean Piggy Sooy™. See post online here:\nhttps://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/23-234-01rsr-response.pdf 1.\nThe USDA-APHIS RSR determines that Moolec’s genetically engineered soybean,\naccumulating animal meat protein, is unlikely to pose an increased plant pest risk\nrelative to non-engineered soybeans. Therefore, it is not subject to the APHIS\nregulation that governs the movement of organisms modified or produced through\ngenetic engineering (as described in 7 CFR part 340).\n“Moolec embraced Nasdaq's slogan 'Rewrite Tomorrow' and took it literally! We\nachieved an unprecedented milestone in biotechnology with the first-ever USDA-\nAPHIS approval of this kind,\" stated Gastón Paladini, Moolec Science’s CEO & Co-\nFounder. “We are unlocking the power of plants by leveraging science to overcome\nclimate change and global food security concerns. I am very proud of the Moolec\nteam, creating value for shareholders and the planet at the same time”.\nThis milestone reinforces Moolec's B2B go-to-market strategy for Piggy Sooy™\nproduct, an innovative, functional, and nutritious ingredient. By adding a well-known\nanimal meat protein (porcine myoglobin) to the standard soybean proteins, the\ncompany expects to provide food manufacturers with a unique ingredient that will\nhave a positive carbon and water footprint.\nMartin Salinas, Chief of Technology & Co-Founder at Moolec, enthusiastically\nannounced: \"We believe this milestone sets the stage for a revolution in the food-\nindustrial biotech landscape, paving the way for expedited adoption of Molecular\nFarming technology by other industry players. Also, this compelling advancement\nsignifies a stride in enhancing our operational efficiency, transforming our methods of\nraw material sourcing, and optimizing our downstream crushing and processing\noperations.”\nIn June 2023, the company announced that Piggy Sooy™ seeds had achieved high\nlevels of expression of pork protein (up to 26.6% of the total soluble protein) and had\npatented their technology. The company clarifies that Piggy Sooy™ development is\nset to keep moving forward completing the necessary consultation with the United\nStates Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Moolec declares to be engaged in the\nconsultation process with the FDA, representing the next pivotal regulatory milestone\npreceding the commercial availability of Piggy Sooy™ ingredient.\n1 In the first paragraph of the USDA-APHIS online response letter, please note that the term \"gene editing\" should\nbe understood as \"genetic engineering\" due to an unintentional error that may be addressed in the coming days.\nAbout Moolec Science SA\nMoolec is a science-based ingredient company leader in the use of Molecular Farming\ntechnology for food and dietary supplementation markets.

The Insud\nConvertible Note will be issued against a cash payment of US$10 million and in-kind contributions to\nbe made by Insud to Moolec. In-kind contributions include credits to access Insud’s state-of-the-art\nindustrial capabilities, operational services, and the incorporation of Joint Venture participation,\nstarted with Moolec in 2021. At maturity, Moolec will hold the option to deliver ordinary shares, cash,\nor a combination of cash and ordinary shares.\nThis transaction follows Moolec’s previous announcement that it entered into a Memorandum of\nUnderstanding with Bioceres Crop Solutions (NASDAQ: BIOX; “BIOX”) that secures the supply of\napproximately 15,000 tons of HB4® soybeans (the “BIOX Supply Agreement”) that may be upsized\nfor a similar volume. The BIOX Supply Agreement will be paid through the issuance of a convertible\nnote (the “BIOX Convertible Note'' and together with the Insud Convertible Note, the “Convertible\nNotes”) on arms-length terms to the Insud Convertible Note.\nUnder the BIOX Supply Agreement, Bioceres Crop Solutions will engage with Generation HB4® farmers\nto source and deliver to Moolec soybeans with a sustainability-linked premium, which are produced\nunder regenerative agricultural practices, minimizing water, carbon, and chemical footprints. The\nGeneration HB4® program is an identity-preserved farming program that utilizes HB4® drought-\ntolerance technology to enable soybean-wheat crop rotations and improve agricultural sustainability.\nTogether, the Convertible Notes total approximately US$30 million of cash and in-kind contributions\nthat include soybean inventories, operational services, and the acquisition of Joint Venture equity.\n“We are thrilled to announce these agreements, which highlight the importance of incorporating\nstrategic players as shareholders. We are very proud to count with Insud, a biotech leader in life\nsciences industries, and Bioceres Crop Solutions, a top-notch ag-biotech player, as key partners for the\nupcoming stages of the Company’s development,” said Gastón Paladini, Moolec’s Chief Executive\nOfficer. “We all share the common purpose to redefine the way we produce animal-based food, for\ngood and for all.

If the trading price of Moolec’s ordinary shares\nexceeds the strike price of US$6.00 per ordinary share (the “Strike Price”) for 10 trading days, Insud\nwill have the option to exercise the early conversion option pursuant to which the principal amount\noutstanding under the Insud Note may be converted into ordinary shares of Moolec at the Strike Price.\nThe Strike Price represents a premium of approximately 100% of the 20-day VWAP of Moolec’s\nordinary shares. At maturity, Moolec has the option to convert the principal amount outstanding\nunder the Insud Note into ordinary shares. In connection with Insud’s early conversion option and\nMoolec’s optional conversion at maturity, Moolec may deliver ordinary shares, cash, or a combination\nof cash and ordinary shares to Insud.
