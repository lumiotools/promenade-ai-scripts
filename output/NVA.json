A mineral resource is defined as a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality,\nand quantity, that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction.\n2. The mineral resource applies a reasonable prospect of economic extraction with the following assumptions:\n• Gold price of US$2,000/oz\n• 5% royalty on recovered ounces\n• Pit slope angle of 50o\n• Mining cost of US$1.65/t\n• Processing cost for RPM US$9.80/t and Korbel US$5.23/t (inclusive of ore sorting for Korbel)\n• Combined processing recoveries of 88.20% for RPM and 75.94% for Korbel\n• General and Administrative Cost of US$1.30/t\n• Tonnages and grades are rounded to two significant figures and ounces are rounded to 1,000 ounces, subject to rounding\nASX Announcement 16 April 2024\nAppendix 2: Characteristics of Bulk Tonnage Mines\nGeology and Geometry Come First\n•\nThick drill intercepts > 100m, and often at lower average grades\n•\nMineralization at surface with low strip ratios\n•\nLarge tonnage moved, but a large proportion of the material is ore, meaning\nless waste\n•\nOpen pit operations using conventional truck and shovel mining methods\n•\nA central processing plant proximal to the ore source requiring short haul\nKinross Gold Corp - Fort Knox Gold Mine\ndistance\n•\nOften include heap leach process circuit for lower cost gold recovery The Fort Knox gold mine, owned by Kinross Gold\n• Corp, is a highly profitable, large scale bulk tonnage\nTypically produce > 100,000 g/t Au per year at lower AISC’s\nopen-pit gold mine, located near the city of\n•\nKinross Gold Corp Fort Knox mine is a good example of a highly profitable low\nFairbanks, Alaska.

Nova Minerals (NVA) is a client of RedChip Companies, Inc. NVA agreed to pay RedChip Companies, Inc. a $5,000 monthly cash fee, beginning in August 2024, and 10,000 shares of Rule 144 ADS, for six months of investor awareness\nservices. RedChip will receive an additional 10,000 shares of Rule 144 ADS when the average five-day trading volume reaches 100,000 ADS per day or NVA’s market cap reaches $75 million. NVA also agreed to pay RedChip a fifty-thousand dollar fee for a national TV\nad campaign scheduled to air weekdays in August 2024. Investor awareness services and programs are designed to help small-cap companies communicate their investment characteristics.\nNasdaq: NVA\nValue Proposition\nNova Minerals presents a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to large-scale gold projects\nat a significant discount. With its flagship Estelle Gold Project in Alaska, the company holds a growing multi-million\nounce gold resource in a region renowned for Tier 1 gold deposits [Donlin Creek (45Moz Au); Fort Knox (11Moz Au);\nand Pogo (6.9Moz)]. Currently, NVA trades at an extremely low A$6 per ounce of gold on an enterprise value basis,\ncompared to the sector average of A$70/oz.\nThe ongoing metallurgical and flow sheet work for the Feasibility Study (FS) is expected to further optimize project\neconomics, with the potential to incorporate innovative processing techniques and additional near-term revenue from\nsurface level critical minerals like antimony. With a clear pathway to permitting, strong exploration potential, and a\nFeasibility Study under way, which is expected to deliver strong economic results with both gold and antimony prices\ncurrently at all-time highs, Nova Minerals offers a high-upside, underappreciated asset for investors looking for\ngrowth in the gold and critical minerals sectors.\nAntimony Opportunity: Critical Mineral Supply Chain Potential\nNova Minerals is positioned to capitalize on a significant opportunity with antimony at its Estelle Project. The antimony\nproject represents a near-term revenue opportunity separate from Nova’s potential large-scale gold operations at\nRPM and Korbel. With ongoing testing and exploration, Nova aims to establish itself as a key player in supplying\nantimony to the U.S. market, mitigating risks from global supply chain constraints—particularly in light of recent\nexport restrictions from China, the world’s dominant antimony producer.\nRecent fieldwork at Estelle has confirmed the presence of extensive high-grade stibnite (antimony) vein zones, with\nassay results from a previous discovery at Stibium showing 60.5% antimony (Sb) and 12.7 g/t gold over a 2-meter\nvein. Bulk samples of 2,500 kg and 500 kg have been collected from the Stibium and Styx prospects, respectively, and\nare currently undergoing metallurgical test work. This is a crucial step towards fast-tracking a stand-alone antimony\nproduction scenario, with Nova actively collaborating with the U.S. Department of Defense for potential grant funding.\nRedChip Companies, Inc. research reports, company profiles and other investor relations materials, publications or presentations, including web content, are based on data obtained from sources we believe to be reliable but are not guaranteed as to accuracy and are not\npurported to be complete.
