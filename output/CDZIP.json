(NASDAQ: CDZI) (the “Company” or “Cadiz”) announced today that the Company and the Lytton Rancheria of California (“Lytton”) have signed a Letter of Intent for Lytton to invest up to $50 million in the Company’s groundwater banking project in the Mojave Desert (“Mojave Groundwater Bank”). Lytton’s investment would be the first major investment by a Native American Tribe in large-scale water infrastructure off tribal lands in U.S. history. With 2.5 million acre-feet of new water supply and an estimated 30 million acre-feet of water in storage today, the Mojave Groundwater Bank will be the largest new groundwater bank in the Southwest.\n\nThe partnership between Cadiz and Lytton signifies a landmark collaboration in water resource management, with Tribes holding a majority ownership stake in the Mojave Groundwater Bank. This ownership structure empowers Indigenous communities to play a leading role in decision-making and investment in vital water projects.\n\nLytton Tribal Chairperson Andy Mejia stated, “As a Tribal Government, we take our responsibility to be good stewards of the land and the environment seriously. Working with other Tribal Governments, Cadiz and other responsible environmental investors to develop a sustainable, responsibly managed water source in these shifting times is something we want to be involved in. With Tribal involvement in the direction and operation of this project, we can ensure that all people have a chance to benefit from this critical water resource.”\n\nCadiz CEO and Chairperson of the Board Susan Kennedy also stated, “We are proud and honored to create this groundbreaking partnership with Lytton to develop this important project for the benefit of underserved and indigenous communities. Access to clean water will be the single greatest challenge many communities in California and the Southwest face in the coming decades. We are grateful for the chance to be part of the solution.”\n\nThe Mojave Groundwater Bank is a clean water infrastructure project being developed by Cadiz in California’s Mojave Desert. The groundwater bank at Cadiz is located at the base of a 2,000 square mile watershed system fed by rain and snow in the high desert New York and Providence mountains. The underground reservoir holds an estimated 30 – 40 million acre-feet of water in storage today – more water than is presently stored in Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the two largest surface reservoirs in the United States, combined.\n\nThe Mojave Groundwater Bank will include more than 300 miles of pipelines that intersect California’s water transportation network to provide new clean water supply and storage resources to underserved, disadvantaged and tribal communities in the Mojave River Basin, the Colorado River Basin and California’s Inland Empire that presently lack access to clean, reliable water.\n\nCadiz anticipates construction of the Project to begin in 2025 with initial water delivery targeted for as early as 2026.\n\nFor additional details regarding the LOI with Lytton Rancheria of California, please refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, November 25, 2024.\n\n[ Download PDF ](https://cadizinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PR-Cadiz-MGB-Lytton-LOI-11-25-24-Final.pdf)\n\n[PrevPrevious](https://cadizinc.com/cadiz-to-purchase-180-miles-of-new-pipeline-assets/)\n\nShare the Post:\n\nNewsletter Signup \n\nSubmit\n\n## Related Posts\n\n###  [ Cadiz to Purchase 180 Miles of New Pipeline Assets ](https://cadizinc.com/cadiz-to-purchase-180-miles-of-new-pipeline-assets/)\n\nSteel from terminated Keystone XL Pipeline Project to be repurposed for water delivery as Company prepares for construction of groundwater banking project LOS ANGELES, CA 11.12.24\n\n[ Read More » ](https://cadizinc.com/cadiz-to-purchase-180-miles-of-new-pipeline-assets/)\n\nNovember 12, 2024 \n\n###  [ Cadiz Inc.

(NASDAQ: CDZI) (the “Company” or “Cadiz”) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to purchase 180-miles of steel pipe from the terminated Keystone XL Pipeline Project. The Company plans to use the steel pipe for the construction of a pipeline network connecting the Company’s groundwater bank in the Mojave Desert to major water networks in the Southwestern U.S. The 180 miles of new steel pipe will be added to the Company’s expansive portfolio of pipeline assets, including 220 miles of existing pipeline acquired by the Company from El Paso Natural Gas in 2021. The 180 miles of new steel pipe will be used to expand the Company’s pipeline network creating the largest new groundwater bank in the Southwest. The Company plans to begin construction in 2025.\n\n“Repurposing fossil fuel infrastructure to deliver clean water to underserved communities is core to our mission,” said Cadiz CEO Susan Kennedy. “Securing this steel will enable the Company to bring this critical infrastructure online faster and more efficiently.”\n\n“It’s inspiring to see that sometimes hope and history align. The steel from the Keystone pipeline has found a new purpose—now transporting what gives life to everything: water. I commend the Cadiz leadership for their vision of creating a better future for our children.” Dave Archambault II, Former Tribal Chairman Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.\n\nThe Keystone XL crude oil pipeline project sponsored by Canadian company, TC Energy, was terminated in 2021 after the Biden Administration revoked a presidential permit which would have allowed the pipeline to cross the Canada-U.S. border. Approximately 200 miles of unused steel pipeline from the abandoned project is currently stored on land in North Dakota. After several months of diligence to determine the suitability of the 36” steel pipe for transportation of water, Cadiz determined the Keystone pipe was a perfect fit for the Company’s groundwater banking project in the Mojave Desert (the “Mojave Groundwater Bank”).\n\n“Converting the Keystone from an oil pipeline to a water pipeline serving disenfranchised communities is the ultimate definition of environmental justice,” said David Sickey, former Senior Advisor to the U.S. Department of Energy and former Chairman Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana.\n\nIn October, the Company announced it had entered into a letter of intent (the “LOI”) with a non-profit investment fund (“Fund’) for a prospective investment up to $150 million for the construction, ownership, and operation of the Mojave Groundwater Bank. Under the terms of the LOI, the Fund along with other non-profit and public sector investors, including federally recognized Native American Tribes, will provide up to $401 million of equity capital to acquire assets and fund the construction of facilities for the Mojave Groundwater Bank, presently estimated in the amount of $800 million. The parties will coordinate to seek available grant funding for any remaining construction costs.\n\nFor additional details regarding the Company’s agreement for the purchase of the steel pipe assets, please refer to its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, November 12, 2024.\n\n[ Download PDF ](https://cadizinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cadiz_PR_Cadiz-Keystone-Pipeline-Acquisition-11-12-24-final-.pdf)\n\n[PrevPrevious](https://cadizinc.com/cadiz-inc-announces-23-million-registered-direct-offering/)\n\n[NextNext](https://cadizinc.com/lytton-rancheria-of-california-leads-tribal-investment-in-cadiz-groundwater-banking-project/)\n\nShare the Post:\n\nNewsletter Signup \n\nSubmit\n\n## Related Posts\n\n###  [ Lytton Rancheria of California Leads Tribal Investment in Cadiz Groundwater Banking Project ](https://cadizinc.com/lytton-rancheria-of-california-leads-tribal-investment-in-cadiz-groundwater-banking-project/)\n\n$50 million investment in Mojave Groundwater Bank would be the largest investment in water infrastructure off tribal-lands by Native American Tribes in U.S. history LOS\n\n[ Read More » ](https://cadizinc.com/lytton-rancheria-of-california-leads-tribal-investment-in-cadiz-groundwater-banking-project/)\n\nNovember 25, 2024 \n\n###  [ Cadiz Inc.

(NASDAQ: CDZI / CDZIP), a California water solutions company, and RIC Energy, a global renewable energy company, announced today they have entered into an agreement to build California’s largest green hydrogen facility at Cadiz Ranch in the Mojave Desert. Under the agreement, Cadiz will supply land and water to RIC Energy for the creation of industrial quantities of 100% green hydrogen using solar energy. Rail lines, pipelines and interstate highways that intersect Cadiz Ranch will deliver green hydrogen to Southern California markets to fuel zero-emission trucks, cars and electric generation.\n\n“Cadiz is proud to partner with RIC to bring this important new clean energy facility online,” said Cadiz CEO Susan Kennedy. “Cadiz sits at the crossroads of major rail, pipeline, and highway infrastructure in California’s Inland Empire with thousands of acres for solar and an aquifer system larger than Lake Mead. It is the ideal location for green hydrogen production – the largest hydrogen production facility in California.”\n\nRIC Energy chose the Cadiz area for its first US facility after a six-month diligence process that evaluated several locations across the state. Plans call for a self-sufficient, integrated, off-grid green hydrogen production facility utilizing photovoltaic (PV) solar for its power supply on up to 3,000 acres of the Cadiz Ranch. The new facility is expected to feature a combination of state-of-the-art technologies to create green hydrogen, complying with the strictest regulations of IRA’s Section 45V, using on-site Cadiz water resources and fully renewable electricity generated from a local solar array. Cadiz will supply up to 500 acre-feet of water per year for hydrogen production. Cadiz, in turn, will be able to use green hydrogen and solar to power its water supply and groundwater banking operations.\n\n“This is an exciting opportunity for RIC Energy,” said Jonathan Rappe, CEO of RIC Energy North America. “We have clean energy facilities in 14 countries on four continents, but this partnership with Cadiz is unique. In a single location that is close to roads, train lines and pipelines we have all the water, land and sun right at hand to build and operate what will be one of the world’s largest self-sufficient green hydrogen facilities to date.”\n\nWhen operating at full capacity, the clean energy facility will produce 50,000 kilograms of hydrogen per day to fuel zero-emission trucks and cars, as well as be able to supply to many other California industries currently using fossil hydrogen. Plans call for on-site electricity storage along with equipment to compress and liquefy the hydrogen for rail or road transportation. The site at Cadiz is also ideal for possible future hydrogen pipelines serving the Los Angeles region. The hydrogen can also be blended locally with natural gas for transport via on-site and nearby existing gas transmission pipeline networks, with the objective of serving California’s burgeoning hydrogen market and meeting California’s mandate to deliver 90% clean electricity by 2035.\n\nCalifornia is one of seven awardees of the Department of Energy’s [Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs](https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-clean-hydrogen-hubs-0) (H2Hubs). That designation is supported by a [landmark $12.6 billion agreement](https://archesh2.org/arches-officially-launches/), including $1.2 billion in federal funding, to build and expand the production of renewable hydrogen in California with all possible speed and will be managed by [ARCHES](https://archesh2.org/), the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, a California public-private partnership. RIC Energy’s project at Cadiz is a Tier 2 ARCHES project.\n\nAccording to ARCHES, its projects are expected to create over 200,000 green jobs in California and are forecast to generate $2.95 billion per year in economic value beginning in 2030, including significant health and healthcare cost savings from reduced pollution.\n\n[PrevPrevious](https://cadizinc.com/cadizs-atec-water-systems-wins-1-6m-in-new-sales-contracts/)\n\n[NextNext](https://cadizinc.com/solar-developer-unveils-plan-for-californias-largest-green-hydrogen-installation-in-the-mojave-desert/)\n\nShare the Post:\n\nNewsletter Signup \n\nSubmit\n\n## Related Posts\n\n###  [ Lytton Rancheria of California Leads Tribal Investment in Cadiz Groundwater Banking Project ](https://cadizinc.com/lytton-rancheria-of-california-leads-tribal-investment-in-cadiz-groundwater-banking-project/)\n\n$50 million investment in Mojave Groundwater Bank would be the largest investment in water infrastructure off tribal-lands by Native American Tribes in U.S. history LOS\n\n[ Read More » ](https://cadizinc.com/lytton-rancheria-of-california-leads-tribal-investment-in-cadiz-groundwater-banking-project/)\n\nNovember 25, 2024 \n\n###  [ Cadiz to Purchase 180 Miles of New Pipeline Assets ](https://cadizinc.com/cadiz-to-purchase-180-miles-of-new-pipeline-assets/)\n\nSteel from terminated Keystone XL Pipeline Project to be repurposed for water delivery as Company prepares for construction of groundwater banking project LOS ANGELES, CA 11.12.24\n\n[ Read More » ](https://cadizinc.com/cadiz-to-purchase-180-miles-of-new-pipeline-assets/)\n\nNovember 12, 2024 \n\n###  [ Cadiz Inc.

The filters will be capable of processing up to 10 million gallons per day.\n\n“I am proud of the work we are doing to help water districts, cities and disadvantaged communities clean up their groundwater, and we are excited to ramp up production at ATEC to meet the growing demand we’re seeing for our products.” said Lee Odell, ATEC’s Chief Operating Officer.”\n\nSince Cadiz acquired ATEC’s assets in 2023 for $2 million, ATEC has experienced rapid growth in orders in 2024 propelled by tightening water quality regulatory standards and the need to integrate groundwater into the portfolio of water supply for growing communities. Cadiz continues to expect gross ATEC segment revenues to reach $15 million for fiscal year 2024 and anticipates strong segment growth in 2025.\n\nThe ATEC treatment system uses patent-pending filter media processes to remove common groundwater contaminants by adsorption. The filters and systems are fully scalable and can be manufactured to different sizes and specifications depending on the volume of groundwater treated; contracts to date range from 60 million gallons a day for the largest water conservancy district in Utah to customized smaller systems for isolated smaller communities dependent on groundwater for their water supply. ATEC systems provide treatment for groundwater addressing a wide range of contaminants including arsenic, hexavalent chromium, nitrates, and other groundwater constituents of concern.\n\n**_About ATEC_**\n\nATEC Water Systems, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cadiz, Inc.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal\npresentation.\nI will now turn the conference over to Courtney Degener, Vice President, Investor Relations of Cadiz. Thank\nyou. You may begin.\nCourtney Degener\nThank you and welcome to the Cadiz’s September 2024 Corporate Update Call, which will feature a status\nupdate on the business and project development by our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Susan Kennedy.\nDuring the conference call the Company will be making forward-looking statements regarding expectations\nfor future performance and business prospects. Forward-looking information involves risks and\nuncertainties, and the stated expectations could differ materially from actual results or performance. The\nCompany advises you to read and consider the Company’s SEC filings including its Second Quarter 2024\nForm 10-Q and 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of risk factors inherent to the\nbusiness and the Company.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events\nor circumstances that occur after the call.\nNow, I am pleased to introduce our Chairman and CEO Susan Kennedy.\nWith that, I’ll pass the call to Susan.\nSusan Kennedy\nThank you, Courtney, and thanks everyone for joining us today.\nDuring our initial Corporate Overview Call in May, I talked about Cadiz’s evolution - from a company with\n“one big water project” looking for “one big public agency customer”, to a company that is today in the right\nplace at the right time with the kind of water assets that allows us to produce a full suite of water solutions\nto more customers across a much larger market.\nIn today’s update call, I’ll provide a progress report on key milestones and a look ahead for any tailwinds\nor headwinds in the industry that might impact the company in the near and midterm.\nFirst, for investors who are new to the Company – a quick description of what “key milestones” for Cadiz\nCadiz, Inc. – September 2024 Corporate Update Call, September 19, 2024\nlook like:\nCadiz is an asset rich company – we have five major assets that alone or in combination can generate\nmore than $5 billion in cash flows – water supply, water storage, pipeline assets for water conveyance,\nwater filtration technology with our wholly-owned subsidiary ATEC Systems that can remove dangerous\nchemicals from groundwater like as arsenic, Chromium 6 and “PFAS” or “forever chemicals,” and we own\n45,000 acres of land with abundant sun and abundant water resources that we’ve been operating for\nagriculture for the last 40 years.\nIn the last quarter we reached a few key milestones –\nMost importantly, we signed another water supply purchase agreement with an investor-owned water\nutility that brings the total amount of water supply contracts for delivery via the Company’s Northern\nPipeline to 21,275 acre-feet per year. That represents 85% of the throughput capacity of the Northern\nPipeline.\nFor investors unfamiliar with our water supply assets – Cadiz holds water rights and permits to export 2.5\nmillion acre-feet of water from our ranch to regional water agencies over a 50 year period. That amounts\nto, on average, 50,000 acre-feet per year over 50 years. Our Northern Pipeline, which the Company\npurchased from El Paso Natural Gas in 2021, can transport 25,000 acre-feet per year, or half the total\nyield of the permitted water supply from our project.\nReaching the 85% contracted mark is important because these 40 and 50 year “take or pay” supply\ncontracts will generate the cash flows that support project financing for construction and generate annual\nrecurring revenue to the Company.\nI will talk more about the water supply agreements in a few minutes.\nSecond, in the last quarter our water filtration subsidiary, ATEC Water Systems, signed an additional $5\nmillion contract for filters for a water agency in Oregon. I will talk a bit more about ATEC in a minute.\nThird, we’ve made substantial progress in discussions with a number of public entities regarding formation\nof a Master Limited Partnership to finance an estimated $800 million in capital costs for the groundwater\nbanking project. I don’t have a lot of details to share today but we are in the diligence process with a\nnumber of large public and non-profit entities for equity investments in the MLP. More on that in a minute.\nAs a reminder, Cadiz has the only reliable new water supply in the Colorado River Basin and the largest\nnew groundwater storage banking opportunity in the Southwest. With hundreds of miles of pipeline assets,\nhalf of which are already in the ground, Cadiz is at the center of the entire Southwestern water network.\nAnd, we have what I believe is the most cost-effective groundwater treatment technology on the market\nNow, I will provide a few more details on each of those issues –\nThroughout 2024, we’ve focused on several important milestones including the execution of water supply\nagreements, new contracts for ATEC Systems, and progress toward securing project financing in an MLP\nstructure.\nAs I mentioned, in the last quarter, we signed our fifth definitive agreement for water supply from the Cadiz\nWater Supply and Storage Project for delivery through our Northern Pipeline. These agreements now\nrepresent 85% of the capacity of the Northern Pipeline, bringing the cumulative total acre-feet per year under\ncontract for to 21,275 acre-feet per year out of a total capacity for the Northern Pipeline of 25,000 acre-feet\nper year.\nCadiz, Inc. – September 2024 Corporate Update Call, September 19, 2024\nToday, we are in negotiation with other entities, both public water systems and commercial entities to reserve the\nremaining capacity of the Northern Pipeline and we are beginning discussions with public water systems\nfor water supply that would be delivered via the Southern Pipeline when that pipeline is constructed. We\nanticipate that we’ll have the Northern Pipeline fully committed by the end of 2024.\nThe water supply agreements we’ve signed to date, which are available for review in our SEC filings,\nrepresent our expectations of cumulative payments in excess of $1.2 billion over the life of those contracts\ngenerating an estimated gross cash flow of between $25 -$35 million per year with estimated net annual\nrevenue to the Company of approximately $16 million that begins when the Northern Pipeline becomes\noperational. When both pipelines are fully subscribed and operational, we estimate annual recurring cash\nflow to the Company from water supply contracts to be approximately $42 million per year in 2024 dollars\nand adjusted annually based on the BLS Water and Sewer Index.\nThese contracts are 40-year and 50-year take or pay contracts, so the cumulative total revenue from water\nsupply over the 50-year life of those contracts is expected to be approximately between $2 billion and $2.5\nbillion.\nWith regard to revenues from groundwater storage and banking operations, we expect significant interest\nin reservations for water storage to begin in 2025 and 2026, when our pipelines are operational and\nnegotiations among the Colorado River Basin states about the future of Colorado River water supplies\ngets real. With climate change, supplies from the River are expected to become even more unreliable\nmaking storage critically important.\nWhen fully operational our groundwater storage bank in the Mojave Desert will enable one million acre-\nfeet of storage in Southern California, which is larger than most surface reservoir in Southern California,\nand be accessible from multiple pipelines interconnecting our groundwater bank with the Colorado River\nsystem and the State Water Project system. And our groundwater bank is full – we have hundreds of\nyears of water already in storage – we do not need to wait for the next snowmelt to fill the storage bank –\nThis will allow our groundwater bank in the Mojave Desert to become the largest groundwater banking\noperation in the Southwestern U.S.\nWhat does that mean? A groundwater banking project that has the only new water supply in the Colorado\nRiver Basin means we can not only store imported water, we can lend water, lease water, advance water\nsupplies and trade or exchange water stored at Cadiz with water stored in other groundwater banks or\nLake Mead or in Northern California reservoirs.\nOur target date for having the groundwater storage and banking online is 2027 to coincide with the\nconclusion of the Colorado River negotiations.\nFor investors new to Cadiz who are not familiar with business models in the water industry, the revenue\nstream for groundwater storage is based upon a per acre-foot reservation fee, kind of like leasing a condo\nunit in a condo complex. Agencies with water supply to store during wet years would lease space in our\naquifer and also pay wheeling rates (like tolling fees) to use our pipelines to move water in and out of storage\nand pay us administration fees for managing their water in storage.\nThe market comps for groundwater storage banks in California today is approximately $1,500 per acre-foot\nof storage space. So the cumulative gross revenue from water storage over the 50-year life of our permit\nis estimated to be approximately $1.5 billion plus annual maintenance fees, plus any wheeling fees. Other\ngroundwater banking operations – such as trading or exchanging water supplies between third parties or\nproviding one-time emergency supplies – are different types of products that would generate additional\ncash flows over the life of the project.\nSo, we estimate cash flows from our existing permits for water supply, storage and banking operations to\nbe in excess of $5 billion.\nCadiz, Inc. – September 2024 Corporate Update Call, September 19, 2024\nWe are in active discussions now with half a dozen parties interested in providing the equity capital to\ndevelop this groundwater bank with us. I will talk about that a bit more when we get to project finance\ndiscussion\nWe’re also continuing to build a robust project pipeline for ATEC Water Systems, our wholly owned\nsubsidiary that designs, manufactures and maintains specialized water filtration systems to remove\ncontaminants like iron, manganese, arsenic from groundwater supply. What we really like about the\naddition of ATEC to our suite of water solutions is that we can pair water filtration with water supply\nproducts or water storage in ways that is accretive to both.\nMany of you already know, we acquired ATEC’s assets in 2022 for $2 million and forecast ATEC segment\noperating income in the range of $3 million to $3.5 million for 2024 based upon forecasted segment\nrevenues of approximately $15 million. In the last quarter we announced new awards including a $5 million\ncontract where ATEC will be manufacturing filter systems for the City of Gresham, Oregon, and three\nadditional sales contracts for iron and manganese filtration systems totaling an expected $1.5 million in\nsales revenue. We began shipping filters to fulfill our Utah contract in August and expect to complete\nshipment of the 320 filter for our $9 million contract in 2024. ATEC’s continued progress adds a lot of\nconfidence to our forecast and we’re very optimistic about the future of that new part of the Cadiz business.\nTurning to our project financing strategy.\nWe’ve developed a number of strategic partnerships and entered into agreements with public agency\npartners including the County of San Bernardino, that should make the project eligible for a significant\nshare of the federal and state grant funding, which for clean water projects alone is $55 billion through the\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act. We are actively working with our\npartners to develop grant applications to access those funds.\nAs previously disclosed, we are in advanced discussions with parties that would participate in establishing\na Master Limited Partnership (or MLP) financing structure to finance the approximately $800 million of\ncapital required to achieve full operation of the Mojave Groundwater Bank, including both the Northern\nPipeline Southern Pipeline. This includes $135 – $165 million in estimated costs for the Northern Pipeline\nconversion, an estimated $450 million in costs for construction of the Southern Pipeline and an estimated\n$100-$125 million in costs to build out the wellfield and groundwater banking facilities.\nWe believe forming this MLP entity could be the most advantageous structure to allow multiple public\nagency partners and investors to act as limited partners and commit equity capital toward the infrastructure\ncosts in exchange for an agreed-upon cash flow share of the expected revenues from storage. For\ninvestors unfamiliar with this industry, the MLP structure is typically used for development of pipeline and\nreal estate assets. Cadiz would establish a special purpose entity to act as General Partner and contribute\nour infrastructure assets to the partnership along with a share of the long-term cash flows from the\ngroundwater bank. In exchange, Limited Partners would commit the funding for project capital costs. The\nMLP structure is tax efficient and reduces the cost of water to end-users – a win for investors, the\nCompany, and the communities benefiting from clean and secure water supplies.\nWe have made significant progress over the summer towards our goal of establishing the MLP and\nsecuring commitments of Limited Partners to put the infrastructure financing in place. We will provide more\ndetails as this process moves forward. But we are optimistic about achieving our goals of having project\nfinancing in place this year, beginning conversion of the Northern Pipeline for water delivery in 2026, and\nhaving the Southern Pipeline and groundwater storage bank operational in 2027.\nLast point before I turn to questions, you may have seen the announcement this morning of the\nappointment of Cathryn Rivera as our new Chief Operating Officer. Cathryn most recently served for five\nyears in the administration of California Governor Gavin Newsom and she is, I believe she is the most\neffective operational leader I have ever worked with. I am really excited she’s agreed to join the team as\nCadiz, Inc. – September 2024 Corporate Update Call, September 19, 2024\nwe hit this inflection point in our plans to scale up our operations.\nWrapping up, we will now turn to the Q&A segment, and I’m going to turn it over to the operator to begin\nby answering questions that have been submitted in advance and then try to get to as many new questions\nas we can in the time we have.\nOver to you.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. We will begin the question-and-\nanswer session by answering, first, previously submitted questions. Live questions may be submitted by\nusing the Q&A icon at the bottom of your screen.\nI will now turn the call back over to Courtney to moderate the Q&A portion of the call. Courtney, please\nproceed.\nCourtney Degener\nThank you. Susan, the first question is, as a long-term investor it feels like the last big unknowns are with\npipeline construction financing. Can we get adequate financing to complete the pipelines, and what will it\ncost? Can you elaborate, please?\nSusan Kennedy\nAs I mentioned during my remarks, we think the estimated cost of the construction for the entire project is\nabout $800 million. We believe that we have the right structure in place with a MLP structure, and we are\nin discussions with a number of interested parties to come in and they are public entities, nonprofit entities,\ngovernment entities that can serve as investors but also will be able to attract and make the project eligible\nfor maximum amounts of grant funding that’s being offered by federal and state government agencies for\nprojects just like this. So we think we’re in the right place and moving in the right direction, and we’ve very\noptimistic about being able to secure the capital required.\nCourtney Degener\nThank you. Next question: Please tell us more about the CDZIP preferred? What will be happening with it?\nSusan Kennedy\nThe preferreds can be redeemed at par. I think it’s in June 2025—and Stan will correct me if I am wrong.\nWhen the Company is in a strong cash position, we would expect to redeem those. There’s no mandatory\nredeemable date on the preferred, so it’s entirely our option if and when we redeem, but we’ll make that\ndecision when the company is in a strong cash position.\nCourtney Degener\nThank you. Next question: Are there any administrative hurdle maneuvers left that the environmental lobby\ncan use to delay or derail any of the pipeline projects?\nSusan Kennedy\nCadiz, Inc. – September 2024 Corporate Update Call, September 19, 2024\nWell, as I’ve said at every meeting and discussion we’ve had, I wake up every day since the day I joined\nthe company dreaming of ways that it could be delayed. I can’t think of any ways. I cannot think of any ways\nthat it could be delayed at this point.\nCourtney Degener\nThank you. With your latest announcement of the northern pipeline capacity at 85% under contract, will you\ndiscuss the current status or timeline to completion of this important milestone to reach 100% of capacity\nunder contract? Will achievement of this milestone effectively activate the project financing and grant\nfunding, or what would be the next step?\nSusan Kennedy\nIf there’s 21,750 out of 25,000, so there’s just over 3,000 acre-feet available left for this firm capacity on the\nnorthern pipeline. Reaching 85% is sort of a magic number for us because it gives us the critical mass in\nwater supply contracts that we need in order to be able to support the project financing, so I’m not worried\nabout closing the last 3,000/4,000. There’s plenty of interest, and our announcement that we reached 85%\ngenerated some interest in moving a little bit more quickly, so I’m not worried about closing that. It's actually\nstarted discussions with agencies about capacity that will be available on the southern pipeline, so we’re\nmoving in that direction as well.\nCourtney Degener\nOkay. Thank you. Next question is regarding the MLP structure. Will you elaborate on the MLP structure\nthat we are targeting for project financing, particularly in terms of the partners we’ve identified and the\ncurrent stage of discussions that would lead us to ensure financing is committed by the end of 2024?\nSusan Kennedy\nI can’t disclose exactly who we’re in discussions with at the moment, but there’s been a lot of discussions\nabout the type of entities we’ve been working with over the past three years. County of San Bernardino is\none that actually voted to sign up and be part of the financing entity through the Joint Powers Authority that\nwe established. We’ve also been working with Native American tribes, and we’ve been working with a lot\nof the local communities, the disadvantaged communities that have an interest in water supply. More\nimportantly, they have an interest in seeing the infrastructure built that can serve their area. So we believe\nwe’ve put together a coalition of public entity partners that have a very strong interest in getting the\ninfrastructure built and they will be able to attract maximum funding that’s available through state and\nfederal grant programs.\nWhat makes this different is that in the water world, in the water industry, these types of infrastructure\nprojects are usually built by utilities and the utilities pass their costs on to the consumers, their rate payers,\nand so they are incentivized to build the smallest assets, the smallest pipelines possible just to carry their\nwater for their customers and sometimes it’s hundreds of miles from where the source is to where their\ncustomers are, and that process takes many, many years and it’s very, very expensive.\nThis structure, with the limited partners and with these public entities coming in as investors and sharing in\nthe proceeds of the project, it is very cost effective in terms of it doesn’t waste a lot of money on borrowing\ncosts for these agencies. But also, it has very attractive returns because they’re backed by take or pay\ncontracts. So this is uniquely applied to the water industry, but I think it’s very groundbreaking and really\nopens the door to value engineering the design of the water infrastructure to maximize operation of the\nassets and the revenues. So I think it’s very beneficial to the company to be spearheading this type of\nstructure.\nCourtney Degener\nCadiz, Inc. – September 2024 Corporate Update Call, September 19, 2024\nThank you. Following today’s executive management announcement about Cathryn Rivera Hernandez as\nCOO, can you please elaborate on your expectations for her role, primary function and any measures of\nher performance for the newly created position?\nSusan Kennedy\nWell, I think the title says it all, Chief Operating Officer. We are at the scale point where we’ve got multiple\noperations that are having to staff up and scale up simultaneously and I don’t know anyone better who can\nkeep the trains running and the plane flying than Cathryn Rivera. It’s really going to be running the day-to-\nday operations of the company, which has a lot of different project development aspects, finance aspects,\ncorporate aspects, our subsidiaries. There’s a lot of things going on and this is the first of a number of\nexpansions that I expect we’ll be looking at in the near future.\nCourtney Degener\nPerfect. That leads into a question we received about ATEC, as well. Can you tell us a little bit more about\nthe technology and what are you most excited about with the ATEC system opportunity?\nSusan Kennedy\nI am not an expert to be talking about the technology, but I know enough to be dangerous. What I was really\nexcited about acquiring this technology because groundwater cleanup is an enormous opportunity. It’s an\nenormous problem. The magnitude of the problem, because of climate change and now communities are\ndealing more with stormwater than they are with snowmelt and that causes a lot of problems in terms of\ngroundwater treatment to be able to turn that into potable use for drinking water. So this is an enormous,\nmultibillion dollar worldwide problem, and this company had a unique set of assets that we tested on our\nown ranch because we had elevated levels of Chromium 6 long before Chromium 6 was really on the radar.\nBut it’s naturally occurring and this was the most cost effective treatment so we use the same medium to\naddress different constituents of concern. So, iron and manganese, arsenic, Chromium 6, and we designed\nthe filters for that and their system is very low—much lower cost than some of the big operators that are\nout there. So it gives us access to parts of the market, but it’s very, very hard for others to compete in that\nspace. On a standalone basis, it’s a really good opportunity for us addressing a very real-world issue in a\nlot of communities that don’t have access to clean water.\nBut it’s also by pairing water treatment with water supply, or even with we have pipeline access, it’s an\nattractant in terms of value add for all these different water agencies that need to figure out how to address\nChromium 6 and forever chemicals that are in their groundwater today. So it just puts us in a really good\nposition.\nCourtney Degener\nThank you. I am not seeing any further questions, so would you like to make any closing remarks?\nSusan Kennedy\nI want to thank everybody. I think those of you who have been with Cadiz for a long time, we’ve got 20\nyears of project development behind us in the rearview mirror, and we’ve got a tremendous opportunity in\nfront of us and I think the Company is in the best possible position it could be in, and I’m so excited about\nwhat the next 12 months are going to bring. Thank you.\nOperator\nCadiz, Inc. – September 2024 Corporate Update Call, September 19, 2024\nThank you. That concludes today’s conference. We will now close the call."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal\npresentation.\nI will now turn the conference over to Courtney Degener, Vice President, Investor Relations of Cadiz. Thank\nyou. You may begin.\nCourtney Degener\nThank you and welcome to the Cadiz Corporate Update Call. On the call today we have our CEO, Susan\nKennedy and our CFO, Stan Speer.\nDuring the conference call the Company will be making forward-looking statements regarding expectations\nfor future performance and business prospects. Forward-looking information involves risks and\nuncertainties, and the stated expectations could differ materially from actual results or performance. The\nCompany advises you to read and consider the Company’s SEC filings including its 2023 Annual Report\non Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024, for a detailed discussion of risk factors inherent to the\nbusiness and the Company.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events\nof circumstances that occur after the call.\nNow, I am pleased to introduce our Chairman and CEO Susan Kennedy, who first joined the Board in 2021,\nwas then elected Chair in 2022, and appointed to serve as Chairman and CEO effective January 1 of this\nyear. Susan has built a successful career bridging politics, government and the private sector, with\nparticular focus on the energy and water industries, and we are happy to have her at the helm.\nWith that, I’ll pass the call to Susan.\nSusan Kennedy\nThanks Courtney, and thanks everyone for joining us today. This is the first time in many years that we’re\nhosting a call like this, and I look forward to walking you through the Cadiz of today and what I’m looking\nmost forward to as the CEO.\n1\nCadiz, Inc. – Corporate Investor Overview Call, May 16, 2024\nWhen I joined the Board a few years ago I felt like I was handed the football on the five-yard line. Twenty\nyears ago, Cadiz was one big water project looking for one big public agency customer at a time when\nnobody needed water. Today, Cadiz is an asset-rich company with exactly the right combination of water\nsupply, storage infrastructure and treatment technologies to address what I believe is the greatest climate\nchallenge the world will face in the next decade – access to clean water. And because here in the Southwest\nwe’re in one of the most water insecure regions of the world, Cadiz is better positioned today than ever\nbefore to monetize these assets.\nFor those of you who don’t know me, let me give you a little bit of background on myself. I spent most of\nmy career in politics and government in California as Chief of Staff to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,\nas Cabinet Secretary to Governor Greg Davis, as a commissioner on the California Public Utilities\nCommission, the body that regulates the state’s investor-owned gas, water and electric utilities. I also\nserved as communications director for U.S. Senator, Dianne Feinstein. In those roles I acquired a unique\nskill set in bringing in the biggest, hairiest infrastructure projects through the financial, political and\nregulatory gauntlet and driving them across the goal line.\nI was responsible for negotiating some of the most complex agreements amongst stakeholder groups,\nindustry leaders, environmentalists, cities, counties, Native American tribes, and developing hundreds of\nbillions of dollars in infrastructure projects for energy, water supply, transportation, telecommunications,\netc.\nNow, if you’re familiar with getting anything built in California, it’s no surprise that it takes twenty years to\nget any major project through the permitting process. And you face years of litigation over the permits once\nthey’re issued. That’s standard operating procedure. Water without a doubt is the most controversial issue\nof all in California’s famed ‘whiskey is for drinking, water is for fighting’ words. It involves the greatest\nnumber of combatants, stakeholders, politicians and lawyers.\nSo, for the last few decades, as a company Cadiz was solely focused on trying to find customers for a very\nlarge water supply and storage project in the Mojave Desert. One big project looking for one big customer\nand, like all projects in California that face torrid opposition. Cadiz is different today. We’re a different\ncompany. And to understand where we are today, it’s important to understand two things:\n One, the intrinsic value of the assets we developed since the Company was founded in 1983.\n Two, the context as to what’s happening in the water industry around the world today that makes\nthese assets in combination so much more valuable today than at any other time in the Company’s\nhistory. I’d like to give you a very brief overview on those issues.\nThe Company’s founder spent the first 15 years developing our land and water assets in the early 1980s.\nThey used satellite imaging from NASA to identify areas in Southern California where they believed they\nwould find prolific water resources underground. They began acquiring land, thousands of acres, and\nknitting these parcels together through land swaps with railroad and the federal government to create Cadiz\nRanch, 46,000 acres of mostly contiguous land with prolific natural water resources located in one of the\nmost unlikely places in the world you would expect to find water, the Mojave Desert.\nThe Company then spent the next 20 years investing in the land, building out the well fields, operating the\nlargest farming operation in the country, vesting the water rights, slogging through the permit process to\nallow them to export water supply and successfully defending those permits through many years of\nlitigation.\nToday, with our water supply permits secured and successful litigation behind us, we’re looking at the 20\nyears it takes to build any major project in California in the rearview mirror.\n2\nCadiz, Inc. – Corporate Investor Overview Call, May 16, 2024\nBut the most important thing the Company did in the last 10 years or so is acquire critical infrastructure\nassets, hundreds of miles of pipeline, rights of way to build new pipeline, water filtration technology, and\nwe’ve made strategic capital investments in what we believe will enable us to bring these assets online in\nan expedited timeframe and build what we believe will be one of the largest water storage and trading banks\nin the Southwestern United States.\nNow, with climate change’s recent havoc on water supplies and the acquisition of pipelines and treatment\ntechnology that we can integrate with that water supply and storage solution, Cadiz now has what I believe\nare the most valuable water assets in the Southwestern U.S. and we’re in a position to monetize them in\nways that, frankly, weren’t even possible just a few years ago.\nNow, I want to take just a couple of minutes to walk you through the context of what is happening in the\nwater industry today and why our assets are so uniquely valuable.\nThe entire water industry around the world is facing massive disruption because of climate change. The\nnew reality facing 40 million people in the southwestern United States is that the Colorado River is\noversubscribed, in distress, and Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the U.S., is no longer reliable in severe\ndrought conditions. Thirty percent of Southern California’s water supply comes from the Colorado River.\nAnother 50% comes from Northern California through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which is also in\ndistress. Cadiz’s core asset is an aquifer system that flows under our land, part of a 2,000 square mile\nwatershed system covering 1.2 million acres. That’s estimated to hold as much as 30 to 50 million acre feet\nof water and storage today. To put that in context, Lake Mead, the largest surface reservoir in the U.S., 250\nsquare miles, 160,000 acres, has a maximum storage capacity of 28 million acre feet of water. There is\nmore water and storage today at Cadiz than there is in Lake Mead and Lake Powell, two of the largest\nreservoirs in the U.S., combined.\nSo, where does the water come from? The watershed system that feeds the Cadiz aquifers and collecting\nwater with snow and rain in surrounding mountains for thousands of years. In fact, it takes 1,000 years for\nsnow that fell in the New York Mountains at the top of the watershed to make its way down to Fenner Gap\nwhere Cadiz Ranch sits. So, there’s a 1,000-year uninterruptible water supply feeding the aquifer that flows\nbeneath Cadiz Ranch.\nOur water rights with permits from the county allow us to withdraw 2.5 million acre feet of water from the\naquifer over a 50-year period. We currently use our groundwater for agricultural purposes, but in 2012 we\nreceived permits to export 50,000 acre feet of water per year from the Cadiz property and make this new\nwater supply available to communities in Southern California. That’s up to the 2.5 million acre feet over 50\nyears.\nThe permits to export water were controversial. We went through years of litigation, but they were upheld\nin court and are fully vested today.\nMore importantly, the geology of the Cadiz aquifer allows us to import an additional 1 million acre feet of\nsurface water from the Colorado River or potentially the state water project and store it underground in our\naquifer without any loss through evaporation.\nWhen our project is fully online, Cadiz will be the largest new groundwater storage bank in the Southwestern\nU.S. and we believe we are extremely well positioned to address this new climate reality.\nOur water bank has many years of water in it. We don’t have to pray for snow every winter in order to fill\nthe aquifer. And the truth is, we don’t have a water scarcity problem. We have the same amount of water\non the planet today that we’ve had for 4 billion years. Water doesn’t evaporate and leave the planet. The\nproblem is snow. Our entire water storage and conveyance system was designed around steady,\npredictable snowpack and the scary fact is we’re losing our snowpack.\n3\nCadiz, Inc. – Corporate Investor Overview Call, May 16, 2024\nFor the last 75 years, despite occasional blizzard years, there’s been a steady decline in the snowpack in\nthe Rocky Mountains, in both the California Sierras and in the Rocky Mountains. The trendline is not\nchanging. Climate scientists today are suggesting that in 25 years California could lose its snowpack in the\nSierra Nevada Mountains. Half of the water supply for California comes from snowpack and snow melt, and\nthe reality is the entire water industry, which was built on billions of dollars in infrastructure investments, is\nbased on a steady, predictable hydrological cycle that no longer exists. Extreme is the new normal.\nSince about 1980, the weather cycle has changed from steady going back to like the 1800s, to this\ncompletely unpredictable whiplash event from extreme drought to extreme weather in the states of about a\nmatter of months. So, what we see in the future is rain and this is where climate change becomes an\ninfrastructure problem.\nWe’re losing our snowpack in the North because precipitation and the snow melt are now moving to the\nSouth. The vast majority of our water reservoir storage was built in the North. So, Northern California where\nthe Sierra Nevadas and the Cascade Mountains are, our ageing water system was designed to capture\nsteady Sierra snow melt, not rain from atmospheric rivers, and flash floods that are today’s climate reality.\nThis is an urgent problem happening around the world due to climate change.\nNow, when you look at where Cadiz is located and you understand the value of our asset, we have the only\nreliable new water supply in the Colorado River Basin. We have the largest new groundwater storage bank\nin the Southwest. We have hundreds of miles of pipeline assets, half of which are already in the ground,\nthat can connect us to the entire Southern California water network, and we have what I believe is the most\ncost effective treatment technology on the market, and strategically located at the center of one of the most\nwater insecure regions in the U.S., I think you can understand why Cadiz is positioned today to offer a\nrange of solutions across a much bigger market, making Cadiz a very different company today than it was\n20 years ago.\nWhere we are today.\nWe closed a very important financing in the first quarter with our largest investor, Heerema, providing the\nCompany with working capital that allows us to focus on infrastructure financing, project development on\nan expedited timeframe.\nWe announced execution of several water supply agreements with public water systems and one housing\ndeveloper in Q1. These agreements represent 65% of the capacity of the Northern Pipeline, which is 25,000\nacre feet per year, and we’re in advanced stages of negotiation with other public water systems to purchase\nthe remaining capacity of the Northern Pipeline.\nThe water supply agreements we’ve signed to date, which are available for review in our SEC filings,\nrepresent the expected cumulative payments in excess of $1.2 billion over the life of those contracts with\nan estimated net annual revenue of approximately $16 million to the Company that begins when the\nNorthern Pipeline becomes operational. When both pipelines are fully subscribed and operational, we\nexpect net revenues, annual recurring cash flow to the Company from water supply contracts to be\napproximately $45 million per year in 2024 dollars, and adjusted annually based on the BLS Water and\nSewer Index.\nOur contracts are 40-year and 50-year take or pay contracts, so the cumulative total revenue from water\nsupply over the 50-year life of those contracts is expected to be approximately between $2 billion and $2.5\nbillion.\nWith regard to revenues from groundwater storage, we expect to start seeing reservations for storage in\nabout 2026. Maybe earlier, but utilizing groundwater storage is dependent upon having enough pipeline\ncapacity to move water in and out of storage, so we expect reservations for storage to happen closer to the\ntime when our pipelines become operational.\n4\nCadiz, Inc. – Corporate Investor Overview Call, May 16, 2024\nThe revenue water for groundwater storage is based upon a per acre foot reservation fee, kind of like\nleasing a condo unit in a condo complex. Agencies with water supply to store during wet years would lease\nspace in our aquifer and pay wheeling rates to use our pipelines to move water in and out of storage during\ndry years.\nThe market comps for groundwater storage banks in California today is approximately $1,500 per acre foot\nof storage space. So the cumulative total, gross revenue from water storage over the 50-year life of our\npermit is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion including annual maintenance fees and wheeling fees.\nOne of the most important things the Company has accomplished in this last year is developing strategic\npartnerships with public agencies. We’ve entered into agreements with a number of public agency partners\nincluding the County of San Bernardino, that should make the project eligible for a significant share of the\nfederal and state grant funding made available for climate and water resiliency projects, and we expect to\nbe working with our partners to generate grant applications to access those funds beginning the second\nhalf of this year.\nOur main focus today is working with those partners to put the infrastructure financing in place along with\nthe grant funding that will support our capital expenditures necessary to bring the Northern Pipeline online.\nOur target date is 2026 for the Northern Pipeline and the Southern Pipeline online with a target date of\n2027.\nWe’re continuing to build out the project pipeline for ATEC Water Systems, our wholly owned subsidiary.\nATEC designs, manufactures and maintains specialized water filtration systems to remove contaminants\nlike iron, manganese, arsenic from groundwater supply. We’re very bullish on the potential to scale\ndeployment of ATEC as a groundwater—groundwater is a huge growing concern around the world.\nWe acquired ATEC’s assets in 2022 for $2 million and forecast ATEC segment operating income in the\nrange of $3 million to $3.5 million for 2024 based upon forecasted ATEC segment revenues of\napproximately $15 million.\nIn case you missed it, we announced the award of a new $5 million contract earlier this week where ATEC\nwill be manufacturing filter systems for the City of Gresham, Oregon outside of Portland.\nI think at this point we’re going to turn to the Q&A section of the prepared program, and I’m going to turn it\nover to the operator for a minute and then I’m going to take some—we have questions submitted in advance\nthat we’re going to answer those and then try to get to as many new questions we can in the time we have.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. We will begin the question-and-\nanswer session by answering previously submitted questions. If time permits, there may be an opportunity\nto answer questions from the live webcast participants.\nYou may submit questions by using the Q&A icon at the bottom of your screen. You may need to hover\nyour mouse in the Zoom program for the icon to appear. Thank you.\nSusan Kennedy\nThank you. I’m going to go through some of the questions that we’ve got in advance and be my own\nmoderator here.\nFirst one: When did you purchase the gas pipeline and does it need to be cleaned or retrofitted to\ntransport water, and how much water can be transported through the pipeline?\n5\nCadiz, Inc. – Corporate Investor Overview Call, May 16, 2024\nThe Company completed the purchase of the 220-mile Northern Pipeline from El Paso Natural Gas in June\nof 2021. It was originally built for oil. It was cleaned and converted to transport natural gas, but it was never\nput into service for gas. So, we believe we will be the first in the world to convert a fossil fuel pipeline to\ntransport water. Once converted, the pipeline will be able to carry 25,000 acre feet for water per year across\nhundreds of miles, including areas of the state that don’t have access to reliable water supplies today.\nAny concerns on future political opposition?\nNone. There will always be opposition to water projects, but our permits went through a decade of litigation.\nThere are no more appeals available. Also, everything has changed during the last severe drought that\ncrippled the Southwest.\nPolitical opposition to new water supply projects has been toned down quite a bit since the massive drought\nwe had a couple of years ago, and water from the Cadiz project is going to go to serve some of the poorest\ncommunities in the state. So the politics around access to clean water have changed dramatically in the\nlast few years, so I don’t have a lot of concern over political opposition.\nWhat are the two or three things stopping you from transporting water today and what are the\nactions being taken to remove those obstacles?\nMy job is to wake up every single day and think about what could stop this project, and then make sure\nthose obstacles don’t exist. I would say there’s nothing stopping us today. The obstacle course that we’re\non now is identifying the best infrastructure financing with the right public agency partner so that we can\nbuild with the lowest cost of capital and get equipment and materials ordered, some of which have a nine-\nmonth lead time and all of which take cash.\nI believe we have great public partners and we’re in detailed discussions now on a financing structure. Any\nmajor infrastructure or project like ours involves a labyrinth of environmental review and permits from\nbeginning to end of construction, and that Cadiz has the most critical permits we need in hand, namely our\nwater supply permits and the ownership of the pipeline asset.\nThe remainder of the environmental reviews and permits that we will need to convert the gas pipeline to\nwater, import surface water into storage, construct the pumping stations, those are all going to be led by\nthe public agencies that have signed up to be our partners. So we’re in standard operating procedure now\nand the standard permitting process and I don’t see headwinds.\nIn terms of the construction of the Southern Pipeline, do you require new permits from the Bureau\nof Land Management, and when do you expect this section of the pipeline to transport water?\nThe answer is no, we don’t need new permits. We purchased a 99-year lease within an existing right-of-\nway owned by the Arizona and California Railroad. That will allow us to build large pipelines to connect to\nthe Colorado River in the South. We do not need new permits to build within the railroad’s existing right-of-\nway. We’re targeting construction to begin in 2026; with the pipeline online we’re targeting for 2027.\nI am new to the Cadiz story. What should I be looking for in the immediate term to understand the\nprogress and the success of the company?\nThe most visible sign of progress are the water supply agreements and partnerships that we’re entering,\nwhich are filed with the SEC or announced in a press release. Most of these agreements take many, many\nmonths, even years, to negotiate, and the negotiation happens between agencies and behind closed doors.\nSo by the time you see Cadiz announce a new partnership with a city or a county, or a public agency that\nsigns up to participate in the Cadiz project, it means we’re moving the ball forward in terms of getting to\ndevelopment and construction.\n6\nCadiz, Inc. – Corporate Investor Overview Call, May 16, 2024\nThe real inflection point for us was in Q1 of this year when we announced the first signed contract with\nagencies for water supply via the Northern Pipeline. We now have 65% of the Northern Pipeline fully\ncontracted and we’re expecting to finish negotiations on the remaining capacity in the foreseeable future.\nThose are the revenue streams that will support the infrastructure financing.\nI think the other mile marker to look for is the ATEC Pipeline. We’ve won more than a dozen bids in the last\nyear. We just increased ATEC’s full segment year revenue guidance from $12 million to $15 million. We’re\nvery optimistic about the potential to scale the ATEC business. Also, it diversifies our revenue stream.\nWhen did you acquire ATEC Systems and how does that fit into your portfolio of water supply and\nstorage assets?\nWe acquired ATEC as ATEC Systems in 2022. ATEC manufactures filtration systems that treat iron,\nmanganese, arsenic, nitrates, other constituents of concern. So, ATEC for us is a two-pronged growth\ndriver. First, we believe we have the most cost effective standalone solution in the industry and we see\nsubstantial accretive value in offering customers and all-in-one solution by integrating ATEC Systems into\nour water supply agreements.\nSecond is, as a standalone business segment with a growing project pipeline, ATEC diversifies the Cadiz\nrevenue stream. Some industry estimates say the market for water filtration technology is projected to grow\nup to $84 billion by 2030 because of the growing need for safe clean drinking water worldwide.\nWhat is the addressable market for Cadiz?\nWell, the immediate market for Cadiz water supply is through the water agencies that serve populations in\nSouthern California, primarily in the Inland Empire – San Bernardino and Riverside County. California’s\nInland Empire and the High Desert regions are some of the fastest growing areas of the state. They’re\nlimited in terms of access to existing water infrastructure, and they are ones that have the most benefit\nfrom—immediate benefit from the Cadiz project.\nOur water banking capabilities will allow us to trade or exchange for water and store water for water\nrightsholders throughout Southern California and potentially other parts of the Southwest including Arizona\nand Nevada.\nOur ATEC business is scalable anywhere and we’re presently focused on serving the western U.S. market\n– California, Utah, Oregon, etc.\nCan you frame the competitive landscape for Cadiz?\nI’d say today there’s no direct competitors to Cadiz. Water supply, storage and conveyance, they’re all very\nlocation specific markets in terms of supply and demand, and they require physical assets that take decades\nto build. We have physical assets that, A, can’t be replicated, and B, allow us to meet local demand at a\nlower cost than other water resources that have to be pumped in from hundreds of miles away.\nIn the water filtration market, there are lots of competitors, especially in the mid system to large system\nspace, but the feedback we’re getting is that ATEC is hands down the most cost effective technology on\nthe market and one of the only companies that can scale down to meet demand in small water community\nsystems at a cost that is reasonable. We just did that in the Torrez Martinez Indian Reservation down in the\nCoachella Valley. We custom-built the systems for that and we showed that it can be done very cost\neffectively.\n7\nCadiz, Inc. – Corporate Investor Overview Call, May 16, 2024\nWhat is Cadiz’s current revenue source and the revenue opportunity by asset?\nCurrently we generate revenues from two business segments. The Company’s largest segment is Land\nand Water Resources. It comprises all activities regarding our properties in the Eastern Mojave, including\ndevelopment of the water project, which is supply, storage and conveyance, and our agricultural operations.\nThe Company’s second revenue segment is its water filtration technology business, that’s ATEC, which\nwe’ve discussed. It manufactures, services and maintains filtration systems for impaired groundwater\nresources.\nOn our ATEC filtration business, as we mentioned earlier, we revised our ATEC segment gross revenue\nforecast for the year from $12 million for the full year to $15 million for 2024.\nWe will generate revenue from storage and the supply side of our business once the pipelines are built and\noperational. We’re targeting the Northern Pipeline to be online in 2026, Southern Pipeline in 2027, and\naccordingly, this is the timeframe when we expect to generate revenues from those segments of the\nbusiness.\nFor illustrative purposes, let me explain how the supply contracts work. So, we’ve contracted 65% of the\nNorthern Pipeline to water agencies. They’re purchasing water through an annual take or pay contract for\nfirm supply delivery. The supply contract will deliver gross payments from each water agency estimated to\nbe up to $1,600 per acre foot per year. Some portion of that $1.600 payment will go to pay the capital costs\nof the infrastructure and the O&M costs of operating the pipeline. Cadiz expects to receive approximately\n$850 per acre foot per year as its revenue. For context, our permit allows us to export 50,000 acre feet per\nyear from our water supply. So when both pipelines are operational, we’re expecting about $45 million a\nyear in annual revenue from water supply sales. Those are 2024 dollars. The net price per acre foot to\nCadiz will increase annually based upon an inflator, the BLS Water and Sewer Index, which historically has\naveraged approximately 5% per annum.\nSecond, water storage is contracted to customers on a per acre foot basis, like leasing units in a condo\ncomplex. For example, agencies with rights to Colorado River water would lease space in our aquifer and\nstore their water in wet years and take it out of storage in dry years. We can store a million acre feet of\nwater and the comps in the market today for water storage is approximately $1,500 per acre foot of storage.\nQuick back-of-the-envelope calculation: a million acre feet of storage at $1,500 per acre foot adds up to\n$1.5 billion in gross payments for water storage. Agencies moving water in and out of water storage would\nalso pay a wheeling fee for using our pipelines, very similar to you would pay like a toll, a toll road for\ntransporting the water.\nOur storage customers or anybody with water rights, typically they’re large public utilities such as local\nwater districts, investor-owned utilities, regional water wholesalers and some large private water\nrightsholders including Native American tribes.\nCan you talk about Heerema and their role in providing project financing. Can you elaborate on the\nterms? What do you expect Heerema’s role to be going forward?\nHeerema has been a great partner. They’re our largest investor and together we’ve closed a number of\nfinancings to provide the operating capital we need as we’re racing to bring these projects online. We expect\nthem to continue to be supportive. They’re all-in on the Company.\nOne more minute left. In terms of the Northern and Southern Pipelines, please give us your estimated\ncapital requirements and timeline required to complete construction operational status.\nAs I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we’re targeting 2026/2027 for the pipelines to come online. The\ntotal capital requirements will be in the $700 million to $800 million range. We’ve taken a strategic approach\n8\nCadiz, Inc. – Corporate Investor Overview Call, May 16, 2024\nto capital planning and we’ve partnered with public agencies to be able to access the lowest cost of capital;\nthat will include billions of dollars in federal and state grant funding that’s available now. The financing\nsources will be based upon the resources available to the individual participating agency public agency\npartners. Most important, there’s more than $55 billion available for clean water climate resiliency projects\nthrough the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the availability of grant funding and low-interest\nloans has never been higher. So, our public agency partners are eligible for all of those dollars and we’re\ndeveloping the project finance mechanisms to allows us to access those billions of dollars in publicly\navailable grant funding.\nAll right, I think that is pretty much the end of our time, unless my team tells me there’s more questions,\ncomments. I think we are—anything we did not get to in terms of the questions, we will get to and answer\nindividually as fast as we can over the next couple of days.\nWith that, I think we will wrap it up.\nOperator\nThank you. We will now conclude today’s call. Thank you for your participation. All parties may now\ndisconnect. Thank you.\nFollow-up question submitted post call\nCan you discuss your asset value and what the make up of the assets are?\nIf you look at each revenue generating asset we have today – water supply, groundwater banking (storage)\ncapacity, pipelines, filtration technology – the total cash flows that can be generated with these assets over\nthe life of the assets is over $5 billion. Supply contracts alone can generate $2 - $3 billion; Supply contracts\nplus water filtration can generate additional cash flows. Storage alone can generate $1.5-$2 billion. Storage\nplus wheeling, trading, exchanges can generate additional cash flow as well. When the groundwater bank\nis fully operational we expect to be able to trade water on a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio, engage in spot market sales,\nand create new water products – such as hedging instruments, water quality blending products, emergency\nsupplies – (Note-the Bureau of Reclamation offered $650/AF for emergency supplies to restore Lake Mead\nwater levels in 2022). Plus, we believe we can scale our ATEC business for standalone systems.\n9"
