Interim CEO, Blair Jordan, Issues Letter to Stockholders; Provides Update on Newly Acquired Gaming Technology Platform\")\n\n**PALO ALTO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / October 16, 2024 /** 180 Life Sciences Corp. (NASDAQ:ATNF)(\"180\" or the \"Company\"), today released the following letter to stockholders from its Interim Chief Executive Officer, Blair Jordan.\n\nDear Stockholders:\n\nWe are excited to announce that 180 is planning to strategically enter into the online gaming industry, utilizing its newly acquired \"back-end\" gaming platform, which incorporates blockchain technology and full cryptocurrency operability (the \"Gaming Technology Platform\"). The Company plans to use this technology platform to establish a blockchain-based business aimed at the global iGaming market. Initially focusing on B2C (business-to-consumer) online casinos, the Company also plans to expand into a B2B (business-to-business) model, offering a seamless blockchain-enabled technology platform for gaming operators worldwide. In addition, management has identified certain global iGaming industry characteristics and trends that they believe make potential acquisition opportunities attractive. Management believes that the combination of the Gaming Technology Platform and the strength of a Nasdaq listing make the Company an attractive consolidation vehicle for the iGaming industry, and plan to work to identify potential acquisitions (although no targets exist at present).\n\n**A._The Gaming Technology Platform_** The Gaming Technology Platform includes advanced components designed to support online casinos using blockchain technology. These components are as follows:\n\n  1. **Blockchain Casino Operations Back-End** : A robust infrastructure designed to support casino game programming through secure and scalable server/cloud solutions, database management, and blockchain payment processing.\n\n  2. **Blockchain to FIAT Seamless Exchange Technology** : A proprietary system allowing players to deposit and withdraw using cryptocurrency, while maintaining FIAT-based wallets and gaming sessions. We believe that this cutting-edge technology offers a significant competitive advantage in the growing blockchain casino market.\n\n  3. **Blockchain API Technology** : A sophisticated application program interface (API) that facilitates reliable FIAT-to-blockchain and blockchain-to-FIAT payment gateways, supporting credit cards, e-wallets, and multiple cryptocurrencies while enabling blockchain-exclusive online casino operations.\n\n  4. **Player Account Management** : A secure system for managing player accounts, including registration, login, and player profiles, alongside know-your-client (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance features.\n\n  5. **Loyalty Systems for Blockchain Users** : A customer relationship management system designed to foster player loyalty and enhance the lifetime value of each customer by catering to blockchain users.\n\n  6. **Affiliate Tracking System** : A tool to monitor traffic, registrations, and referral sources, allowing for scalable growth through affiliate partnerships and the distribution of referral fees and royalties.\n\n\n\n\nAt the heart of the acquisition of the Gaming Technology Platform is proprietary source code, as well as specialized implementation know-how, much of which will be transferred from the seller to 180, as detailed below. Management intends to further develop both the proprietary source code, enhancing and expanding the commercial potential of the Gaming Technology Platform, as well as continue to build expertise in the operation of the Gaming Technology Platform. Management believes that the existing Gaming Technology Platform, plus future potential enhancements, provide a strong competitive barrier, and position the Company well as the iGaming industry moves towards both greater cryptocurrency acceptance, and the safety of blockchain enabled platforms.\n\n**B._Industry Background_** The global iGaming casino market has rapidly ascended as a major player in the digital entertainment industry, experiencing remarkable growth fueled by technological advancements, increased internet penetration, and evolving consumer preferences. According to a report by Statista, the global online gaming sector is estimated to reach $97 billion in 2024, and is projected to grow to nearly $133 billion by 2029.[1] The cryptocurrency-based iGaming sector is growing even faster, albeit from a smaller base value, with SOFTSWISS estimating growth of over 20% between 2022 and 2023 for crypto-based bets, propelled by the increasing adoption of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which offer more secure, faster, and lower-cost transactions.[2]\n\nRegionally, Europe leads the market, accounting for over 45% of the global iGaming market share in 2022, according to Global Market Insights, thanks to well-established regulatory frameworks in key countries such as the UK, Malta, and Sweden[3]. In North America, research by Statista shows that the U.S. market has seen exponential growth following a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case which struck down the federal ban on sports betting, which has led to an expansion in both online casino and sports betting offerings across multiple states. The U.S. iGaming market is projected to reach $39.8 billion by 2029, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8%, compared to projected revenue of $25 billion in 2024, according to Statista, driven primarily by sports betting and casino games.[4] Canada is also emerging as a lucrative market due to favorable regulatory changes, contributing to North America's strong growth.\n\nLatin America has also become a rapidly expanding market, with countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia at the forefront. The region's iGaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 13% from 2022 to 2028, driven by increased mobile internet usage and the gradual liberalization of gambling laws. [5] Meanwhile, Asia and Africa, although still relatively nascent in the iGaming sector, are expected to hold significant potential. The Asian market, led by countries such as India and Japan, could see a surge in online gaming revenues due to rising smartphone penetration and regulatory shifts. Statista notes that India alone is expected to reach $2.9 billion in online gambling revenue by 2024, growing at a 6% CAGR to just under $4 billion by 2029. [6] Africa, with its expanding mobile infrastructure, is another emerging market, particularly in countries like South Africa and Nigeria.\n\nThe types of games contributing to this growth are diverse. Online casinos-comprising slots, table games, and live dealer games-dominate the iGaming market, contributing to over 37% of total market revenues in 2024 according to Statista. [7] Sports betting is another key growth sector, with mobile sports betting estimated to account for around 70% of the sports betting market in many regions as early as 2020 according to Grand View Research. [8] Management believes that this trend will continue, particularly in South America, Africa and parts of Asia as mobile penetration increases. Grand View Research also estimates that the global sports betting market will grow at a CAGR of 10-12% from 2023 to 2030, reaching $180 billion in revenue by 2030. [9] Additionally, eSports betting is seeing rapid adoption, appealing particularly to younger demographics. According to Market Research Future, the eSports betting market is expected to grow from $9.9 billion in 2022 to over $30 billion by 2032. Management believes that much of this growth will come from the growing popularity of eSports, plus the continued proliferation of mobile devices, especially in Latin America, Asia and Africa.\n\nManagement believes that the future of the iGaming market is filled with opportunities. Cryptocurrency adoption in online casinos offers not only reduced transaction costs but also faster processing times and increased privacy, which we believe are highly appealing to modern gamers. The use of blockchain technology is also expected to bring about greater transparency and trust, with provably fair gaming systems becoming increasingly popular. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are also expected to revolutionize the user experience, making online gambling more immersive. We also expect that the mobile gaming sector will continue to grow as mobile devices become more powerful and widely accessible, especially in emerging markets.\n\nManagement has conducted preliminary research, and identified a number of elements which require ongoing monitoring as the Company works to commercialize its first online casino. First, Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest challenges, as governments in different regions continue to establish or modify laws governing online gambling. Second, cybersecurity threats are also a growing concern, given the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks targeting online casinos and payment systems, which by the very nature of the underlying business, offer prime opportunity for security and personal information breaches. Third, there is heightened scrutiny around social responsibility, with a focus on gambling addiction and the need for responsible gaming measures, which could lead to tighter regulations in various jurisdictions. Management believes the Company's Gaming Technology Platform, which management believes will allow for significant customer interaction, will help the Company address this risk. Competition in the market is fierce, with operators constantly investing in new technologies and marketing to attract and retain customers, further increasing operational costs, all of which will require the Company to continue to invest heavily in both the Gaming Technology Platform and other growth opportunities.\n\n**C._B2C Focus: Blockchain-Enabled Online Casinos_** 180's immediate focus is on __launching B2C online casino operations in high-growth international markets__. The Company's innovative blockchain technology enhances transparency and operational efficiency, providing players with a secure and trustworthy gaming experience, which management believes will be a key differentiator. Key features of this platform include:\n\n  * **Enhanced Transparency:** Blockchain technology ensures secure, immutable transaction records, boosting player trust and confidence in the platform.\n\n  * **Seamless Cryptocurrency Integration:** Players can deposit and withdraw funds using cryptocurrency while maintaining FIAT (traditional currency) wallets and gaming sessions, catering to the growing demand for crypto-friendly platforms.\n\n  * **Superior User Experience:** 180's customer relationship management (CRM) system is designed to enhance player loyalty and increase the lifetime value of customers through personalized engagement and targeted promotions.\n\n\n\n\nManagement is focused on three steps to operationalize the launch of the Company's first online casino. First, the Company is working to source a \"front-end\" customer interface, which is required for operation and commercialization of the Gaming Technology Platform, with plans to evaluate multiple, competitive potential suppliers of customer facing products and to acquire or create a \"front-end\", funding permitting. Second, management is evaluating certain well known and high governance gaming jurisdictions to pursue initial licensing - no final determination has yet been made as to which jurisdiction(s) to pursue. Finally, management is beginning to evaluate a variety of games, which in the iGaming industry are generally sourced from third-party suppliers, to populate the planned front-end customer interface. See below for further details on management's projected commercialization timeline.\n\n_Currency-Agnostic Play and Gaming Variety_ Management believes that a standout feature of the Gaming Technology Platform is its ability to offer currency-agnostic play, enabling customers to easily switch between traditional FIAT currencies and cryptocurrencies during gaming sessions. Management believes this flexibility makes the customer interaction experience better, and therefore makes the Company's ultimate gaming content accessible to a wider audience and supports a more seamless gaming experience for both traditional and crypto-savvy players. In addition, the Gaming Technology Platform is designed to support a wide variety of games, ranging from traditional offerings such as live casino games, including poker and blackjack, to newer rapid-play games such as crash games, as well as potentially in the future, live sports betting, all of which we believe appeal to the evolving preferences of today's global players. We are confident that this blend of game styles will provide a comprehensive gaming experience, catering to the fast-changing tastes of both casual and high-frequency players across different markets.\n\n_High-Growth iGaming Jurisdictions_ 180 expects to launch its planned B2C casino operations in established and high-growth markets where iGaming is gaining traction. Although the Company has not yet determined its first launch jurisdiction, it is currently analyzing the following five, high potential jurisdictions to select one or more launch jurisdictions:\n\n  1. **Germany** : We believe that the recent regulation of online casinos in Germany has opened up significant opportunities in one of Europe's largest gaming markets.\n\n  2. **Brazil** : As one of Latin America's largest and fastest-growing economies, Brazil is a promising market for iGaming, driven by increasing internet access and evolving regulations.\n\n  3. **India** : India's rapidly expanding online user base and growing interest in online casinos make it a high-potential iGaming market.\n\n  4. **Canada** : With provinces such as Ontario regulating iGaming, Canada offers an expanding market for operators to enter the online casino space.\n\n  5. **Colombia** : As one of the first Latin American countries to regulate online gambling, Colombia is a key emerging market with what we believe is a strong potential for growth in the iGaming sector.\n\n\n\n\n_Commercialization Strategy and Timeline_ The commercialization strategy for launching the Company's initial online casino is planned to follow a structured approach to work to ensure a smooth, compliant, and profitable rollout. The first step involves the completion of the technology transfer, where all purchased assets, including software and intellectual property representing the Gaming Technology Platform, are securely transferred to the Company's storage infrastructure. Management currently anticipates that this will be a primary cloud-based server, with a physical server backup. This period is expected to include setting up the necessary server configurations, network security, and data integration which we expect to occur during the next 30 days. During this phase, management of the Company will be fully immersed in the technical aspects of the transfer process to ensure a seamless transition.\n\nConcurrently with the technology transfer phase, management will be working to develop and enhance a comprehensive business strategy to guide 180's new focus on the iGaming sector. This strategy is planned to include selecting suitable web domains for one or more online casinos; creating relevant websites through the use of experienced casino \"front-end\" development teams; defining target customer markets and groups, including evaluation and selection of target customer demographics; and evaluation of content offerings, considering target markets and customer segments. Regulatory and compliance reviews are also an essential part of the comprehensive business strategy, as the iGaming business is highly regulated, with a trend to increasing regulatory scrutiny. This will be particularly important as the Company prepares its initial license application (see below) in one or more jurisdictions. Finally, plans to lay the foundation for customer service solutions, which management believes are a critical component of the customer experience with iGaming.\n\nFollowing the technology transfer phase, and running concurrently with the business strategy development phase, management intends to complete a full technology development review, ensuring that the Gaming Technology Platform fully aligns with business goals and meets the latest industry standards in terms of cybersecurity, information protection and reliability. Any potential gaps, such as development needs or cybersecurity updates, will be identified and addressed within this phase. Following the technology review, front-end development will then begin, which will focus on creating a user-friendly and functional gaming site. This phase may involve evaluating possible third-party solutions or self-developed solutions, giving careful consideration to costs and timing. While evaluating front-end solutions, management also intends to simultaneously evaluate potential gaming solutions. In the iGaming sector, games are generally sourced from third-party suppliers on a revenue share basis. Management will evaluate games based on selected target markets and client groups, as well as carefully considering cost and reliability of any potential game offerings.\n\nEvaluation of licensing regimes will also be a critical component of the overall launch strategy, and management plans to focus on securing a reputable and cost-efficient license will allow the casino to legally operate. Related to licensing, management will also focus on ensuring full compliance with all necessary Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation and requirements, both from an industry perspective but also those unique to the chosen licensing jurisdictions.\n\nThe marketing plan development will be another significant milestone, focusing on identifying and attracting customers through affiliate marketing, direct marketing, and other channels. Critical metrics like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) are expected to be evaluated to ensure profitability for each potential market and customer group. The business strategy will also seek to explore how to build a loyal customer base and position the casino against competitor by using the Company's Technology Gaming Platform, which has a built in customer loyalty functionality.\n\nAs the business begins to scale, assembling a growth team of senior management across marketing, technology, compliance, and other areas will be vital. This team will manage the casino's expansion and oversee the daily operations. During this phase, establishing internal business processes for AML, KYC, accounting, taxation, and responsible gambling tracking will be key to ensuring long-term success and regulatory compliance. Business continuity, disaster recovery, and cybersecurity protocols are also expected to be implemented during this period.\n\nBefore launching, integration and testing will seek to ensure that all components of the casino-front-end, back-end, games, and marketing-work seamlessly together. This testing phase will be necessary to ensure everything is aligned for the official go-live, where the website will launch to the public. During the live testing period following the launch, the team will monitor performance, customer engagement, and feedback, making necessary adjustments to optimize the platform and ensure customer satisfaction.\n\nManagement believes that this structured approach, covering technology, business strategy, licensing, game selection, marketing, and internal processes, will provide a robust roadmap to operationalize the Technology Gaming Platform. Management is targeting having the first online casino fully operational and optimized for growth by the end of Q1 2025, although there can be no guarantee that all elements of the commercialization strategy will be completed on this timeline - lack of funding, slower than anticipated evaluation and contracting, and difficulty sourcing one or more key components could all contribute to delays.\n\n_Legal and Regulatory_ As management evaluates the Company's its first jurisdiction for licensing, it will evaluate multiple options to seek to find the best combination of cost-effectiveness, market acceptability, and high reputation with transparency. The Company currently plans to assess jurisdictions like Curacao, known for its affordable licensing fees and relatively quick approval process, making it attractive for a swift market entry. However, more reputable and highly regulated jurisdictions such as Malta and the Isle of Man will also be considered, as they often offer greater transparency, strong consumer trust, and better access to European markets, though at a higher cost and stricter compliance requirements. Gibraltar could also be an option due to its favorable tax regime and robust regulatory framework.\n\nManagement plans to evaluate each jurisdiction based on licensing costs, annual fees, tax rates, regulatory ease, and the ability to serve key target markets. Transparency and oversight will be critical, as the Company seeks to build credibility in the highly competitive iGaming sector. Ultimately, the jurisdiction chosen will not only be picked to offer the best balance of cost and reputation, but to also align most closely with the Company's target launch markets, ensuring that the license supports our efforts for a successful and compliant entry into those regions.\n\n_Projected Costs_ Management believes that the estimated costs to commercialize an online iGaming casino can vary significantly, depending on the jurisdiction and the scale of the operation, but some key expenses are universal (and somewhat fixed), while others are variable and depend on decisions made by management around business strategy. Costs that management expects to incur, given that the Company has already acquired the Gaming Technology Platform, are expected to include the following: first, sourcing a front-end player interface involves either purchasing or developing a customized platform. Off-the-shelf solutions from iGaming software developers typically start at around $100,000, but can increase dramatically for bespoke or highly tailored platforms. Second, partnerships with game providers require initial setup fees, licensing, and revenue-sharing agreements. These costs may range from $10,000 to over $100,000 per game, depending on the scope of the partnership and the range of games offered. Third, management believes the ensuring a smooth user experience, quality design, and strong cybersecurity are essential, which can also add to the initial outlay, with estimated costs of around $500,000.\n\nBased on research undertaken by management to date, an online casino requires a robust marketing budget, often requiring at least $1-2 million in the first year to build brand recognition through digital advertising, influencer partnerships, affiliate programs, and promotions. Establishing legal and regulatory compliance frameworks adds another layer of cost. In regulated markets, obtaining licenses from gaming authorities can range from $50,000 to over $200,000 per jurisdiction, depending on the region, with ongoing costs for renewal. Legal and regulatory consultants, particularly in complex markets, will require ongoing fees, which could be $20,000 to $100,000 annually. Hiring experienced senior staff like a Chief Compliance Officer, legal experts, and marketing heads will further add to the budget. Salaries for top-tier executives can range from $250,000 to $300,000 annually, making human resources one of the largest ongoing expenses. Regulatory assistance to navigate licensing audits and compliance can add up to another $100,000 annually. Together, these elements make the initial commercialization of an online iGaming casino a significant but potentially lucrative investment.\n\nIn total, management believes that the initial cost to fully commercialize the Gaming Technology Platform, with a license in one key jurisdiction, ten games and an adequate marketing and administrative budget, ranges from $3 million to more than $5 million. We currently have limited cash on hand and expect that we will need to raise this funding through debt or equity funding in the future, which funding may not be available on favorable terms, when required, or at all.\n\n**D._B2B Focus: Blockchain-Enabled Technology Platform_** Management is also evaluating the potential future ability to expand into the global online gaming B2B (business-to-business) market by creating and launching a blockchain-enabled platform aimed at providing gaming operators with a cutting-edge, transparent, and secure solution for running their operations. This move would be a potential strategic extension of 180's newly acquired Gaming Technology Platform, leveraging the benefits of 180's newly acquired blockchain technology to offer innovative tools that enhance operational efficiency, player trust, and business growth for operators worldwide.\n\n_Blockchain Technology: Enhancing Trust and Security_ At the core of 180's potential B2B offering is its advanced blockchain technology, which provides significant advantages for gaming operators. Blockchain's decentralized and immutable nature ensures transparent and secure transaction records, allowing operators to build stronger trust with their players. Every gaming transaction, from deposits and withdrawals to bets and payouts, is recorded on the blockchain, creating an auditable trail that enhances accountability and reduces the risks of fraud or manipulation. Management believes that players are currently demanding increased accountability from gaming operators and have an enhanced focus on potential fraud in the online gaming market globally.\n\nThis increased transparency also simplifies regulatory compliance, as operators can provide clear, verifiable records to regulators in real-time. By offering a platform that integrates blockchain-enabled gaming infrastructure, 180 will help allow operators to position themselves as trustworthy and compliant, which is essential in the highly regulated gaming industry. The regulation of online gaming, cryptocurrencies and online transactions generally is converging across jurisdictions, and management believes that 180's emerging technology has a strong potential to address these key challenges for operators.\n\n_Seamless Cryptocurrency and FIAT Currency Support_ One of the key features of 180's Gaming Technology Platform is its currency-agnostic framework, which supports both cryptocurrency and traditional FIAT currencies. This flexibility provides operators with the ability to cater to a diverse global audience. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to gain popularity, especially among younger and tech-savvy players, 180's platform enables operators to attract this growing demographic by offering seamless crypto-based transactions. According to industry participants, cryptocurrency based wagering accounted for 27.5% of bets placed in the iGaming industry in 2023, with substantial differences in adoption between various markets. [11]\n\nAt the same time, 180's Gaming Technology Platform also supports FIAT currency transactions to cater to traditional players who prefer to use government-issued currencies. This dual currency model is expected to enable operators to broaden their player base while offering an enhanced, user-friendly experience that adapts to the evolving preferences of players globally. We believe that the ability to use both crypto and FIAT wallets within a single platform would give operators a competitive edge in offering flexible financial options to their users.\n\n_Consumer Relationship Management_ The Company's Gaming Technology Platform also includes sophisticated tools such as a built-in customer relationship management (CRM) system, which would enable operators to optimize player engagement and retention. By providing data-driven insights and personalized interactions, operators are expected to be able to increase the lifetime value of their players, fostering long-term growth and loyalty.\n\nWhile management is focused on developing the B2C business as an initial priority, the potential ability to use the Company's Gaming Technology Platform to expand to B2B sources of revenue in the future is of strong interest, and we believe has the potential to provide a valuable source of differentiated revenue for 180 down the road.\n\n**E._Go-Forward Consolidation Strategy_** Finally, management believes that 180 is uniquely positioned to act as a consolidator in the gaming industry, capitalizing on its**Nasdaq listing** , highly experienced**management team and board** , and robust **Gaming Technology Platform**. As a publicly-traded company, 180's Nasdaq listing provides it with access to capital markets and a well recognized stock currency, which we anticipate will allow us to efficiently fund potential future acquisitions. We hope that this liquidity advantage will allow 180 to acquire private gaming companies (both B2C and B2B) at attractive valuations, especially in a market where private firms may lack similar access to capital. Management believes that the global iGaming industry is entering a period of rapid consolidation, and that potentially attractive acquisition opportunities in key jurisdictions could become available in the future. At present, management has identified several potential targets, but is still conducting preliminary diligence and has no immediate acquisition plans.\n\nWe think that **management's experience** across multiple industries, combined with a strategic vision for iGaming, enhances 180's ability to identify and integrate undervalued gaming companies. We plan to work to ensure that future acquisitions are not only executed effectively but also yield **synergistic benefits** that contribute to accretive growth. By incorporating these companies into its **advanced Gaming Technology Platform** , either as technology components or users of the technology, we hope to be able to optimize operational efficiencies, expand our geographic and market reach, and enhance our technological offerings, with our goal of positioning the Company as a leader in the evolving iGaming sector.\n\nAs you can see from the above, we are excited about the opportunity that the iGaming industry presents and our ability to monetize our newly acquired Gaming Technology Platform to build stockholder value.\n\nWe look forward to working hard for our collective benefit and communicating with you regularly moving forward. Thank you again for your invaluable support.\n\nSincerely,\n\n_/s/ Blair Jordan_\n\nInterim CEO, 180 Life Sciences Corp.\n\n**About 180 Life Sciences Corp.** is a publicly-traded company that focuses on developing new technologies across multiple sectors.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNOTE 1 - BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS\n180 Life Sciences Corp., formerly known as KBL Merger Corp. IV (“180LS”, or together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), was a blank check company\norganized under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 7, 2016. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition,\nshare purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.\n180 Life Corp. (“180”, f/k/a 180 Life Sciences Corp. and CannBioRx Life Sciences Corp.) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and was incorporated in the\nState of Delaware on January 28, 2019. The Company is located in the United States (“U.S.”) and is a medical pharmaceutical company focused upon unmet medical needs in\nthe areas of inflammatory diseases, fibrosis, and chronic pain by employing innovative research and, where appropriate, combination therapies, through 180’s three wholly-\nowned subsidiaries, 180 Therapeutics L.P. (“180 LP”), CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“CBR Pharma”), and Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Katexco”). 180 LP, CBR\nPharma and Katexco are together, the “180 Subsidiaries.” Katexco was incorporated on March 7, 2018 and CBR Pharma was incorporated on March 8, 2018, under the\nprovisions of the British Corporation Act of British Columbia. 180 LP was formed as a limited partnership on September 6, 2013, in Delaware. Additionally, 180’s wholly-\nowned subsidiaries Katexco Callco, ULC, Katexco Purchaseco, ULC, CannBioRex Callco, ULC, and CannBioRex Purchaseco, ULC were formed in the Canadian Province of\nBritish Columbia on May 31, 2019 to facilitate the acquisition of Katexco, CBR Pharma and 180 LP. On July 1, 2021, the assets and liabilities of the Canadian companies\n(Katexco and CBR Pharma) were transferred to their respective subsidiaries, which are Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Katexco U.S.”) and CannBioRex Pharma Limited\n(“CBR Pharma U.K.”).\nThe Company is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of therapeutics for unmet medical needs in chronic pain, inflammation, fibrosis,\nand other inflammatory diseases. We have three product development platforms:\n● fibrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”);\n● drugs which are derivatives of cannabidiol (“CBD”) or cannabigerol (“CBG”) analogues (“SCAs”); and\n● alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (“α7nAChR”).\nDue to restrictions in the Company’s resources, the Company has slowed down research and development activities significantly in the SCA platform and the anti-TNF\nplatform. The Company has not made progress on the α7nAChR platform and has suspended further research and development activity in this program.\nThe Company is currently evaluating all options to monetize its existing assets, in addition to exploring other strategic alternatives to maximize value for its\nstockholders. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include, but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger,\nreverse merger, other business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic transactions involving the Company.\nOn September 29, 2024, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Elray Resources, Inc. (“Elray”). Pursuant to the\nPurchase Agreement, Elray agreed to sell us certain source code and intellectual property relating to a “back-end technology platform” which is a key component of creating an\nonline blockchain casino (the “Purchased Assets”) Elray agreed to provide support and assistance to the Company in connection with the building and launching of a fully\noperational casino operation utilizing the Purchased Assets.\n5\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S PLANS\nThe Company has not generated any revenues and has incurred significant losses since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit\nof $129,238,340 and a working capital deficit of $5,158,449, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a net loss of $1,894,683 and cash used in operating activities\nof $529,906. The Company expects to invest a significant amount of capital to commercialize its iGaming assets as well as continuing to fund research and development of the\nCompany’s existing biotechnology assets. On September 29, 2024, the Company acquired certain source code and intellectual property relating to an online blockchain casino\nand plans to build and launch a fully operational casino operation as part of its future operations. The Company expects to invest a significant amount of capital to fund the\ndevelopment and operation of this business, including but not limited to acquisition or development of a “front-end” user interface, sourcing of one or more games, acquiring\nrelevant licenses and investing in marketing. As a result, the Company expects that its operating expenses will increase significantly, and consequently will require significant\nrevenues to become profitable. Even if the Company does become profitable, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company\ncannot predict when, if ever, it will be profitable. There can be no assurance that the intellectual property of the Company, or other technologies it may acquire, will meet\napplicable regulatory standards, obtain required regulatory approvals, will produce products capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs, or be\nsuccessfully marketed.\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of\nliabilities in the normal course of business. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time,\nwhich is defined as within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any\nadjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from uncertainty\nrelated to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as set forth in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included\nin the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial reporting and as required by Regulation S-X, Rule 10-01. Accordingly,\nthey do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including those\nwhich are normal and recurring) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim financial information have been included. When preparing financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP, the Company must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures at\nthe date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Additionally, operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. For further information, refer to the\nfinancial statements and footnotes included in the Company’s annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in the Company’s\nannual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 25, 2024.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company’s\nsignificant estimates and assumptions used in these condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the fair value of financial instruments, warrants,\noptions, derivative liabilities and research and development (R&D) tax credits and accruals. Certain of the Company’s estimates could be affected by external conditions,\nincluding those unique to the Company and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external factors could have an effect on the Company’s estimates\nand may cause actual results to differ from those estimates.\n6\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company’s reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional currency of certain subsidiaries was the British Pound (“GBP”) (1.338 and 1.273 GBP to\n1 US dollar, each as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) for balance sheet accounts, while expense accounts are translated at the weighted average\nexchange rate for the period (1.301 and 1.2655 GBP to 1 US dollar for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.277 and 1. 2442 GBP\nto 1 US dollar each for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively). Equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting translation\nadjustments are recognized in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of an entity from all sources other than investments by owners or distributions to owners and includes\nforeign currency translation adjustments as described above. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded other comprehensive loss of\n$67,332 and other comprehensive income of $51,316, respectively, as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, the Company recorded other comprehensive loss of $81,733 and other comprehensive income of $36,712, respectively, as a result of foreign currency translation\nadjustments.\nForeign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, including intercompany transactions, are included in results of\noperations. The Company recognized ($1,467) and ($350) of foreign currency transaction losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and\nrecognized $2,952 and $1,485 of foreign currency transaction losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Such amounts have been classified\nwithin general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of source code and intellectual property relating to an online blockchain casino acquired on September 29, 2024 and licensed patents held by\nKatexco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as well as technology licenses acquired in connection with the July 2019, corporate restructuring completed between the\nCompany and each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma, pursuant to which each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company\n(the “Reorganization”). The casino technology and intellectual property is amortized over an estimated useful life of three years. Licensed patents are amortized over the\nremaining life of the patent. Technology licenses represent the fair value of licenses acquired for the development and commercialization of certain licenses and knowledge.\nThe technology licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the underlying patents. It will be necessary to monitor and possibly adjust the\nuseful lives of the licensed patents and technology licenses depending on the results of the Company’s research and development activities.\nNet Loss Per Common Share\nBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss\nper common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the number of additional common shares that would\nhave been outstanding if the common share equivalents had been issued (computed using the treasury stock or if converted method), if dilutive.\n7\nIn-Process Research and Development (“IP R&D”)\nIP R&D assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that were acquired on July 16, 2019 in connection with the transaction whereby the Company acquired\neach of Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp., CBR Pharma and 180 LP, which have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. IP R&D assets are\nconsidered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. During the period that the IP R&D assets are\nconsidered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in\ncircumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IP R&D assets are less than their carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon\nregulatory approval, and the Company is able to commercialize products associated with the IP R&D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based\non their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned, the Company may record a full or partial impairment charge related to the IP\nR&D assets, calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the IP R&D assets over their estimated fair value.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet was $12,405,084 (which consisted of carrying amounts of $1,462,084 and\n$10,943,000 related to the Company’s CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). Per the valuation obtained from a third party as of 2022 year-end, the\nfair market value of the Company’s IP R&D assets was determined to be $9,063,000 (which consisted of fair values of $0 and $9,063,000 related to the Company’s CBR\nPharma subsidiary and 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). As of that measurement date, the carrying values of the CBR Pharma and 180 LP subsidiaries’ assets exceeded their\nfair market values by $1,462,084 and $1,880,000, respectively. As such, management determined that the consolidated IP R&D assets were impaired by $3,342,084 and, in\norder to recognize the impairment, the Company recorded a loss for this amount during the fourth quarter of 2022, which appeared as a loss on IP R&D asset impairment on the\nincome statement. This reduced the IP R&D asset balances of its CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary to zero and $9,063,000, respectively, as of December 31,\n2022; and the total consolidated IP R&D asset balance was $9,063,000 after impairment.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet was $9,063,000 (which consisted of a balance related to the Company’s 180\nLP subsidiary); the Company typically assesses asset impairment on an annual basis unless a triggering event or other facts or circumstances indicate that an evaluation should\nbe performed at an earlier date. As of September 30, 2023, the Company assessed the then most recent delays in its commercialization timeline, general economic conditions,\nindustry and market considerations, the Company’s financial performance and all relevant legal, regulatory, and political factors that might indicate the possibility of\nimpairment and concluded that, when these factors were collectively evaluated, it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The Company recorded a loss in the amount\nof $9,063,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, which appears as a loss on impairment to IP R&D assets on the income statement. As a result, as of\nSeptember 30, 2023, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet became $0 (nil).\nAs a result of the write-off of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet and the loss on impairment to IP R&D assets on the income statement, the Company recorded a\ndecrease in its deferred tax liability relating to the impairment of the IP R&D assets of $2.3 million as income tax benefit relating to impairment of the IP R&D assets in the\nsame amount on the income statement for the period ended September 30, 2023.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. Based\nupon that evaluation, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial\nstatements, except as disclosed in Note 13 - Subsequent Events.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the\nCompany’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n8\nNOTE 4 - PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nInsurance $ 571,898 $ 934,990\nResearch and development expense tax credit receivable - 440,161\nProfessional fees 414,217 279,039\nValue-added tax receivable 44,346 9,917\n$ 1,030,461 $ 1,664,107\nNOTE 5 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nOn September 29, 2024, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement with Elray. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Elray agreed to sell us the Purchased\nAssets in consideration for 1,000,000 shares of newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”, and the shares of common stock issuable upon\nconversion thereof, the “Conversion Shares”) and warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Purchase Warrants” and the shares of common\nstock issuable upon exercise thereof, the “Purchase Warrant Shares”).\nOn September 30, 2024, in contemplation of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and pursuant to the power provided to the\nCompany by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of, and filing of, a Certificate of\nDesignations of 180 Life Sciences Corp. Establishing the Designations, Preferences, Limitations and Relative Rights of Its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B\nDesignation”), which was filed with, and became effective with, the Secretary of State of Delaware on the same date. The Series B Designation designated 1,000,000 shares of\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock which were issued to Elray on September 30, 2024 (the “Closing Date”). The Series B Designation designated 1,000,000 shares of Series\nB Convertible Preferred Stock, with a par value of $0.0001 per share and a stated value of $17.30 per share.\nThe purchase of the Purchased Assets closed on September 30, 2024.\nBased on the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock and the Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) 480-10, the instruments are accounted for as a liability due to the variable number of shares issuable under the agreement pursuant to the\nconversion terms. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock liability in aggregate was $2,772,695. The Company estimated the\nfair value of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock based on the market value of the underlying common shares into which the Series B Convertible Preferred stock is\nconvertible into at the transaction date, and an estimated fair value of the liquidation preference using option pricing models for scenarios of the liquidation preference being in\neffect or conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock by the holder.\nThe Purchase Warrants have an exercise price of $1.68 per share, the closing stock price of the Company’s common stock on the last trading day prior to the parties’\nentry into the Purchase Agreement, and a term of seven years (through September 30, 2031). The Purchase Warrants also provide for cashless exercise rights. No shares of\ncommon stock may be issued upon exercise of the Purchase Warrants until or unless the Company has received approval from its stockholders for the issuance of such shares of\ncommon stock upon exercise of the Purchase Warrants. The Company estimated the fair value of the Purchase Warrants of $4,849,346 based on the Black-Scholes option\npricing model with the following key assumptions ranging from: Fair value stock price, $1.68, Exercise price, $1.68, Term 7 years, Volatility 234.08%, Discount rate of 3.60%\nand a dividend yield of 0%.\nThe Company had capitalized intangible cost of $7,622,041 at September 30, 2024, related to the Purchased Assets. The Purchased Assets were not yet placed in\nservice on September 30, 2024, and amortization has not been recorded.\n9\nThe technology acquired from Elray will be amortized over three years based on its nature as acquired technology and its expected useful life.\nThe Company will perform its definite-lived intangible asset impairment test on an annual basis with the initial impairment test after an acquisition completed before\nthe expiration of the next 12 month period.\nIntangible assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following:\nUseful September 30, December 31,\nLife (years) 2024 2023\nSource code and intellectual property 3 $ 7,622,041 $ -\nLicensed Patents 20 530,651 599,686\nTechnology license 20 1,713,448 1,562,744\nIntangible assets 9,866,140 2,162,430\nLess: accumulated amortization (621,665) (542,860)\nIntangible assets, net $ 9,244,475 $ 1,619,570\nAmortization expense was $13,851 and $32,693 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and $61,408 and $83,015 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to intangible assets, which is included in general and administrative expense on the accompanying consolidated statements\nof operations and comprehensive loss.

As of September 30, 2024,\nthe carrying value of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock liability in aggregate was $2,772,695.\nOn September 30, 2024, in contemplation of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and pursuant to the power provided to the\nCompany by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of, and filing of, a Certificate of\nDesignations of 180 Life Sciences Corp. Establishing the Designations, Preferences, Limitations and Relative Rights of Its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B\nDesignation”), which was filed with, and became effective with, the Secretary of State of Delaware on the same date. The Series B Designation designated 1,000,000 shares of\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock which were issued to Elray on the Closing Date.\nThe below is a summary of the rights and preferences of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock:\nVoting Rights. Until such time, if ever, as the shareholders of the Company have approved the issuance of shares of common stock upon the conversion of the Series B\nConvertible Preferred Stock (“Stockholder Approval”), the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock only has rights to vote on amendments to the Series B Designation (which are\nsubject to the approval of a simple majority of the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock), and the Protective Provisions, discussed below.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock requires the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to\n(a) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company; (b) adopt or\nauthorize any new designation of any Preferred Stock or amend the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in a manner which (i) provides any holder of common stock or\npreferred stock any rights upon a liquidation of the Company which are prior and superior to those of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; or (ii) adversely\naffect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (c) effect an exchange, or create a right of exchange, cancel, or create a right to cancel,\nof all or any part of the shares of another class of shares into shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (d) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the\nshares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the shares of such series; and (e) issue any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock, other than the Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the “Protective Provisions”).\nAfter Stockholder Approval, in addition to the above voting rights, each holder of outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast\nthe number of votes in connection with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shares held by such holder equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which\nthe shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter.\nFractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted to common stock basis (after aggregating all fractional shares\ninto which shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. Except as provided by law\nor by the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Series B Designation, holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of\ncommon stock as a single class and there shall be no series voting.\n12\nDividend Rights. None, except that if the Company declares a dividend or makes a distribution of cash (or any other distribution treated as a dividend under Section\n301 of the Internal Revenue Code) on its common stock, each holder of Shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution\nin an amount equal to the largest number of whole shares of common stock into which all shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held of record by such holder are\nconvertible as of the record date for such dividend or distribution or, if there is no specified record date, as of the date of such dividend or distribution. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, holders shall have no right of participation in connection with dividends or distributions made to the common stock stockholders consisting solely of shares of\ncommon stock.\nLiquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary (each a “Liquidation Event”), the\nholders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of the\ncommon stock or securities junior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (other than the common stock) by reason of their ownership of such stock, but after any required\ndistribution to any holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, an amount in cash per share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for each share of Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock held by them equal to the greater of (x) one times the Stated Value; and (y) the total amount of consideration that would have been payable on such share upon\na Liquidation Event, had such share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock been converted into common stock, immediately prior to such Liquidation Event (as applicable, the\n“Liquidation Preference”). The “Stated Value” is $17.30 per share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, for a total aggregate Liquidation Preference of $17,300,000.\nConversion Rights. None prior to Stockholder Approval. After Stockholder Approval, at the option of the holder(s) thereof, each share of Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock is convertible into a number of shares of common stock of the Company as equals the Conversion Rate. The “Conversion Rate” shall initially be 0.685 (or\n685,000 shares in aggregate, which would represent 40% of the Company’s then outstanding shares of common stock), as equitably adjusted, as applicable for stock splits and\nrecapitalizations; provided that if at any time after the original issuance date of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and prior to the Stockholder Approval Date, the\nCompany shall actually issue any additional shares of common stock of the Company (each a “Dilutive Issuance”), the Conversion Rate shall be increased to a value equal to\n(x)(i) the total outstanding shares of common stock (“Total Outstanding Shares”) on the date immediately following such Dilutive Issuance, divided by (ii) 60%, minus (iii) the\nTotal Outstanding Shares on the date immediately following such Dilutive Issuance, divided by (y) 1,000,000, rounded to the thousands place, as equitably adjusted, as\napplicable for stock splits and recapitalizations (each a “Dilutive Adjustment”); provided that in no event will the Conversion Rate be greater than ten. The effect of any change\nin the Conversion Rate shall not be retroactive and shall only apply for conversions of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock following the date of any Dilutive Adjustment. The\nConversion Rate is designed to result in the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock receiving 40% of the then outstanding shares of common stock upon conversion\nof the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to a maximum of 10 million shares of common stock, and further subject to such conversion ratio being fixed upon\nStockholder Approval. The current Conversion Rate of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is 1.318 or 1,318,000 total shares of common stock.\nNOTE 10 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation and Other Loss Contingencies\nThe Company records liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has no liabilities recorded for loss contingencies as of September 30, 2024.\n13\nLegal Matters\nAction Against Former Executive of KBL\nOn September 1, 2021, the Company initiated legal action in the Chancery Court of Delaware against Dr. Marlene Krauss, the Company’s former Chief Executive\nOfficer and director (“Dr. Krauss”) and two of her affiliated companies, KBL IV Sponsor, LLC and KBL Healthcare Management, Inc. (collectively, the “KBL Affiliates”) for,\namong other things, engaging in unauthorized monetary transfers of the Company’s assets, non-disclosure of financial liabilities within the Company’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements, issuing shares of stock without proper authorization; and improperly allowing stockholder redemptions to take place. The Company’s complaint alleges multiple\ncauses of action against Dr. Krauss and/or the KBL Affiliates, and seeks compensatory damages in excess of $11,286,570, together with interest, attorneys’ fees and costs.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its legal action.\nOn October 5, 2021, Dr. Krauss and the KBL Affiliates filed an Answer, Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint against the Company and twelve individuals who\nare, or were, directors and/or officers of the Company, i.e., Marc Feldmann, Lawrence Steinman, James N. Woody, Teresa DeLuca, Frank Knuettel II, Pamela Marrone,\nLawrence Gold, Donald A. McGovern, Jr., Russell T. Ray, Richard W. Barker, Shoshana Shendelman and Ozan Pamir (collectively, the “Third-Party Defendants”). On\nFebruary 24, 2022, Dr. Krauss filed an amended Answer, Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint (the “Amended Counterclaims”), which, among other things, dismissed\nTeresa DeLuca, Frank Knuettel II, Pamela Marrone, Russell T. Ray, Richard W. Barker and Shoshana Shendelman. In essence, the Amended Counterclaims allege that the\nCompany and the remaining Third-Party Defendants made alleged misstatements against Dr. Krauss in SEC filings, failed to register her shares in the Company so that they\ncould be traded, and failed to pay to Dr. Krauss the amounts alleged to be owing under a promissory note in the principal amount of $371,178, plus an additional $300,000\nunder Dr. Krauss’s resignation agreement. On April 19, 2022, Dr. Krauss stipulated to dismiss all of her counterclaims against both Donald A. McGovern, Jr. and Lawrence\nGold.\nOn June 25, 2024, Dr. Krauss filed a Motion for partial summary judgment on her claim that the Company failed to register her shares. The Company has not yet\nresponded to such Motion, and no hearing date has yet been set. Discovery has not yet commenced in the case. The Company and the remaining Third-Party Defendants intend\nto continue to vigorously defend against all the Amended Counterclaims, however, there can be no assurance that they will be successful in the legal defense of such Amended\nCounterclaims.\nAction Against the Company by Dr. Krauss\nOn August 19, 2021, Dr. Krauss initiated legal action in the Chancery Court of Delaware against the Company. The Complaint alleged that the Company is obligated\nto advance expenses including, attorney’s fees, to Dr. Krauss for the costs of defending against an SEC investigation and Subpoenas, and that the Company is also required to\nreimburse Dr. Krauss for the costs of bringing this lawsuit against the Company. On September 3, 2021, Dr. Krauss filed an Amended Complaint which further alleged that Dr.\nKrauss is also allegedly entitled to advancement by the Company of her expenses, including attorney’s fees, for the costs of defending against the Third-Party Complaint in the\nTyche action referenced below, and the costs of defending against the Company’s own Complaint against Dr. Krauss as described above. On or about September 23, 2021, the\nCompany filed its Answer to the Amended Complaint in which the Company denied each of Dr. Krauss’ claims and raised numerous affirmative defenses.\nOn November 15, 2021, Dr. Krauss filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication as to certain of the issues in the case, which was opposed by the Company. On March 7,\n2022, the Court issued a decision denying the Motion in part and granting it in part. The Court then issued an Order implementing such decision on March 29, 2022. The\nparties subsequently engaged in proceedings as set forth in that Order, and the Company was required to pay a portion of those fees while objecting to the remaining portion of\ndisputed fees. On October 10, 2022 and January 18, 2023, Dr. Krauss filed applications to compel the Company to pay the full amount of fees requested by Dr. Krauss for May-\nOctober 2022, and to modify the Court’s Order. On May 3, 2023, the Court issued an Order granting both of Dr. Krauss’s Applications for payment of attorney’s fees totaling\n$714,557, which amount was paid in May 2023.\n14\nNotwithstanding the Order, such ruling does not constitute any final adjudication as to whether Dr. Krauss will ultimately be entitled to permanently retain such\nadvancements, and Dr. Krauss has posted an undertaking with the Court affirmatively promising to repay all such amounts if she is eventually found to be liable for the\nCompany’s and/or the SEC’s claims against her. The Company is seeking payment for a substantial portion of such amounts from its director and officers’ insurance policy\nissued by AmTrust International Underwriters, as referenced below. The Company is currently in discussions with Dr. Krauss regarding a potential settlement of outstanding\nclaims, provided that such settlement may not be entered into on favorable terms, if at all.\nAction Against Tyche Capital LLC\nThe Company commenced and filed an action against defendant Tyche Capital LLC (“Tyche”) in the Supreme Court of New York in the County of New York on April\n15, 2021. In its Complaint, the Company alleged claims against Tyche arising out of Tyche’s breach of its written contractual obligations to the Company as set forth in a\nGuarantee and Commitment Agreement dated July 25, 2019, and a Term Sheet for KBL Business Combination With CannBioRex dated April 10, 2019 (collectively, the\n“Subject Guarantee”), and claimed that Tyche’s breach of the Subject Guarantee caused the Company damages in the amount of at least $6,776,686.\nOn or about May 17, 2021, Tyche responded to the Company’s Complaint by filing an Answer and Counterclaims against the Company alleging that it was the\nCompany, rather than Tyche, that had breached the Subject Guarantee. Tyche also filed a Third-Party Complaint against six third-party defendants, including three members of\nthe Company’s then management, Sir Marc Feldmann, Dr. James Woody, and Ozan Pamir (collectively, the “Individual Company Defendants”), claiming that they allegedly\nbreached fiduciary duties to Tyche with regards to the Subject Guarantee.\nOn November 23, 2021, the Court granted the Company’s request to issue an Order of attachment against all of Tyche’s shares of the Company’s stock that had been\nheld in escrow. In so doing, the Court found that the Company had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the case based on the facts alleged in the Company’s\nComplaint.\nOn February 18, 2022, Tyche filed an Amended Answer, Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint. On August 25, 2022, the Court granted the Company’s Motion to\nDismiss each of the Individual Company Defendants, and also three of the four Counterclaims brought against the Company, leaving only Tyche’s declaratory relief claim. On\nAugust 26, 2022, Tyche filed a Motion to vacate or modify the Company’s existing attachment Order against Tyche’s shares of the Company’s stock held in escrow, however,\nthe Court summarily denied such Motion on January 3, 2023. Although Tyche subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal as to that denial, on May 4, 2023, the Appellate Court\nunanimously affirmed the ruling of the lower Court in the Company’s favor.\nOn January 30, 2023, the Company filed a Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment. In hearings held on September 11 and 19, 2023, the Court granted the\nCompany’s Motion, but referred the question as to the amount of the Company’s damages against Tyche to a special referee. Tyche filed a Notice of Appeal as to the Court’s\nruling.\nOn June 30, 2024, the Company entered into a written Settlement Agreement with Tyche and Ronald Bauer & Samantha Bauer to fully resolve this action with Tyche\nand the Bauer action referenced below. The Settlement Agreement has been fully signed, and the parties are currently engaged in performing its terms, which include, among\nother things, transfer to the Company of Tyche’s shares of the Company’s stock in escrow, transfer to the Company of shares of the Company’s stock held by Theseus Capital\nLtd. and Astatine Capital Ltd., forgiveness of loans to the Company by the Bauer Defendants, exoneration of the Company’s $50,000 bond in the Tyche action, complete mutual\nreleases of all claims and counterclaims in both actions, and dismissal of both the Tyche action and the Bauer action in their entireties. As a result of forgiveness of loans\npayable to the Bauer Defendants totaling $81,720, and accrued interest of $25,171, as well as release of the Company’s $50,000 bond, the Company recognized a gain of\n$156,891 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included in Gain on Settlement of Liabilities on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive\nincome.\n15\nAction Against Ronald Bauer & Samantha Bauer\nThe Company and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. and CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (collectively, the “Company\nPlaintiffs”), initiated legal action against Ronald Bauer and Samantha Bauer, as well as two of their companies, Theseus Capital Ltd. and Astatine Capital Ltd. (collectively, the\n“Bauer Defendants”), in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on February 25, 2022. The Complaint claims that the Bauer Defendants misappropriated funds and stock\nshares, engaged in unauthorized stock sales, and obtained improper travel expenses. The Bauer Defendants filed a Response denying the Civil Claim Complaint of the\nCompany on May 6, 2022.\nOn June 30, 2024, the Company Plaintiffs, Tyche and the Bauer Defendants entered into the Settlement Agreement described above, which fully resolves this action.\nDeclaratory Relief Action Against the Company by AmTrust International\nOn June 29, 2022, AmTrust International Underwriters DAC (“AmTrust”), which was the premerger directors’ and officers’ insurance policy underwriter for KBL,\nfiled a declaratory relief action against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Declaratory Relief Action”) seeking a declaration\nthat AmTrust is not obligated to reimburse the Company for fees advanced by the Company to Dr. Krauss and George Hornig under the directors’ and officers’ insurance policy.\nOn September 20, 2022, the Company filed its Answer and Counterclaims against AmTrust for bad faith breach of AmTrust’s insurance coverage obligations to the\nCompany under the subject insurance policy, seeking at least $2 million in compensatory damages, and punitive damages. In addition, the Company brought a Third-Party\nComplaint against its excess insurance carrier, Freedom Specialty Insurance Company (“Freedom”) seeking declaratory relief that Freedom will also be required to honor its\npolicy coverage as soon as the amount of AmTrust’s insurance coverage obligations to the Company has been exhausted. On October 25, 2022, AmTrust filed its Answer to the\nCompany’s Counterclaims and, on October 27, 2022, Freedom filed its Answer to the Third-Party Complaint.\nOn November 22, 2022, the Company filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication against both AmTrust and Freedom. The Motion was fully briefed and a hearing was\nheld on March 9, 2023. The standard to prevail on a Motion for Summary Adjudication in the Court is high to prevail and requires a judge to find that there are no disputed\nissues of fact so that they can rule on the issues as a matter of law. In this instance the judge found three major issues could be decided as a matter of law in the Company’s\nfavor and that one issue, the Change in Control exclusion, requires further discovery.\nOn April 21, 2023, the Court issued an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\nSpecifically, the Court granted summary adjudication in favor of the Company on the following issues: (a) that the Company is, in fact, an insured under both the\nAmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; (b) that certain SEC subpoena related expenses for defendants Dr. Marlene Krauss, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer\nand Director, and George Hornig, the former Chairman of the Board, are within the basic scope of coverage under both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; and (c)\nthat the Insured vs. Insured exclusion relied upon by AmTrust and Freedom is not applicable to bar any such coverage.\nThe Court also found that there were issues of disputed facts as to the Change in Control exclusion contained within the policies, which therefore precluded the Court\nfrom granting the remainder of the Company’s requests for summary adjudication as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court, at that time, denied the Company’s further\nrequests for summary adjudication and deemed that for the time being, the Change in Control issue is to be determined at the time of trial, in order to find that the policies (i)\nprovide coverage for the fees which the Company has advanced and will advance to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig; (ii) that AmTrust has breached the policy; (iii) that\nAmTrust must pay such expenses of the Company; and that, once the AmTrust policy has been exhausted, (iv) Freedom will be obligated to pay such expenses of the Company\npursuant to its policy.\n16\nOn August 4, 2023, the Court granted the Company’s request to file a second motion for partial summary judgment in the case, this one being on the issue of whether\nAmTrust should be required to advance to the Company the defense costs being incurred by Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig during the pendency of the case. The\nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment was fully briefed by the parties, and a hearing for such Motion was held on January 11, 2024. After the matter was taken under\nsubmission, on February 12, 2024, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against both AmTrust and Freedom, and ordered as follows: (a)\nAmTrust is obligated under its insurance policy with the Company to advance to the Company all defense costs in excess of the deductible that the Company has advanced, or\nwill advance, to Dr. Krauss and Mr. Hornig in connection with certain SEC Subpoenas, and (b) upon exhaustion of the AmTrust insurance policy, Freedom is obligated to do\nthe same pursuant to its excess liability insurance policy with the Company. This Order applies throughout the interim of the case, but does not constitute a final judgment, and\nboth the Company and the two insurers retain their rights to contest all applicable issues at trial, which is scheduled for May 12, 2025. A final judgment following trial could\npotentially confirm these obligations of the insurers or, alternatively, reverse and require the Company to repay all or portions of such advance payments. There is no assurance\nat this time as to what the final judgment may entail.\nOn April 16, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company $2.27 million in reimbursement of fees which the Company has advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig,\nof which the Company received $1.5 million after the payment of attorney’s fees. On May 9, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company $300,140 in reimbursement of fees which the\nCompany had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig, and the Company has received $200,093 after the payment of attorney’s fees.\nThe Company, Freedom and Amtrust held a mediation conference on August 21, 2024, during which, the Company agreed to the terms of a settlement with Freedom,\npursuant to which Freedom agreed to pay $125,000 to the Company, of which the Company received approximately $83,333 after the payment of legal fees.\nOn September 23, 2024, Freedom paid the Company a further $125,000 in reimbursement of fees advanced by the Company, of which the Company received $76,639\nafter the payment of attorney’s fees. On September 5, 2024, the Company and Freedom executed a mutual release agreement. The total of $1,789,443 is included in other\nincome on the Company’s unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nAmtrust and the Company have commenced written discovery proceedings against each other and anticipate that depositions will also occur. The Company intends to\ncontinue to vigorously pursue this matter in order to establish the Company’s entitlement to full and final payment by AmTrust of the subject advancement expenses of the\nCompany. While the Company continues to believe it has a strong case against AmTrust, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this action. The final\noutcome of the litigation is unknown at this time and such final outcome could be materially adverse to the Company.\nOther Commitments\nAmendments to Compensation Agreements\nOn January 10, 2024, and effective on January 1, 2024, the Company entered into (a) a Fourth Amendment to Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Dr.\nJames Woody, the then CEO and Director of the Company; (b) a Fourth Amendment to Employment Agreement with Dr. Jonathan Rothbard, the then Chief Science Officer\n(CSO) of the Company; (c) a Third Amendment to Consulting Agreement with Dr. Lawrence Steinman, the then Executive Chairman of the Company; and (d) a Second\nAmendment to Consulting Agreement with Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann, the former Executive Co-Chairman of the Company (collectively, the “Amendments”), which each\namended the compensation agreements then in place with such individuals.\nPursuant to the Amendments, each of Dr. Woody and Dr. Rothbard, effective as of January 1, 2024, agreed to a reduction of the base salaries set forth in their\nrespective amended employment agreements, by 50%, to $245,000 per year for Dr. Woody and to $100,000 per year for Dr. Rothbard, with the amount of such salary\nreductions ($20,416 per month for Dr. Woody and $8,333 per month for Dr. Rothbard) accruing monthly in arrears, to be paid upon the Company raising at least $5,000,000 in\nfunding subsequent to the date of the Amendments (the “Funding Date”), provided that in the event the Funding Date does not occur prior to March 15, 2025, the amounts\naccrued will be forgiven in their entirety.\n17\nAlso pursuant to the Amendments, each of Dr. Steinman and Sir Marc Feldmann, effective as of January 1, 2024, agreed to a reduction of the base salaries set forth in\ntheir respective consulting agreements, by 100%, to $0 per year for each of Dr. Steinman and Sir Marc Feldmann, with the amount of such salary reductions ($18,750 per\nmonth or $225,000 per year, for Dr. Steinman and £14,167 per month or £170,000 per year, for Sir Marc Feldmann) accruing monthly in arrears, to be paid on the Funding\nDate, provided that in the event the Funding Date does not occur prior to March 15, 2025, the amounts accrued will be forgiven in their entirety.\nWoody Separation Agreement\nOn May 7, 2024, Dr. James N. Woody resigned as Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer), and as a member of the Board of Directors, of the Company\neffective the same date, and entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with the Company (the “Woody Separation Agreement”).\nUnder the Woody Separation Agreement, the Company (a) paid Dr. Woody $50,000 in cash, less all applicable withholdings and required deductions (the “Severance\nCash”); (b) issued Dr. Woody 25,000 fully-vested shares of the Company’s common stock; and (c) provided Dr. Woody the right to earn the Future Contingent Payment (as\ndefined below). The amounts above (except for the amounts payable pursuant to (c), which shall be paid by the 15th day following the date such payment is due as discussed\nbelow), are required to be paid within 15 days of the date of Dr. Woody’s resignation (the “Payment Date”). We also agreed to pay Dr. Woody a bonus of $50,000 (the “Future\nContingent Payment”), [A] if we, within the 24 months following the date of Dr. Woody’s resignation, complete any corporate transaction, including but not limited to any\nmerger, reverse merger, acquisition, disposal, joint-venture and/or investment involving the Company (a “Corporate Transaction”), which results in a Change of Control (a\n“Change of Control” means any Corporate Transaction pursuant to which the ownership of an aggregate of 50.1% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company is held by\none or more parties after completing the Corporate Transaction); or [B] if we raise at least $5 million from any source within 12 months from Dr. Woody’s resignation date. The\nFuture Contingent Payment is to be forfeited from Dr. Woody in the event that we are required to restate any financial statements of the Company for periods prior to Dr.\nWoody’s resignation date, if Dr. Woody was Chief Executive Officer of the Company during such period(s), or any disclosure made by the Company in any report or filing with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, is found by the Company to be materially incorrect or misleading, as determined by the reasonable discretion of the Board of\nDirectors of the Company (each a “Forfeiture Trigger”). In the event a Forfeiture Trigger occurs or is deemed to have occurred, Dr. Woody is also required to promptly repay in\nfull the Severance Cash.\nUnder the Woody Separation Agreement, Dr. Woody agreed to provide a customary general release to the Company, waived any severance pay that would have been\ndue pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, agreed to the termination of his employment agreement, and also agreed to certain confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-\nsolicitation, non-disparagement, and cooperation covenants in favor of the Company. The 25,000 fully-vested shares of the Company’s common stock due to Dr. Woody will be\nissued under the Company’s Second Amended and Restated 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan. As a result of the separation, the Company had a total of $237,748 of accrued\nexpenses owed to Dr. Woody waived in full, realizing a gain of $132,498 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which is included in additional paid-in capital on\nthe consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity (deficit) due to the related party nature of the settlement.\nFeldmann Separation Agreement\nEffective on September 5, 2024, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, CBR Pharma and the Company, entered into a Separation and Release Agreement with Sir\nMarc Feldmann, the former Co-Executive Chairman of the Company, the former Chief Executive Officer of CBR Pharma, and the former director of CBR Pharma, which was\namended to clarify such agreement was effective September 5, 2024 (as amended, the “Feldmann Separation Agreement”).\nUnder the Feldmann Separation Agreement, the Company agreed to issue Sir Marc Feldmann 57,328 shares of common stock and options to purchase 20,000 shares of\ncommon stock with a term of two years and an exercise price of $1.95 per share, the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on September 5, 2024, under the\nCompany’s Second Amended and Restated 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan to satisfy amounts owed to Sir Marc Feldmann in consideration for services previously rendered to\nCBR Pharma.

The shares were issued on September 10, 2024, and had a fair value of $101,471.\nThe fair value of the options at issuance was $28,591. The Company valued the options using the Black-Scholes model with the following key assumptions ranging from: Fair\nvalue stock price, $1.95, Exercise price, $1.95, Term 2 years, Volatility 153.71%, Discount rate of 3.75% and a Dividend yield of 0%. The Company recognized no gain or loss\non the Feldmann Separation Agreement.\n18\nAlso effective on September 5, 2024, the Company entered into an Indemnification Agreement with Sir Marc Feldmann to provide for indemnification to Sir Marc\nFeldmann under Delaware law.

Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, Dr. Steinman waived and forgave all amounts accrued and owed to him\nunder the Consulting Agreement through such date, and agreed that compensation payable to him under the Consulting Agreement moving forward would be $0, provided that\nas long as Dr. Steinman remains a member of the Board of Company, he is to receive the same compensation payable to other non-executive members of the Board of\nDirectors. As a result of the Fourth Amendment, the Company had $175,313 in accrued expenses owed to Dr. Steinman waived in full, and realized a gain on the transaction of\n$175,313, which is included in additional paid-in capital on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity (deficit) due to the related party nature of the settlement.\nDr. Steinman also agreed to step down as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and to instead serve as a regular member of the Board of Directors, provided\nthat on May 7, 2024, Dr. Steinman was appointed as a member of the then Strategy and Alternatives Committee of the Company.\n19\nAppointment of Interim Chief Executive Officer and Consulting Agreement\nAlso effective on May 7, 2024, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Blair Jordan, a then member of the Board of Directors of the Company, as Interim Chief\nExecutive Officer and Principal Executive Officer of the Company, to fill the vacancy left by Dr. Woody’s resignation. Upon such appointment, Mr. Jordan ceased being the\nLead Independent director of the Company (which position is currently vacant), and ceased being a member of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nOn May 7, 2024, the Company entered into an Executive Consulting Agreement with Mr. Jordan and Blair Jordan Strategy and Finance Consulting Inc. (an entity\nowned by Mr. Jordan) (“Jordan Consulting” and the “Jordan Consulting Agreement”). Pursuant to the Jordan Consulting Agreement, the Company agreed to engage Jordan\nConsulting to provide the services of Mr. Jordan to the Company as Interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

The\nReverse Stock Split was effective on February 28, 2024 and the shares of the Company’s common stock began trading on NASDAQ on a post-split basis on February 28, 2024,\nwith new CUSIP number: 68236V302. No change was made to the trading symbol for the Company’s shares of common stock or public warrants, “ATNF” and “ATNFW”,\nrespectively, in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.\nIn addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options and other equity awards (including shares reserved for issuance under the\nCompany’s equity compensation plans), and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants were proportionately adjusted, using the 1-for-19 ratio.\nIn addition, the exercise price for each outstanding stock option and warrant was increased in inverse proportion to the 1-for-19 split ratio such that upon an exercise, the\naggregate exercise price payable by the optionee or warrant holder to the Company for the shares subject to the option or warrant will remain approximately the same as the\naggregate exercise price prior to the Reverse Stock Split, subject to the terms of such securities.\nFurther, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Class K Special Voting Shares (the “Voting Stock”), following the Effective Time, the Voting Stock was convertible\ninto a number of shares of common stock equal to, and votes a number of voting shares equal to, 14 shares; provided that such Class K Special Voting Shares were\nsubsequently converted into 14 shares of common stock on March 14, 2024. As a result of such conversion, there are no longer any Class K Special Voting Shares outstanding.\nThe Company’s Class C Special Voting Shares had converted into common stock in previous reporting periods and there are no longer any Class C Special Voting Shares\noutstanding.\nThe rights and privileges of the holders of shares of common stock are substantially unaffected by the Reverse Stock Split.\nShares issued to former Board Members\nOn April 23, 2024, the Company issued 63,818 shares of common stock to former board members, in lieu of cash, to compensate for a total of $112,024 in accrued\nboard of director fees. The Company recognized a loss on the issuance of $9,230, included in additional paid-in capital on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity\n(deficit). The shares were issued under the Company’s Second Amended and Restated 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan.\nShares issued for Services\nOn July 19, 2024, the Company issued a total of 28,012 shares of common stock to two consultants in settlement of approximately $96,000 of accounts payable in\nconsideration for services rendered.

The shares had a fair value of\n$59,50 and the Company recognized a gain of $36,682 during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nNasdaq Listing Rule Non-Compliance\nWe have previously been out of compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements due to our failure to maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share\nfor our common stock, which failure was remedied in March 2024.\n21\nAlso, on October 11, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the shareholder approval\nrequirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), which require prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving the issuance of 20% or\nmore of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the applicable Minimum Price (as defined in Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)), which non-compliance we remedied in\nDecember 2023.\nAdditionally, on November 15, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum\nstockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Equity Rule”) requires companies listed on the\nNasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000. In the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany reported a stockholders’ deficit of ($149,327), which is below the minimum stockholders’ equity required for continued listing pursuant to the Equity Rule.\nAdditionally, the Company does not meet the alternative Nasdaq continued listing standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules and did not meet the minimum stockholders’ equity\nrequirement as of December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 or June 30, 2024.\nNasdaq provided the Company until January 2, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance. We submitted the plan to regain compliance in a timely manner,\nand on January 11, 2024, Nasdaq advised the Company that it has determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with the Equity Rule.\nThe terms of the extension were as follows: on or before May 13, 2024, the Company must have completed certain transactions described in greater detail in the\ncompliance plan, contemplated to result in the Company increasing its stockholders’ equity to more than $2.5 million, and opt for one of the two following alternatives to\nevidence compliance with the Equity Rule: Alternative 1: The Company must have furnished to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available report (e.g., a Form 8-K) including: 1.\nA disclosure of the Staff’s deficiency letter and the specific deficiency(ies) cited; 2. A description of the completed transaction or event that enabled the Company to satisfy the\nstockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing; and 3. An affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, the Company believed it had regained compliance with\nthe stockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transaction or event referenced in Step 2; or Alternative 2: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a\npublicly available report including: 1. Steps 1 & 2 set forth above; 2. A balance sheet no older than 60 days with pro forma adjustments for any significant transactions or event\noccurring on or before the report date; and 3. That the Company believes it satisfies the stockholders’ equity requirement as of the report date. The pro forma balance sheet must\nhave evidenced compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement.\nAdditionally, in either case the Company was required to disclose that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company’s ongoing compliance with the stockholders’\nequity requirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting.\nSeparately, on May 14, 2024, the Staff provided us notice of our non-compliance with the audit committee requirements for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital\nMarket set forth in Listing Rule 5605(c)(2), which requires that listed companies maintain an audit committee of at least three independent directors. Nasdaq provided the\nCompany a cure period in order to regain compliance as follows: until the earlier of the Company’s next annual shareholders’ meeting or May 7, 2025; or if the next annual\nshareholders’ meeting is held before November 4, 2024, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than November 4, 2024. In the event the Company does not\nregain compliance by the applicable date above, Nasdaq rules require the Staff to provide written notification to the Company that its securities will be delisted. At that time, the\nCompany may appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. The Company is currently seeking out qualified independent directors to serve on the Company’s audit\ncommittee and plans to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5605(c)(2) in the near future.\nWhile the Company was able to undertake some of the transactions described in the Equity Rule compliance plan, it was unable to regain compliance with the Equity\nRule prior to the end of the plan period (May 13, 2024). As a result, on May 14, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter from the Listing Qualifications\ndepartment of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “Staff”) advising the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension.\nSpecifically, the Company did not complete its proposed transactions and was unable to file a Current Report Form 8-K by the May 13, 2024 deadline previously required by\nthe Staff, evidencing compliance with the Equity Rule. On May 17, 2024, the Company requested an appeal of the Staff’s delisting determination, and on May 20, 2024, the\nStaff advised the Company that the delisting action referenced in the Staff’s determination letter had been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel\n(“Panel”). On July 2, 2024, the Company received notice that the Panel had determined to grant the Company’s request to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market,\nsubject to the Company meeting certain conditions, including filing on or before July 31, 2024, a public disclosure describing the transactions undertaken by the Company to\nachieve compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing rules and demonstrate long-term compliance with the Equity Rule and providing an indication of its equity following those\ntransactions. On July 22, 2024, the Panel granted the Company’s request for additional time to achieve compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing rules and demonstrate long-\nterm compliance with the Equity Rule. Specifically, the Hearings Panel subsequently extended that deadline to September 30, 2024, and subsequently extended such deadline\nfurther to October 15, 2024, to regain compliance with the Equity Rule and to allow the continued listing of the Company’s common stock and warrants on The Nasdaq Stock\nMarket through such date, subject to the Company’s compliance with the Equity Rule on or prior to such date.\n22\nAs a result of the acquisition of the Purchased Assets, issuance of the 1,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Purchase Warrants, on October 4,\n2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq confirming that we had regained compliance with the Equity Rule. Nasdaq also advised the Company that in application of Listing Rule\n5815(d)(4)(B), the Company will be subject to a mandatory panel monitor for a period of one year from the date of such letter. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the\nStaff finds that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Equity Rule, then, notwithstanding Rule 5810(c)(2), the Company will not be permitted to provide the Staff\nwith a plan of compliance with respect to such deficiency and the Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for the Company to regain compliance with respect to such\ndeficiency, nor will the Company be afforded an applicable cure or compliance period pursuant to Rule 5810(c)(3). Instead, the Staff will issue a Delist Determination Letter\nand the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable. The Company\nwill have the opportunity to respond/present to the Hearings Panel as provided by Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(C) and the Company’s securities may at that time be delisted from\nNasdaq.\nIf the Company’s common stock and public warrants are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company’s common stock and public warrants or to\nobtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company’s common stock and public warrants could suffer a material decline. Delisting could also impair the Company’s ability\nto raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under outstanding agreements or securities of the Company.\nNotwithstanding the above, the Company remains out of compliance with the audit committee requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq set forth in Listing Rule\n5605(c)(2), which requires that listed companies maintain an audit committee of at least three independent directors, as discussed above. The Company is currently seeking\nqualified independent Board members and hopes to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5602(c)(2) in the near future.\nAmendment to August 2023 Offering\nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor (the “Purchaser”), in addition to certain purchasers who\nrelied on the Company’s registration statement filed with the SEC on July 25, 2023, which became effective on August 9, 2023, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell\nan aggregate of 35,102 shares of common stock (the “August 2023 Shares”), pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 207,814 shares of common stock (“August\n2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”), and common stock warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 242,915 shares of common stock (the “August 2023 Common Warrants”), at a\ncombined purchase price of $12.35 per share and warrant (the “August 2023 Offering”). Aggregate gross proceeds from the August 2023 Offering were $2,999,606. Net\nproceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $2.7 million.\nThe placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately $300,000 were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The August 2023 Offering closed on\nAugust 14, 2023.\nOn November 28, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the August 2023 Offering (“Amendment to the August 2023 Offering”), whereby (i) the Purchaser\nagreed to pay an additional $830,769 in connection with the repricing of the August 2023 Shares and August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants (the “Repricing Amount”), and (ii) the\nCompany agreed to issue to the Purchaser additional pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 257,205 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $0.0019 per share (the\n“Additional Pre- Funded Warrants”), and warrants to purchase up to 477,058 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $3.23 per share (the “Additional Common\nWarrants”, collectively the “Additional Warrants”).\n23\nOther than exercise price and exercisability, the Additional Warrants have the same terms and conditions as the August 2023 Pre-funded Warrants and the August 2023\nCommon Warrants and, as such, were determined to be equity-classified because they met the limited exception in the case of a change-in-control. In accordance with the\nAmendment to the August 2023 Offering, the Company entered into a warrant amendment agreement to amend the following outstanding warrants held by the Purchaser: (i)\nwarrants to purchase up to 16,138 shares of common stock issued in July 2022; (ii) warrants to purchase up to 135,339 shares of common stock issued in December 2022; (iii)\nwarrants to purchase up to 82,668 shares of common stock issued in April 2023; and (iv) warrants to purchase up to 242,915 shares of common stock issued in August 2023\n(collectively, the “Prior Common Warrants”), to have an exercise price equal to $3.23 per share and an expiration date of February 16, 2029.\nDuring February and March 2024, all of the additional 257,205 pre-funded warrants issued in connection with the Amendment to the August 2023 Offering were\nexercised for a value of $489.\nSecond Amendment to the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nOn February 16, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders as of December 18, 2023, and approved the adoption of a Second Amendment to the\n180 Life Sciences Corp. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Such amendment increased the maximum number of shares available to be issued under the Plan from 24,736 shares to\n223,679 shares.\nStock Options\nA summary of the option activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is presented below:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining\nNumber of Exercise Term Intrinsic\nOptions Price (Years) Value\nOutstanding, January 1, 2024 17,788 $ 633.95 9.0 -\nGranted 20,000 1.95 2.0 -\nForfeited (14,897) - - -\nOutstanding, September 30, 2024 22,891 $ 61.92 2.7 $ -\nExercisable, September 30, 2024 22,354 $ 49.47 2.6 $ -\nA summary of outstanding and exercisable stock options as of September 30, 2024 is presented below:\nStock Options Outstanding Stock Options Exercisable\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Number of Remaining Number of\nPrice Shares Life in Years Shares\n$ 1,683.40 473 6.4 467\n$ 1,501.00 130 7.3 109\n$ 516.80 710 7.6 183\n$ 12.73 1,578 8.9 1,574\n$ 1.95 20,000 1.9 20,000\n22,891 2.6 22,333\n24\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $16,456 and $274,826 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, related\nto the amortization of stock options; expense of $15,156 and $269,627 is included within general and administrative expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations for the three and nine month period and expense of $1,300 and $5,200 is included within research and development expenses on the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations for the three month period.

Pursuant to the Inducement Agreement, the Holder agreed to exercise for cash\nExisting Warrants to purchase up to 950,069 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.48 per share. On October 16 and 17, 2024, the Existing Warrants were exercised\nin full for cash by the Holder and the Company received $3,320,331 before deducting financial advisory fees and other expenses payable by us.\nOn October 17, 2024, the Company issued the Holder new warrants to purchase up to 1,900,138 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share (the\n“New Warrants” and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof, the “New Warrant Shares”) pursuant to the terms of the Inducement Agreement. The New\nWarrants are immediately exercisable and have a term of exercise of five years.\nThe Company agreed in the Inducement Agreement to file a registration statement on Form S-1 to register the resale of the New Warrant Shares upon exercise of the\nNew Warrants (the “Resale Registration Statement”) by November 15, 2024, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to have such Resale Registration Statement declared\neffective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) within sixty (60) calendar days following the date of filing with the Commission (or ninety (90)\ncalendar days following the date of filing with the Commission in the event of a ‘full review’ by the Commission) and to keep the Resale Registration Statement effective at all\ntimes until no holder of the New Warrants owns any New Warrants or New Warrant Shares.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Factors that could cause or\ncontribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report, and in other reports we file with the SEC, and in our most recent Annual Report on\nForm 10-K. All references to years relate to the calendar year ended December 31st of the particular year.\nThis information should be read in conjunction with the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q, and the audited financial statements and notes thereto and “Part II.

The information on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report and should not be considered a\npart of this Report.\nGoing Concern and Management Liquidity Plans\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $129,238,340 and a working capital deficit of $5,158,449, and for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, a net loss of $1,894,683 and cash used in operating activities of $529,906. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming\nthe Company will continue as a going concern. As we are not generating revenues, we need to raise a significant amount of capital in order to pay our debts and cover our\noperating costs. While the Company raised money in August 2021, July 2022, December 2022 and April 2023, August 2023 and November 2023 (see Note 2 – Going Concern\nand Management’s Plans); on April 16, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company $2.27 million in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and\nGeorge Hornig for indemnification as former officers and directors, of which the Company received $1.5 million after the payment of attorney’s fees; on May 9, 2024, AmTrust\npaid the Company an additional $300,140 in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig, of which the Company\nreceived $200,093 after the payment of attorneys’ fees; pursuant to the terms of a settlement with Freedom on September 23, 2024. Freedom agreed to pay $125,000 to the\nCompany, of which the Company received approximately.\n30\nWe are subject to all the substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the absence of a\nlong-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating losses until we can successfully implement our business\nstrategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. We may never achieve profitable operations or generate significant revenues.\nWe currently have a minimum monthly cash requirement of approximately $200,000, which is required to support the Company’s operations. We believe that in the\naggregate, we will require significant additional capital funding to complete the commercialization of our back-end blockchain casino assets, including but not limited to\nacquisition or development of a “front-end” user interface, sourcing of one or more games, acquiring relevant licenses and investing in marketing, support and expand the\nresearch and development and marketing of our products, fund future clinical trials, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and\ndevelopment costs, payment obligations, office space and systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from products\nare fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs, if ever.\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations with the proceeds from equity and debt financings. We have experienced liquidity issues due to, among other\nreasons, our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the issuance of equity and promissory notes that are convertible into\nshares of our common stock to fund our operations and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that exposure. We anticipate that we will need to issue equity to fund our\noperations and repay our outstanding debt for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to achieve operational profitability or we are not successful in securing other forms of\nfinancing, we will have to evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the\nCompany be unable to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report also include a going concern footnote.\nAdditionally, wherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-\ncash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has\nauthority, without action or vote of the shareholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which\nwould result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock,\nsubject to certain exceptions), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock.\nIn addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the\nownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing\nmanagement’s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nOrganization of MD&A\nOur Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the “MD&A”) is provided in addition to the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. MD&A is organized as follows:\n● Business Overview and Recent Events. A summary of the Company’s business and certain material recent events.\n31\n● Significant Financial Statement Components. A summary of the Company’s significant financial statement components.\n● Results of Operations. An analysis of our financial results comparing the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n● Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows and discussion of our financial condition.\n● Critical Accounting Estimates. Accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported\nfinancial results and forecasts.\nBusiness Overview\nBiotechnology Product Development\nThis MD&A and the related financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily cover the operations of 180, which is a\nclinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California, focused on the development of therapeutics for unmet medical needs in chronic pain,\ninflammation, fibrosis and other inflammatory diseases. We have three product development platforms:\n● fibrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”);\n● drugs which are derivatives of cannabidiol (“CBD”) or cannabigerol (“CBG”) analogues (“SCAs”); and\n● alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (“α7nAChR”).\nDue to restrictions in the Company’s resources, the Company has slowed down research and development activities significantly in the SCA platform and the anti-TNF\nplatform, and the Company has not made progress in the α7nAChR platform and has suspended further research and development activity in this program in the meantime.\nThe Company is currently evaluating all options to monetize its existing assets, in addition to exploring other strategic alternatives to maximize value for its\nstockholders. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include, but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger,\nreverse merger, other business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic transactions involving the Company.\nPlanned iGaming Casino Operations\nAsset Purchase Agreement\nOn September 29, 2024, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Elray Resources, Inc. (“Elray”). Pursuant to the Purchase\nAgreement, Elray agreed to sell us certain source code and intellectual property relating to an online blockchain casino (the “Purchased Assets”) in consideration for 1,000,000\nshares of newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”, and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion thereof, the “Conversion\nShares”) and warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Purchase Warrants” and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise\nthereof, the “Purchase Warrant Shares”).\nThe Purchase Agreement includes (i) customary covenants of each of the parties and confidentiality requirements; and (ii) customary indemnification requirements of\nthe parties, subject to a $25,000 deductible.\nThe closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement were subject to certain customary conditions to closing, including the filing of the designation\nof the Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Delaware, and the receipt by the Company of an opinion of Hempstead & Co., LLC to the effect that, as of the date of such\nopinion and subject to the assumptions, qualifications, limitations and such other factors deemed relevant by Hempstead & Co., LLC, as set forth in such opinion, the purchase\nprice to be paid by the Company was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company, which opinion was received verbally on September 29, 2024, which conditions to\nclosing were either satisfied or waived by the parties on September 30, 2024.\n32\nThe acquisition contemplated by the Purchase Agreement closed on September 30, 2024 (the “Closing” and such date, the “Closing Date”).\nFollowing the Closing, Elray agreed to provide support and assistance to the Company in connection with the building and launching of a fully operational casino\noperation utilizing the Purchased Assets, at no cost to the Company for a period of six months following the Closing, provided that such assistance shall not exceed 40 hours\nper week without the prior written approval of the Seller (the “Post-Closing Assistance”). The Post-Closing Assistance will also require Elray to assist the Company with\nobtaining payment gateways and licensing where required, acknowledging that the Company will require a front end (the “Front-End Development”). Following the Closing, at\nthe request of the Company, Elray and the Company shall negotiate in good faith to come to agreement on an arrangement whereby Elray will, for an additional cost agreed to\nby Elray, help the Company complete the Front-End Development, or at the request of the Company, Elray shall introduce the Company to a vendor that would sell such a front\nend for one or more casinos that will operate on the Purchased Assets at a cost to be agreed between such vendor and the Company, in the Company’s sole discretion. The\nCompany has sole discretion to determine which, if any, vendor it retains for the Front End Development.\nThe Purchase Agreement also restricts Elray, in perpetuity, from copying, selling, assigning, hypothecating, or otherwise transferring the Purchased Assets to any other\nparty, without the prior written consent of the Company, and provides for the Company to be the sole owner of the Purchased Assets, except that Elray shall be authorized to\nretain and use the Purchased Assets for its own benefit and utilize such assets to provide SAAS solutions and hosted casino solutions to third party companies.\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to file a proxy statement with the SEC (the “Proxy Statement”) to seek stockholder approval for the issuance of the\nConversion Shares and Purchase Warrant Shares, under applicable rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, as soon as reasonably practicable. We also agreed to use our reasonable\nbest efforts to: (i) cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to our stockholders as promptly as practicable following sign off from the Commission on such Proxy Statement, or\nno later than the 20th day after such preliminary Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, in the event the SEC does not notify the Company of its intent to review such Proxy\nStatement, and (ii) ensure that the Proxy Statement complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and Exchange Act. We are also required\nto hold a shareholders meeting to seek shareholder approval for the issuance of the Conversion Shares and Warrant Shares promptly after the SEC has confirmed that it has no\ncomments on such Proxy Statement (the “Stockholder Approval”, and the date of such Stockholder Approval, the “Stockholder Approval Date”).\nCommon Stock Purchase Warrants\nIn connection with the Closing, on September 30, 2024, we granted warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock to Elray pursuant to a Common Stock\nPurchase Warrant (the “Warrant Agreement”). The Purchase Warrants have an exercise price of $1.68 per share, the closing stock price of the Company’s common stock on the\nlast trading day prior to the parties’ entry into the Purchase Agreement, and a term of seven years (through September 30, 2031). The Purchase Warrants also provide for\ncashless exercise rights. No shares of common stock may be issued upon exercise of the Purchase Warrants until or unless the Company has received Stockholder Approval.\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock\nOn September 30, 2024, in contemplation of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, and pursuant to the power provided to the\nCompany by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of, and filing of, a Certificate of\nDesignations of 180 Life Sciences Corp. Establishing the Designations, Preferences, Limitations and Relative Rights of Its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B\nDesignation”), which was filed with, and became effective with, the Secretary of State of Delaware on the same date. The Series B Designation designated 1,000,000 shares of\nSeries B Convertible Preferred Stock which were issued to Elray on the Closing Date.\n33\nThe below is a summary of the rights and preferences of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock:\nVoting Rights. Until such time, if ever, as Stockholder Approval is received, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock only has rights to vote on amendments to the\nSeries B Designation (which are subject to the approval of a simple majority of the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock), and the Protective Provisions, discussed\nbelow.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock requires the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to\n(a) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company; (b) adopt or\nauthorize any new designation of any Preferred Stock or amend the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in a manner which (i) provides any holder of common stock or\npreferred stock any rights upon a liquidation of the Company which are prior and superior to those of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; or (ii) adversely\naffect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (c) effect an exchange, or create a right of exchange, cancel, or create a right to cancel,\nof all or any part of the shares of another class of shares into shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (d) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the\nshares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the shares of such series; and (e) issue any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock, other than the Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the “Protective Provisions”).\nAfter Stockholder Approval, in addition to the above voting rights, each holder of outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast\nthe number of votes in connection with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shares held by such holder equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which\nthe shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter.\nFractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted to common stock basis (after aggregating all fractional shares\ninto which shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share. Except as provided by law\nor by the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Series B Designation, holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of\ncommon stock as a single class and there shall be no series voting.\nDividend Rights. None, except that if the Company declares a dividend or makes a distribution of cash (or any other distribution treated as a dividend under Section\n301 of the Internal Revenue Code) on its common stock, each holder of Shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution\nin an amount equal to the largest number of whole shares of common stock into which all shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held of record by such holder are\nconvertible as of the record date for such dividend or distribution or, if there is no specified record date, as of the date of such dividend or distribution. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, holders shall have no right of participation in connection with dividends or distributions made to the common stock stockholders consisting solely of shares of\ncommon stock.\nLiquidation Preference. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, either voluntary or involuntary (each a “Liquidation Event”), the\nholders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive prior and in preference to any distribution of any of the assets of the Company to the holders of the\ncommon stock or securities junior to the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (other than the common stock) by reason of their ownership of such stock, but after any required\ndistribution to any holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, an amount in cash per share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for each share of Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock held by them equal to the greater of (x) one times the Stated Value; and (y) the total amount of consideration that would have been payable on such share upon\na Liquidation Event, had such share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock been converted into common stock, immediately prior to such Liquidation Event (as applicable, the\n“Liquidation Preference”). The “Stated Value” is $17.30 per share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, for a total aggregate Liquidation Preference of $17,300,000.\n34\nConversion Rights. None prior to Stockholder Approval. After Stockholder Approval, at the option of the holder(s) thereof, each share of Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock is convertible into a number of shares of common stock of the Company as equals the Conversion Rate. The “Conversion Rate” shall initially be 0.685 (or\n685,000 shares in aggregate, which would represent 40% of the Company’s then outstanding shares of common stock), as equitably adjusted, as applicable for stock splits and\nrecapitalizations; provided that if at any time after the original issuance date of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and prior to the Stockholder Approval Date, the\nCompany shall actually issue any additional shares of common stock of the Company (each a “Dilutive Issuance”), the Conversion Rate shall be increased to a value equal to\n(x)(i) the total outstanding shares of common stock (“Total Outstanding Shares”) on the date immediately following such Dilutive Issuance, divided by (ii) 60%, minus (iii) the\nTotal Outstanding Shares on the date immediately following such Dilutive Issuance, divided by (y) 1,000,000, rounded to the thousands place, as equitably adjusted, as\napplicable for stock splits and recapitalizations (each a “Dilutive Adjustment”); provided that in no event will the Conversion Rate be greater than ten. The effect of any change\nin the Conversion Rate shall not be retroactive and shall only apply for conversions of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock following the date of any Dilutive Adjustment. The\nConversion Rate is designed to result in the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock receiving 40% of the then outstanding shares of common stock upon conversion\nof the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to a maximum of 10 million shares of common stock, and further subject to such conversion ratio being fixed upon\nStockholder Approval. The current Conversion Rate of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is 1.318 or 1,318,000 total shares of common stock.\nRedemption Rights. None.\nPlan of Operations Regarding iGaming Assets\nWe are planning to strategically enter into the online gaming industry, utilizing the Purchased Assets, i.e., our newly acquired “back-end” gaming platform, which\nincorporates blockchain technology and full cryptocurrency operability (the “Gaming Technology Platform”). The Company plans to use this technology platform to establish a\nblockchain-based business aimed at the global iGaming market. Initially focusing on B2C (business-to-consumer) online casinos, the Company also plans to expand into a B2B\n(business-to-business) model, offering a seamless blockchain-enabled technology platform for gaming operators worldwide. In addition, management has identified certain\nglobal iGaming industry characteristics and trends that they believe make potential acquisition opportunities attractive. Management believes that the combination of the\nGaming Technology Platform and the strength of a Nasdaq listing make the Company an attractive consolidation vehicle for the iGaming industry, and plan to work to identify\npotential acquisitions (although no targets exist at present).\nA. The Gaming Technology Platform\nThe Gaming Technology Platform includes advanced components designed to support online casinos using blockchain technology. These components are as follows:\n1. Blockchain Casino Operations Back-End: A robust infrastructure designed to support casino game programming through secure and scalable server/cloud\nsolutions, database management, and blockchain payment processing.\n2. Blockchain to FIAT Seamless Exchange Technology: A proprietary system allowing players to deposit and withdraw using cryptocurrency, while maintaining\nFIAT-based wallets and gaming sessions. We believe that this cutting-edge technology offers a significant competitive advantage in the growing blockchain casino\nmarket.\n3. Blockchain API Technology: A sophisticated application program interface (API) that facilitates reliable FIAT-to-blockchain and blockchain-to-FIAT payment\ngateways, supporting credit cards, e-wallets, and multiple cryptocurrencies while enabling blockchain-exclusive online casino operations.\n4. Player Account Management: A secure system for managing player accounts, including registration, login, and player profiles, alongside know-your-client\n(KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance features.\n35\n5. Loyalty Systems for Blockchain Users: A customer relationship management system designed to foster player loyalty and enhance the lifetime value of each\ncustomer by catering to blockchain users.\n6. Affiliate Tracking System: A tool to monitor traffic, registrations, and referral sources, allowing for scalable growth through affiliate partnerships and the\ndistribution of referral fees and royalties.\nAt the heart of the acquisition of the Gaming Technology Platform is proprietary source code, as well as specialized implementation know-how, much of which will be\ntransferred from Elray to the Company, as detailed below. Management intends to further develop both the proprietary source code, enhancing and expanding the commercial\npotential of the Gaming Technology Platform, as well as continue to build expertise in the operation of the Gaming Technology Platform. Management believes that the\nexisting Gaming Technology Platform, plus future potential enhancements, provide a strong competitive barrier, and position the Company well as the iGaming industry moves\ntowards both greater cryptocurrency acceptance, and the safety of blockchain enabled platforms.\nB. Industry Background\nThe global iGaming casino market has rapidly ascended as a major player in the digital entertainment industry, experiencing remarkable growth fueled by\ntechnological advancements, increased internet penetration, and evolving consumer preferences. According to a report by Statista, the global online gaming sector is estimated\nto reach $97 billion in 2024, and is projected to grow to nearly $133 billion by 2029. The cryptocurrency-based iGaming sector is growing even faster, albeit from a smaller\nbase value, with SOFTSWISS estimating growth of over 20% between 2022 and 2023 for crypto-based bets, propelled by the increasing adoption of digital currencies like\nBitcoin and Ethereum, which offer more secure, faster, and lower-cost transactions.\nRegionally, Europe leads the market, accounting for over 45% of the global iGaming market share in 2022, according to Global Market Insights, thanks to well-\nestablished regulatory frameworks in key countries such as the UK, Malta, and Sweden. In North America, research by Statista shows that the U.S. market has seen exponential\ngrowth following a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court case which struck down the federal ban on sports betting, which has led to an expansion in both online casino and sports betting\nofferings across multiple states. The U.S. iGaming market is projected to reach $39.8 billion by 2029, growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8%,\ncompared to projected revenue of $25 billion in 2024, according to Statista, driven primarily by sports betting and casino games. Canada is also emerging as a lucrative market\ndue to favorable regulatory changes, contributing to North America’s strong growth.\nLatin America has also become a rapidly expanding market, with countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia at the forefront. The region’s iGaming market is\nexpected to grow at a CAGR of over 13% from 2022 to 2028, driven by increased mobile internet usage and the gradual liberalization of gambling laws. Meanwhile, Asia and\nAfrica, although still relatively nascent in the iGaming sector, are expected to hold significant potential. The Asian market, led by countries such as India and Japan, could see a\nsurge in online gaming revenues due to rising smartphone penetration and regulatory shifts. Statista notes that India alone is expected to reach $2.9 billion in online gambling\nrevenue by 2024, growing at a 6% CAGR to just under $4 billion by 2029. Africa, with its expanding mobile infrastructure, is another emerging market, particularly in\ncountries like South Africa and Nigeria.\nThe types of games contributing to this growth are diverse. Online casinos—comprising slots, table games, and live dealer games—dominate the iGaming market,\ncontributing to over 37% of total market revenues in 2024 according to Statista. Sports betting is another key growth sector, with mobile sports betting estimated to account for\naround 70% of the sports betting market in many regions as early as 2020 according to Grand View Research. Management believes that this trend will continue, particularly in\nSouth America, Africa and parts of Asia as mobile penetration increases. Grand View Research also estimates that the global sports betting market will grow at a CAGR of 10-\n12% from 2023 to 2030, reaching $180 billion in revenue by 2030. Additionally, eSports betting is seeing rapid adoption, appealing particularly to younger demographics.\nAccording to Market Research Future, the eSports betting market is expected to grow from $9.9 billion in 2022 to over $30 billion by 2032. Management believes that much of\nthis growth will come from the growing popularity of eSports, plus the continued proliferation of mobile devices, especially in Latin America, Asia and Africa.\n36\nManagement believes that the future of the iGaming market is filled with opportunities. Cryptocurrency adoption in online casinos offers not only reduced transaction\ncosts but also faster processing times and increased privacy, which we believe are highly appealing to modern gamers. The use of blockchain technology is also expected to\nbring about greater transparency and trust, with provably fair gaming systems becoming increasingly popular. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are also expected\nto revolutionize the user experience, making online gambling more immersive. We also expect that the mobile gaming sector will continue to grow as mobile devices become\nmore powerful and widely accessible, especially in emerging markets.\nManagement has conducted preliminary research, and identified a number of elements which require ongoing monitoring as the Company works to commercialize its\nfirst online casino. First, Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest challenges, as governments in different regions continue to establish or modify laws governing\nonline gambling. Second, cybersecurity threats are also a growing concern, given the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks targeting online casinos and payment systems,\nwhich by the very nature of the underlying business, offer prime opportunity for security and personal information breaches. Third, there is heightened scrutiny around social\nresponsibility, with a focus on gambling addiction and the need for responsible gaming measures, which could lead to tighter regulations in various jurisdictions. Management\nbelieves the Company’s Gaming Technology Platform, which management believes will allow for significant customer interaction, will help the Company address this risk.\nCompetition in the market is fierce, with operators constantly investing in new technologies and marketing to attract and retain customers, further increasing operational costs,\nall of which will require the Company to continue to invest heavily in both the Gaming Technology Platform and other growth opportunities.\nC. B2C Focus: Blockchain-Enabled Online Casinos\nOur immediate focus is on launching B2C online casino operations in high-growth international markets. The Company’s innovative blockchain technology enhances\ntransparency and operational efficiency, providing players with a secure and trustworthy gaming experience, which management believes will be a key differentiator. Key\nfeatures of this platform include:\n● Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain technology ensures secure, immutable transaction records, boosting player trust and confidence in the platform.\n● Seamless Cryptocurrency Integration: Players can deposit and withdraw funds using cryptocurrency while maintaining FIAT (traditional currency) wallets and\ngaming sessions, catering to the growing demand for crypto-friendly platforms.\n● Superior User Experience: 180’s customer relationship management (CRM) system is designed to enhance player loyalty and increase the lifetime value of\ncustomers through personalized engagement and targeted promotions.\nManagement is focused on three steps to operationalize the launch of the Company’s first online casino. First, the Company is working to source a “front-end”\ncustomer interface, which is required for operation and commercialization of the Gaming Technology Platform, with plans to evaluate multiple, competitive potential suppliers\nof customer facing products and to acquire or create a “front-end”, funding permitting. Second, management is evaluating certain well known and high governance gaming\njurisdictions to pursue initial licensing – no final determination has yet been made as to which jurisdiction(s) to pursue. Finally, management is beginning to evaluate a variety\nof games, which in the iGaming industry are generally sourced from third-party suppliers, to populate the planned front-end customer interface. See below for further details on\nmanagement’s projected commercialization timeline.\n37\nCurrency-Agnostic Play and Gaming Variety\nManagement believes that a standout feature of the Gaming Technology Platform is its ability to offer currency-agnostic play, enabling customers to easily switch\nbetween traditional FIAT currencies and cryptocurrencies during gaming sessions. Management believes this flexibility makes the customer interaction experience better, and\ntherefore makes the Company’s ultimate gaming content accessible to a wider audience and supports a more seamless gaming experience for both traditional and crypto-savvy\nplayers. In addition, the Gaming Technology Platform is designed to support a wide variety of games, ranging from traditional offerings such as live casino games, including\npoker and blackjack, to newer rapid-play games such as crash games, as well as potentially in the future, live sports betting, all of which we believe appeal to the evolving\npreferences of today’s global players. We are confident that this blend of game styles will provide a comprehensive gaming experience, catering to the fast-changing tastes of\nboth casual and high-frequency players across different markets.\nHigh-Growth iGaming Jurisdictions\nWe expect to launch our planned B2C casino operations in established and high-growth markets where iGaming is gaining traction. Although the Company has not yet\ndetermined its first launch jurisdiction, it is currently analyzing the following five, high potential jurisdictions to select one or more launch jurisdictions:\n1. Germany: We believe that the recent regulation of online casinos in Germany has opened up significant opportunities in one of Europe’s largest gaming markets.\n2. Brazil: As one of Latin America’s largest and fastest-growing economies, Brazil is a promising market for iGaming, driven by increasing internet access and\nevolving regulations.\n3. India: India’s rapidly expanding online user base and growing interest in online casinos make it a high-potential iGaming market.\n4. Canada: With provinces such as Ontario regulating iGaming, Canada offers an expanding market for operators to enter the online casino space.\n5. Colombia: As one of the first Latin American countries to regulate online gambling, Colombia is a key emerging market with what we believe is a strong\npotential for growth in the iGaming sector.\nCommercialization Strategy and Timeline\nThe commercialization strategy for launching the Company’s initial online casino is planned to follow a structured approach to work to ensure a smooth, compliant,\nand profitable rollout. The first step involves the completion of the technology transfer, where all purchased assets, including software and intellectual property representing the\nGaming Technology Platform, are securely transferred to the Company’s storage infrastructure. Management currently anticipates that this will be a primary cloud-based server,\nwith a physical server backup. This period is expected to include setting up the necessary server configurations, network security, and data integration which we expect to occur\nduring the next 90 to 120 days. During this phase, management of the Company will be fully immersed in the technical aspects of the transfer process to ensure a seamless\ntransition.\nConcurrently with the technology transfer phase, management will be working to develop and enhance a comprehensive business strategy to guide the Company’s new\nfocus on the iGaming sector. This strategy is planned to include selecting suitable web domains for one or more online casinos; creating relevant websites through the use of\nexperienced casino “front-end” development teams; defining target customer markets and groups, including evaluation and selection of target customer demographics; and\nevaluation of content offerings, considering target markets and customer segments. Regulatory and compliance reviews are also an essential part of the comprehensive business\nstrategy, as the iGaming business is highly regulated, with a trend to increasing regulatory scrutiny. This will be particularly important as the Company prepares its initial\nlicense application (see below) in one or more jurisdictions. Finally, the Company plans to lay the foundation for customer service solutions, which management believes are a\ncritical component of the customer experience with iGaming.\n38\nFollowing the technology transfer phase, and running concurrently with the business strategy development phase, management intends to complete a full technology\ndevelopment review, ensuring that the Gaming Technology Platform fully aligns with business goals and meets the latest industry standards in terms of cybersecurity,\ninformation protection and reliability. Any potential gaps, such as development needs or cybersecurity updates, will be identified and addressed within this phase. Following the\ntechnology review, front-end development will then begin, which will focus on creating a user-friendly and functional gaming site. This phase may involve evaluating possible\nthird-party solutions or self-developed solutions, giving careful consideration to costs and timing. While evaluating front-end solutions, management also intends to\nsimultaneously evaluate potential gaming solutions. In the iGaming sector, games are generally sourced from third-party suppliers on a revenue share basis. Management will\nevaluate games based on selected target markets and client groups, as well as carefully considering cost and reliability of any potential game offerings.\nEvaluation of licensing regimes will also be a critical component of the overall launch strategy, and management plans to focus on securing a reputable and cost-\nefficient license which will allow the casino to legally operate. Related to licensing, management will also focus on ensuring full compliance with all necessary Anti-Money\nLaundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation and requirements, both from an industry perspective but also those unique to the chosen licensing jurisdictions.\nThe marketing plan development will be another significant milestone, focusing on identifying and attracting customers through affiliate marketing, direct marketing,\nand other channels. Critical metrics like Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) are expected to be evaluated to ensure profitability for each\npotential market and customer group. The business strategy will also seek to explore how to build a loyal customer base and position the casino against competitor by using the\nCompany’s Technology Gaming Platform, which has a built in customer loyalty functionality.\nAs the business begins to scale, assembling a growth team of senior management across marketing, technology, compliance, and other areas will be vital. This team\nwill attempt to manage the casino’s expansion and oversee the daily operations. During this phase, establishing internal business processes for anti-money laundering, know\nyour customer, accounting, taxation, and responsible gambling tracking will be key to ensuring long-term success and regulatory compliance. Business continuity, disaster\nrecovery, and cybersecurity protocols are also expected to be implemented during this period.\nBefore launching, integration and testing will seek to ensure that all components of the casino—front-end, back-end, games, and marketing—work seamlessly\ntogether. This testing phase will be necessary to ensure everything is aligned for the official go-live, where the website will launch to the public. During the live testing period\nfollowing the launch, the team will monitor performance, customer engagement, and feedback, making necessary adjustments to optimize the platform and ensure customer\nsatisfaction.\nManagement believes that this structured approach, covering technology, business strategy, licensing, game selection, marketing, and internal processes, will provide a\nrobust roadmap to operationalize the Technology Gaming Platform. Management is targeting having the first online casino fully operational and optimized for growth by the\nend of Q1 2025, although there can be no guarantee that all elements of the commercialization strategy will be completed on this timeline – lack of funding, slower than\nanticipated evaluation and contracting, and difficulty sourcing one or more key components could all contribute to delays.\nLegal and Regulatory\nAs management evaluates the Company’s first jurisdiction for licensing, it will evaluate multiple options to seek to find the best combination of cost-effectiveness,\nmarket acceptability, and high reputation with transparency. The Company currently plans to assess jurisdictions like Curacao, known for its affordable licensing fees and\nrelatively quick approval process, making it attractive for a swift market entry. However, more reputable and highly regulated jurisdictions such as Malta and the Isle of Man\nwill also be considered, as they often offer greater transparency, strong consumer trust, and better access to European markets, though at a higher cost and stricter compliance\nrequirements. Gibraltar could also be an option due to its favorable tax regime and robust regulatory framework.\n39\nManagement plans to evaluate each jurisdiction based on licensing costs, annual fees, tax rates, regulatory ease, and the ability to serve key target markets.\nTransparency and oversight will be critical, as the Company seeks to build credibility in the highly competitive iGaming sector. Ultimately, the jurisdiction chosen will not only\nbe picked to offer the best balance of cost and reputation, but to also align most closely with the Company’s target launch markets, ensuring that the license supports our efforts\nfor a successful and compliant entry into those regions.\nProjected Costs\nManagement believes that the estimated costs to commercialize an online iGaming casino can vary significantly, depending on the jurisdiction and the scale of the\noperation, but some key expenses are universal (and somewhat fixed), while others are variable and depend on decisions made by management around business strategy. Costs\nthat management expects to incur, given that the Company has already acquired the Gaming Technology Platform, are expected to include the following: first, sourcing a front-\nend player interface involves either purchasing or developing a customized platform. Off-the-shelf solutions from iGaming software developers typically start at around\n$100,000, but can increase dramatically for bespoke or highly tailored platforms. Second, partnerships with game providers require initial setup fees, licensing, and revenue-\nsharing agreements. These costs may range from $10,000 to over $100,000 per game, depending on the scope of the partnership and the range of games offered. Third,\nmanagement believes that ensuring a smooth user experience, quality design, and strong cybersecurity are essential, which can also add to the initial outlay, with estimated\ncosts of around $500,000.\nBased on research undertaken by management to date, an online casino requires a robust marketing budget, often requiring at least $1-2 million in the first year to\nbuild brand recognition through digital advertising, influencer partnerships, affiliate programs, and promotions. Establishing legal and regulatory compliance frameworks adds\nanother layer of cost. In regulated markets, obtaining licenses from gaming authorities can range from $50,000 to over $200,000 per jurisdiction, depending on the region, with\nongoing costs for renewal. Legal and regulatory consultants, particularly in complex markets, will require ongoing fees, which could be $20,000 to $100,000 annually. Hiring\nexperienced senior staff like a Chief Compliance Officer, legal experts, and marketing heads will further add to the budget. Salaries for top-tier executives can range from\n$250,000 to $300,000 annually, making human resources one of the largest ongoing expenses. Regulatory assistance to navigate licensing audits and compliance can add up to\nanother $100,000 annually. Together, these elements make the initial commercialization of an online iGaming casino a significant but potentially lucrative investment.\nIn total, management believes that the initial cost to fully commercialize the Gaming Technology Platform, with a license in one key jurisdiction, ten games and an\nadequate marketing and administrative budget, ranges from $3 million to more than $5 million. We currently have limited cash on hand and expect that we will need to raise\nthis funding through debt or equity funding in the future, which funding may not be available on favorable terms, when required, or at all.\nD. B2B Focus: Blockchain-Enabled Technology Platform\nManagement is also evaluating the potential future ability to expand into the global online gaming B2B (business-to-business) market by creating and launching a\nblockchain-enabled platform aimed at providing gaming operators with a cutting-edge, transparent, and secure solution for running their operations. This move would be a\npotential strategic extension of our newly acquired Gaming Technology Platform, leveraging the benefits of our newly acquired blockchain technology to offer innovative tools\nthat enhance operational efficiency, player trust, and business growth for operators worldwide.\nBlockchain Technology: Enhancing Trust and Security\nAt the core of our potential B2B offering is our advanced blockchain technology, which provides significant advantages for gaming operators. Blockchain’s\ndecentralized and immutable nature ensures transparent and secure transaction records, allowing operators to build stronger trust with their players. Every gaming transaction,\nfrom deposits and withdrawals to bets and payouts, is recorded on the blockchain, creating an auditable trail that enhances accountability and reduces the risks of fraud or\nmanipulation. Management believes that players are currently demanding increased accountability from gaming operators and have an enhanced focus on potential fraud in the\nonline gaming market globally.\n40\nThis increased transparency also simplifies regulatory compliance, as operators can provide clear, verifiable records to regulators in real-time. By offering a platform\nthat integrates blockchain-enabled gaming infrastructure, we expect to help allow operators to position themselves as trustworthy and compliant, which is essential in the highly\nregulated gaming industry. The regulation of online gaming, cryptocurrencies and online transactions generally is converging across jurisdictions, and management believes\nthat our emerging technology has a strong potential to address these key challenges for operators.\nSeamless Cryptocurrency and FIAT Currency Support\nOne of the key features of our Gaming Technology Platform is our currency-agnostic framework, which supports both cryptocurrency and traditional FIAT currencies.\nThis flexibility provides operators with the ability to cater to a diverse global audience. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to gain popularity, especially\namong younger and tech-savvy players, our platform enables operators to attract this growing demographic by offering seamless crypto-based transactions. According to\nSOFTSWISS, cryptocurrency based wagering accounted for 27.5% of bets placed in the iGaming industry in 2023, with substantial differences in adoption between various\nmarkets.\nAt the same time, our Gaming Technology Platform also supports FIAT currency transactions to cater to traditional players who prefer to use government-issued\ncurrencies. This dual currency model is expected to enable operators to broaden their player base while offering an enhanced, user-friendly experience that adapts to the\nevolving preferences of players globally. We believe that the ability to use both crypto and FIAT wallets within a single platform would give operators a competitive edge in\noffering flexible financial options to their users.\nConsumer Relationship Management\nThe Company’s Gaming Technology Platform also includes sophisticated tools such as a built-in customer relationship management (CRM) system, which would\nenable operators to optimize player engagement and retention. By providing data-driven insights and personalized interactions, operators are expected to be able to increase the\nlifetime value of their players, fostering long-term growth and loyalty.\nWhile management is focused on developing the B2C business as an initial priority, the potential ability to use the Company’s Gaming Technology Platform to expand\nto B2B sources of revenue in the future is of strong interest, and we believe has the potential to provide a valuable source of differentiated revenue for 180 down the road.\nE. Go-Forward Consolidation Strategy\nFinally, management believes that we are uniquely positioned to act as a consolidator in the gaming industry, capitalizing on our Nasdaq listing, highly experienced\nmanagement team and Board, and robust Gaming Technology Platform. As a publicly-traded company, our Nasdaq listing provides us with access to capital markets and a well-\nrecognized stock currency, which we anticipate will allow us to efficiently fund potential future acquisitions. We hope that this liquidity advantage will allow us to acquire\nprivate gaming companies (both B2C and B2B) at attractive valuations, especially in a market where private firms may lack similar access to capital. Management believes that\nthe global iGaming industry is entering a period of rapid consolidation, and that potentially attractive acquisition opportunities in key jurisdictions could become available in\nthe future. At present, management has identified several potential targets, but is still conducting preliminary diligence and has no immediate acquisition plans.\nWe think that management’s experience across multiple industries, combined with a strategic vision for iGaming, enhances our ability to identify and integrate\nundervalued gaming companies. We plan to work to ensure that future acquisitions are not only executed effectively but also yield synergistic benefits that contribute to\naccretive growth. By incorporating these companies into our advanced Gaming Technology Platform, either as technology components or users of the technology, we hope to\nbe able to optimize operational efficiencies, expand our geographic and market reach, and enhance our technological offerings, with our goal of positioning the Company as a\nleader in the evolving iGaming sector.\n41\nSignificant Financial Statement Components\nResearch and Development\nTo date, 180’s research and development expenses have related primarily to discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical development of its three product platforms:\nfibrosis and anti-TNF; drugs which are derivatives of CBD, and α7nAChR. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with those three product\nplatforms, which include:\n● expenses incurred under agreements with 180’s collaboration partners and third-party contract organizations, investigative clinical trial sites that conduct research\nand development activities on its behalf, and consultants;\n● costs related to production of clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;\n● laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical and clinical trials;\n● employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; and\n● facilities and other expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation and amortization expense and other supplies.\nWe expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We accrue for costs incurred as services are provided by monitoring the\nstatus of each project and the invoices received from our external service providers. We adjust our accrual as actual costs become known. When contingent milestone payments\nare owed to third parties under research and development arrangements or license agreements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are\nachieved.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development\ncosts than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that research and development\nexpenses will increase over the next several years as clinical programs progress and as we seek to initiate clinical trials of additional product candidates. It is also expected that\nincreased research and development expenses will be incurred as additional product candidates are selectively identified and developed. However, it is difficult to determine\nwith certainty the duration and completion costs of current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of product candidates.\nThe duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n● per patient trial costs;\n● the number of patients that participate in the trials;\n● the number of sites included in the trials;\n● the countries in which the trials are conducted;\n● the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;\n● the number of doses that patients receive;\n42\n● the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n● potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n● the impact of COVID-19 and other health pandemics on our trials;\n● the duration of patient follow-up; and\n● the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates.\nIn addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability and commercial\nviability. We will determine which programs to pursue and fund in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each\nproduct candidate’s commercial potential.\nBecause the product candidates are still in clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts\nnecessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Due to the early-stage\nnature of these programs, we do not track costs on a project-by-project basis. As these programs become more advanced, we intend to track the external and internal cost of\neach program.\nCommercialization of Technology Gaming Platform\nManagement believes that the estimated costs to commercialize an online iGaming casino can vary significantly, depending on the jurisdiction and the scale of the\noperation, but some key expenses are universal (and somewhat fixed), while others are variable and depend on decisions made by management around business strategy. Costs\nthat management expects to incur, given that the Company has already acquired the Gaming Technology Platform, are expected to include the following: first, sourcing a front-\nend player interface involves either purchasing or developing a customized platform. Off-the-shelf solutions from iGaming software developers typically start at around\n$100,000, but can increase dramatically for bespoke or highly tailored platforms. Second, partnerships with game providers require initial setup fees, licensing, and revenue-\nsharing agreements. These costs may range from $10,000 to over $100,000 per game, depending on the scope of the partnership and the range of games offered. Third,\nmanagement believes that ensuring a smooth user experience, quality design, and strong cybersecurity are essential, which can also add to the initial outlay, with estimated\ncosts of around $500,000.\nBased on research undertaken by management to date, an online casino requires a robust marketing budget, often requiring at least $1-2 million in the first year to\nbuild brand recognition through digital advertising, influencer partnerships, affiliate programs, and promotions. Establishing legal and regulatory compliance frameworks adds\nanother layer of cost. In regulated markets, obtaining licenses from gaming authorities can range from $50,000 to over $200,000 per jurisdiction, depending on the region, with\nongoing costs for renewal. Legal and regulatory consultants, particularly in complex markets, will require ongoing fees, which could be $20,000 to $100,000 annually. Hiring\nexperienced senior staff like a Chief Compliance Officer, legal experts, and marketing heads will further add to the budget. Salaries for top-tier executives can range from\n$250,000 to $300,000 annually, making human resources one of the largest ongoing expenses. Regulatory assistance to navigate licensing audits and compliance can add up to\nanother $100,000 annually. Together, these elements make the initial commercialization of an online iGaming casino a significant but potentially lucrative investment.\nIn total, management believes that the initial cost to fully commercialize the Gaming Technology Platform, with a license in one key jurisdiction, ten games and an\nadequate marketing and administrative budget, ranges from $3 million to more than $5 million.\n43\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other staff-related costs, including stock-based compensation for shares of common stock issued\nand options granted to founders, directors and personnel in executive, commercial, finance, accounting, legal, investor relations, facilities, business development and human\nresources functions and include vesting conditions.\nOther significant general and administrative costs include costs relating to facilities and overhead costs, legal fees relating to corporate and patent matters, litigation,\nSEC filings, insurance, investor relations costs, fees for accounting and consulting services, and other general and administrative costs. General and administrative costs are\nexpensed as incurred, and we accrue amounts for services provided by third parties related to the above expenses by monitoring the status of services provided and receiving\nestimates from our service providers and adjusting our accruals as actual costs become known.\nIt is expected that the general and administrative expenses will increase over the next several years to support our both our continued research and development\nactivities as they relate to our existing biotechnology assets, and also the commercialization of our Technology Gaming Platform, including but not limited to front-end\nplatforms, technology development and protection, marketing expenses and licensing. These increases are anticipated to include increased costs related to the hiring of\nadditional personnel, developing commercial infrastructure, fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, as well as expenses related to services associated with\nmaintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements, insurance and investor relations costs.\nOther Income\nOther income primarily represents fees earned for research and development work performed for other companies, some of which are related parties.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense related to debt instruments.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities represents the non-cash change in fair value of derivative liabilities during the reporting period. Losses resulting from\nchanges in fair value of derivative liabilities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were driven by increases in stock price during the periods, resulting in\na higher fair value of the underlying liability.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development expense $ 251,577 $ 972,113\nResearch and development - related parties 151,138 132,880\nGeneral and administrative 576,378 2,433,194\nTotal Operating Expenses 979,093 3,538,187\nLoss From Operations (979,093) (3,538,187)\nOther (Expense) Income:\nOther income 118,723 -\nInterest expense (13,633) (11,634)\nLoss on IP R&D asset impairment - (9,063,000)\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities - 2,036\nGain on settlement of liabilities 37,283 -\nTotal other income, net 142,373 (9,072,598)\nLoss Before Income Taxes (836,720) (12,610,785)\nIncome tax benefit - 2,345,025\nNet Loss $ (836,720) $ (10,265,760)\n44\nResearch and Development\nWe incurred research and development expenses of $251,577 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $972,113 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, representing a decrease in research and development expenses of $720,536 or 74%. The decrease in research and development expense includes a) an\noverall decrease in research and development (R&D) program spending based on Company resource allocation and b) a reduction in stock-based compensation of\napproximately $80,000.\nResearch and Development – Related Parties\nWe incurred research and development expenses – related parties of $151,138 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $132,880 for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of $18,258, or 14%. The increase is attributable to a UK R&D tax credit that was received in 2023 (which reduced\nthe 2023 expenses) that was not earned in 2024.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe incurred general and administrative expenses of $576,378 and $2,433,194 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a\ndecrease of $1,856,816 or 76% for the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period. The decrease resulted from reduced professional fees of approximately $636,000 from lower\nconsulting and accounting fees, reduced insurance expense of $338,000, reduced salaries expense of approximately $264,000 from reduced headcount in connection with lower\noverall operations in the current period and a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $548,000. The decline in stock compensation is primarily due to\nprevious awards being fully vested in 2023 and no significant new grants within the past year.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nWe incurred other income, net of $142,373 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net of $9,072,598 for the three months\nended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in other income, net of $9,214,971 or 102%. The increase is primarily attributable to an impairment to IP R&D assets in the\nprior year of approximately $9.1 million (see Note 3 – IP R&D, under “Part I – Item 1. Financial Statements” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNet Income (Loss)\nWe had net loss of $836,720 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss $10,265,760 for the three months ended September 30, 2023,\nrepresenting a decrease in net loss of $9,429,040 or 92%, for the reasons discussed above, primarily the insurance proceeds received.\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development expense $ 1,105,086 $ 2,339,863\nResearch and development - related parties 455,345 481,027\nGeneral and administrative 3,357,868 9,204,122\nTotal Operating Expenses 4,918,299 12,025,012\nLoss From Operations (4,918,299) (12,025,012)\nOther (Expense) Income:\nOther income 2,870,789 -\nInterest expense (41,442) (34,796)\nLoss on IP R&D asset impairment - (9,063,000)\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities 58 69,776\nGain on settlement of liabilities 194,211 -\nTotal other income, net 3,023,616 (9,028,020)\nLoss Before Income Taxes (1,894,683) (21,053,032)\nIncome tax benefit - 2,345,025\nNet Loss $ (1,894,683) $ (18,708,007)\n45\nResearch and Development\nWe incurred research and development expenses of $1,105,086 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to research and development expenses of\n$2,339,863 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease in expenses of $1,234,777 or 53%. The decrease in research and development expenses\nincludes a reduction in stock-based compensation of approximately $242,000 and an overall decrease in R&D program spending based on Company resource allocation.\nResearch and Development – Related Parties\nWe incurred research and development expenses – related parties of $455,345 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $481,027 for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, representing a decrease of $25,682, or 5%, which was mainly the result of an overall decrease in R&D program spending based on\nCompany resource allocation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe incurred general and administrative expenses of $3,357,868 and $9,204,122 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing a\ndecrease of $5,846,254 or 64% for the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period. The decrease resulted from reduced legal fees of approximately $1.1 million from lower\nactivity related to ongoing litigation in the current period, reduced professional fees of approximately $2.0 million from lower consulting and accounting fees, reduced salaries\nexpense of approximately $857,000 from a reduction in headcount and a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.2 million. The decline in stock-\nbased compensation is primarily due to previous awards being fully vested in 2023 and no significant new grants within the past year.\nOther Income Expense, Net\nWe incurred other income, net of $3,023,616 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to other expense, net of $9,028,020 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, representing an increase in other income, net of $12,051,636 or 133%. The increase is primarily attributable to an impairment to IP R&D assets in\nthe prior year of approximately $9.1 million (see Note 3 – IP R&D, under “Part I – Item 1. Financial Statements” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements), $1,712,804 in proceeds received from AmTrust, a gain on settlement of liabilities with a lender of $156,928, and a gain of $1,039,364 from settlements with\ncertain R&D contractors (see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies—Legal Matters, to the notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements included above under Part\nI Financial Information—Item 1. Financial Statements).\nNet Loss\nWe had a net loss of $1,894,963 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18,708,007 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing\na decrease in net loss of $16,813,324 or 90%, for the reasons discussed above.\n46\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash balances of $194,920 and $1,975,799, respectively, and working capital deficits of $5,158,449 and\n$1,422,710, respectively, largely due to a decrease in cash related to cash used in operations.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash used in operating activities was $529,906 and $8,762,209, respectively. Our cash used in operations for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $1,894,683, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $329,672, as\nwell as $1,035,105 of net cash used to fund changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. Our cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nwas primarily attributable to our net loss of $18,708,007, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $578,437 as well as $1,461,235 of net cash provided by\nchanges in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. A significant portion of the non-cash expenses during the period relates to approximately $9.1 million of non-recurring\nexpenses associated with the impairment of IP R&D assets (see Note 3 – IP R&D, under “Part I – Item 1. Financial Statements” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements), as well as a decrease in the deferred tax benefit in the amount of $2.3 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was $1,005,367 and cash provided by financing activities was $4,439,526 for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to repayments of loans in the amount of\n$1,005,856, offset by proceeds of $489 from the exercise of pre-funded warrants related to the Amendment to the August 2023 Offering (defined and described below under\n“Prior Financial Transactions—Amendment to August 2023 Offering”). Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to net\nproceeds of $5,424,701 from the April 2023 Offering and August 2023 Offering, partially offset by the repayment of loans in the amount of $985,175.\nOur product candidates may never achieve commercialization and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our\nresearch and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase. As a result, until such time, if ever, as we are able\nto generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including\npotentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if\naccomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-\nparty clinical research and development services, license payments or milestone obligations that may arise, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, potential\nmanufacturing costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. In addition, we expect that the online casino assets that were acquired in September 2024\nwill be operational and ready to be launched between the first and second quarter of 2025.\nOur material cash requirements and time periods of such requirements from known contractual and other obligations include milestone and royalty payments related to\nlicense agreements with Oxford University and Yissum, payments related to the director and officer insurance, payments to consultants and payments related to outside\nconsulting firms, such as legal counsel, auditors, accountants, etc. As to the online casino, we expect that the cash requirements include front end development, purchase and\nleasing of games, integration of games, data capture and interpretation, currency management, cybersecurity and back office tracking of activity. These cash requirements, in\nthe aggregate, are expected to amount to approximately $750,000 for the remainder of 2024 and $2,000,000 for 2025.\nFurther, our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research\nand development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the\ndevelopment and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with\nour current and anticipated product development programs.\n47\nWe have not yet achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur cash outflows from operations. It is expected that our research and development and general and\nadministrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will eventually need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfunds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms.\nOur operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe conditions outlined above indicated that there was a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statement issuance\ndate. While the Company raised money in August 2021, July 2022, December 2022 and April 2023, August 2023 and November 2023 (see Note 2 – Going Concern and\nManagement’s Plans); on April 16, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company $2.27 million in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and\nGeorge Hornig for indemnification as former officers and directors, of which the Company received $1.5 million after the payment of attorney’s fees; on May 9, 2024, AmTrust\npaid the Company an additional $300,140 in reimbursement of fees which the Company had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig, of which the Company\nreceived $200,093 after the payment of attorneys’ fees; pursuant to the terms of a settlement with Freedom and the Company, Freedom agreed to pay $125,000 to the Company,\nof which the Company received approximately $83,333 after the payment of legal fees in August 2024; on September 23, 2024, Freedom paid the Company a further $125,000\nin reimbursement of fees advanced by the Company, of which the Company received $76,639 after the payment of attorney’s fees; and in October 2024, the Company received\n$3,320,331 before deducting financial advisory fees and other expenses payable by us in connection with the exercise of the Existing Warrants (see Note 13 to the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements included above under “Part I – Financial Information” – “Item 1. Financial Statements”), we expect to require additional funding\nin the future and there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional needed capital or that such capital will be available under favorable terms. In the event that we do\nraise capital in the future, we anticipate it being from the sale of equity which may cause dilution to existing stockholders. With current cash on hand of approximately $3.3\nmillion as of October 23, 2024, the Company expects to be able to continue as a going concern through December 2025.\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\n(“U.S. GAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement\nvalues. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nPrior Financing Transactions\nApril 2023 Offering\nOn April 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of\n21,053 shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 61,615 shares of common stock (“April 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”), and common\nstock warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 82,668 shares of common stock (the “April 2023 Common Warrants”), at a combined purchase price of $36.29 per share and\nwarrant (the “April 2023 Offering”). Aggregate gross proceeds from the April 2023 Offering were $2,999,882. Net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting\nthe placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $2.7 million. The placement agent fees and offering expenses of\napproximately $300,000 were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The April 2023 Offering closed on April 10, 2023.\nAugust 2023 Offering\nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor (the “Purchaser”), in addition to certain purchasers who\nrelied on the Company’s registration statement filed with the SEC on July 25, 2023, which became effective on August 9, 2023, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell\nan aggregate of 35,102 shares of common stock (the “August 2023 Shares”), pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 207,814 shares of common stock (“August\n2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”), and common stock warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 242,915 shares of common stock (the “August 2023 Common Warrants”), at a\ncombined purchase price of $12.35 per share and warrant (the “August 2023 Offering”). Aggregate gross proceeds from the August 2023 Offering were $2,999,606. Net\nproceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting the placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $2.7 million.\nThe placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately $300,000 were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The August 2023 Offering closed on\nAugust 14, 2023.\n48\nAmendment to August 2023 Offering\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq, stating that Nasdaq had determined that the Company failed to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder\napproval requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5635(d), which requires prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving the issuance of 20%\nor more of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the Minimum Price. The letter from Nasdaq referred to the August 2023 Offering and requested the Company to\nsubmit a plan of compliance no later than November 27, 2023. On November 9, 2023, the Company submitted a plan of compliance to Nasdaq, and on November 14, 2023,\nNasdaq provided a letter of extension to the Company.\nPursuant to the compliance plan submitted to Nasdaq, on November 28, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the August 2023 Offering (“Amendment to\nthe August 2023 Offering”), whereby (i) the Purchaser agreed to pay an additional $830,769 in connection with the repricing of the August 2023 Shares and August 2023 Pre-\nFunded Warrants (the “Repricing Amount”), (ii) the Company agreed to issue to the Purchaser additional pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 257,205 shares of common\nstock, with an exercise price of $0.0019 per share (the “Additional Pre- Funded Warrants”), and warrants to purchase up to 477,058 shares of common stock, with an exercise\nprice of $3.23 per share (the “Additional Common Warrants”, and collectively with the Additional Pre-Funded Warrants, the “Additional Warrants”), and (iii) the Company and\nthe Purchaser agreed to enter into a warrant amendment agreement (as described below). Net proceeds to the Company from the repricing, after deducting the placement agent\nfees and other offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $0.8 million. The placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately $60,000 were\naccounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The Amendment to the August 2023 Offering closed on December 1, 2023.\nIn accordance with the Amendment to the August 2023 Offering, the Company entered into a warrant amendment agreement to amend the following outstanding\nwarrants held by the Purchaser: (i) warrants to purchase up to 16,138 shares of common stock issued in July 2022; (ii) warrants to purchase up to 135,339 shares of common\nstock issued in December 2022; (iii) warrants to purchase up to 82,668 shares of common stock issued in April 2023; and (iv) warrants to purchase up to 242,915 shares of\ncommon stock issued in August 2023 (collectively, the “Existing Common Warrants”). Pursuant to the warrant amendment agreement, the Existing Common Warrants were not\nexercisable until the Company obtained stockholder approval for the issuance of up to 477,058 shares of common stock upon exercise of the Existing Common Warrants. The\nExisting Common Warrants have an exercise price equal to $3.23 per share, and the Existing Common Warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of the stockholder approval\ndate, February 16, 2024.\nWarrant Inducement Agreement and Related Transactions\nOn October 16, 2024, we entered into a warrant inducement agreement (the “Inducement Agreement”) with a holder (the “Holder”) of 477,058 Additional Common\nWarrants and 473,011 of the Existing Common Warrants (collectively, the “Exercised Warrants”), pursuant to which the Holder agreed to exercise for cash the Exercised\nWarrants to purchase 950,069 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.48 per share ($0.25 greater than the $3.23 per share exercise price of such Exercised Warrants)\nduring the period from the date of the Inducement Agreement until 1:15 p.m., Eastern Time, on October 16, 2024. On October 16 and 17, 2024, the Exercised Warrants were\nexercised in full for cash by the Holder and the Company received $3,306,240 before deducting financial advisory fees and other expenses payable by us.\nIn consideration of the Holder’s agreement to exercise the Exercised Warrants in accordance with the Inducement Agreement, the Company agreed to issue new\nunregistered Warrants to Purchase Shares of Common Stock (the “New Warrants”) to purchase a number of shares of common stock equal to 200% of the number of shares of\ncommon stock issued upon exercise of the Exercised Warrants, i.e., warrants to purchase up to 1,900,138 shares of common stock (the “New Warrant Shares”). The New\nWarrants were immediately exercisable and have a term of exercise of five years.\n49\nThe Company agreed in the Inducement Agreement to file a registration statement on Form S-1 to register the resale of the New Warrant Shares upon exercise of the\nNew Warrants (the “Resale Registration Statement”) by November 15, 2024, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to have such Resale Registration Statement declared\neffective by the Commission within sixty (60) calendar days following the date of filing with the Commission (or ninety (90) calendar days following the date of filing with the\nCommission in the event of a ‘full review’ by the Commission) and to keep the Resale Registration Statement effective at all times until no holder of the New Warrants owns\nany New Warrants or New Warrant Shares. In the event that the Company fails to timely deliver to the Holder the New Warrant Shares without restrictive legends, the Company\nhas agreed to pay certain liquidated damages to the Holder.\nThe Company expects to use the net proceeds from these transactions to advance the commercialization of the technology gaming platform recently acquired by the\nCompany, and for working capital, and other general corporate purposes.\nThe New Warrants will have an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of each New\nWarrant are subject to appropriate adjustments in the event of certain stock dividends and distributions, stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or similar events\naffecting the common stock. In addition, in certain circumstances, upon a fundamental transaction, a holder of New Warrants will be entitled to receive, upon exercise of the\nNew Warrants, the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that such holder would have received had they exercised the New Warrants immediately prior to the\nfundamental transaction.\nThe Company may not affect the exercise of New Warrants, and the applicable Holder will not be entitled to exercise any portion of any such New Warrant, which,\nupon giving effect to such exercise, would cause the aggregate number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by the holder of such New Warrant (together with its\naffiliates) to exceed 4.99% or 9.99%, as applicable, of the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage\nownership is determined in accordance with the terms of such New Warrants.\nThe Company engaged A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (“A.G.P.”) to provide exclusive financial services in connection with the transactions summarized above and,\npursuant to a Financial Advisory Agreement between the Company and A.G.P., paid A.G.P. a financial advisory fee of $232,000, an alternative transaction fee of $100,000. In\naddition, we reimbursed A.G.P. for its accountable legal expenses in connection with the exercise of the Exercised Warrants and the issuance of the New Warrants of $65,000\nand $10,000 non-accountable expenses. In addition, we paid A.G.P. $29,923.08 half of the financial advisory fees due in connection with a December 2023 warrant inducement.\nAs of October 31, 2024, a total of $436,923 related to the aforementioned transaction has been paid to A.G.P and there is no balance outstanding.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States.\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of its assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expenses. The Company has identified certain estimates as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its past or present results of\noperations related to intangible assets. These estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. The Company believes\nthat the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were\nmade. However, actual results may differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of source code and intellectual property relating to an online blockchain casino acquired on September 29, 2024 (the Purchased Assets) and\nlicensed patents held by Katexco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as well as technology licenses acquired in connection with the July 2019, corporate restructuring\ncompleted between the Company and each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma, pursuant to which each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma became wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries of the Company (the “Reorganization”). The casino technology and intellectual property is amortized over an estimated useful life of three years. Licensed patents\nare amortized over the remaining life of the patent. Technology licenses represent the fair value of licenses acquired for the development and commercialization of certain\nlicenses and knowledge. The technology licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the underlying patents. It will be necessary to monitor\nand possibly adjust the useful lives of the licensed patents and technology licenses depending on the results of the Company’s research and development activities.\n50\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the\nCompany’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nPursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting\ncompany,” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1).\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established and maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\ndisclosed in our reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and\nforms of the Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) (principal\nexecutive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) (principal financial and accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nThe Company’s management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report.\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the\nfact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their\ncosts.\nBased on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were not effective to provide assurance at a reasonable level that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosures as of September 30, 2024.\nManagement’s evaluation was based on the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting:\n● Ineffective controls: The Company’s review and control procedures did not operate at the appropriate level of precision to determine that reversals of year-end\nbonus accruals related to a discontinued R&D project should have been recorded as the forgiveness of a liability, and therefore a reduction in Other Income on the\nincome statement, as opposed to a reduction to R&D expense.\n51\nA material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the\nannual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a company with limited accounting resources, a significant amount of\nmanagement’s time and attention has been and will be diverted from our business to ensure compliance with these regulatory requirements.\nOur management plans to establish procedures to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is\ncommitted to taking further action and implementing necessary enhancements or improvements. Management expects to complete an assessment of the design and operating\neffectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nRemediation Plan\nManagement continues to take steps to develop and enhance its internal controls over financial reporting, and has implemented the following controls to remediate the\nabove material weakness:\n● Implement an added layer of technical review by an internal financial reporting director for one time significant entries to ensure appropriate classification is\nassessed.\nManagement will consider the material weakness to be fully remediated once the controls have been operating effectively for sufficient contiguous reporting periods,\nand after Management has validated the effective operation of the controls through testing.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls\ncan provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based\nin part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential\nfuture conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n52\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. The impact and outcome of litigation, if any, is subject to inherent\nuncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We believe the ultimate resolution of any such current\nproceeding will not have a material adverse effect on our continued financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSuch current litigation or other legal proceedings are described in, and incorporated by reference in, this “Item 1. Legal Proceedings” of this Form 10-Q from, “Part I –\nItem 1. Financial Statements” in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in “Note 10 – Commitments and Contingences”, under the heading Legal Matters.\nThe Company believes that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or\nresults of operations. However, assessment of the current litigation or other legal claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known to the Company or\nby judges, juries or other finders of fact, which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.\nAdditionally, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in\nexcess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, as filed with the Commission on March 25, 2024, under the heading “Risk Factors”, which risk factors are incorporated by reference herein, except as\ndiscussed below, and investors should review the risks provided in the Form 10-K and below, prior to making an investment in the Company. The business, financial condition\nand operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in the Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2023, under “Risk Factors” and below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company’s actual financial\ncondition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nGeneral Business and Funding Risks\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders\nof a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nAs of the date of this Report, we had 22,891 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, with a weighted average exercise price\nof $61.92 per share; (a) 15,132 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding public warrants exercisable at an exercise price of $4,370.00 per share,\n(b) 6,748 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain outstanding private placement warrants at an exercise price of $1,900.00 per share, (d) 6,579 shares of\ncommon stock issuable upon the exercise of certain outstanding private placement warrants at an exercise price of $2,850.00 per share, (e) 4,049 shares of common stock\nissuable upon exercise of certain outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.23 per share, (f) 3,000,000 shares of common stock\nissuable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.68 per share, (g) 168 shares of common stock issuable upon\nexercise of warrants which expire on May 2, 2025, and (h) 1,900,138 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share; and up to a maximum of 10,000,000\nshares of common stock issuable upon conversion of 1,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.\n53\nThe exercise of such outstanding options or warrants or the conversion of outstanding convertible securities will result in further dilution of your investment. If our\nexisting stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse\nimpact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nOur current cash balance is only expected to be sufficient to fund our planned business operations until approximately December 2025. If additional capital is not\navailable, we may not be able to pursue our planned business operations, may be forced to change our planned business operations, or may take other actions that could\nadversely impact our stockholders, including seeking bankruptcy protection.\nWe are a clinical stage biotechnology company that is transitioning into the iGaming industry which currently has no revenue. Thus, our business does not generate the\ncash necessary to finance our planned business operations. We will require significant additional capital to: (i) protect our intellectual property; (ii) attract and retain highly-\nqualified personnel; (iii) respond effectively to competitive pressures; and (iv) acquire complementary businesses or technologies.\nOur future capital needs depend on many factors, including: (i) the scope, duration and expenditures associated with our research, development and commercialization\nefforts as they relate to iGaming; (ii) the outcome of potential partnering or licensing transactions, if any; (iii) competing technological developments with regards to our\niGaming platform; and (iv) protecting and supporting our proprietary patent positions.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to finance\nour planned business operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. General market conditions, rising interest rates and\ninflation, as well as global conflicts such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and Israel and Hamas, may make it difficult for us to seek financing from the\ncapital markets, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity\nsecurities, further dilution to our stockholders will result, which may substantially dilute the value of their investment. Any equity financing may also have the effect of\nreducing the conversion or exercise price of our outstanding convertible or exercisable securities, which could result in the issuance (or potential issuance) of a significant\nnumber of additional shares of our common stock. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights\nsuperior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility to conduct future business activities and,\nin the event of insolvency, could be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of our assets. We may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies\nor product candidates, or grant licenses through alliance, joint venture or agreements on terms that are not favorable to us, in order to raise additional funds. Our current cash\nbalance is only expected to be sufficient to fund our planned business operations until approximately December 2025. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to\ndelay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities with respect to our business, or terminate our operations, or may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection. These\nactions would likely reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe will need additional capital which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, which raises questions about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nThe Company has not generated any revenues and has incurred significant losses since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit\nof $129,238,340 and a working capital deficit of $5,158,449, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a net loss of $1,894,683 and cash used in operating activities\nof $529,906. The Company expects to invest a significant amount of capital to commercialize its iGaming assets and fund research and development. On September 29, 2024,\nthe Company acquired certain source code and intellectual property relating to an online blockchain casino and plans to build and launch a fully operational casino operation as\npart of its future operations. The Company expects to invest a significant amount of capital to fund the development and operation of this business. As a result, the Company\nexpects that its operating expenses will increase significantly, and consequently will require significant revenues to become profitable. Even if the Company does become\nprofitable, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company cannot predict when, if ever, it will be profitable. As of November\n14, 2024, we had cash on hand of approximately $2.7 million, which we expect will last us until December 2025. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have\nbeen prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. As we are not generating revenues, we need to raise a significant amount of capital in order to pay our debts and\ncover our operating costs. While we have raised funds in the past through debt and the sale of equity, there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional needed capital\nor that such capital will be available under favorable terms.\n54\nWe are subject to all the substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the absence of a\nlong-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating losses until we can successfully implement our business\nstrategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. We may never achieve profitable operations or generate significant revenues.\nWe currently have a monthly cash requirement spend of approximately $200,000. We believe that in the aggregate, we will require significant additional capital\nfunding to support and expand our iGaming assets, the research and development and marketing of our products, fund future clinical trials, repay debt obligations, provide\ncapital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs, payment obligations, office space and systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs\nuntil our planned revenue streams from products are fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs, if ever.\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations with the proceeds from equity and debt financing. We have experienced liquidity issues due to, among other\nreasons, our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the sale of equity and debt funding that is convertible into shares of\nour common stock to fund our operations and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that exposure. We anticipate that we will need to issue equity to fund our operations and\nfund our operating expenses for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to achieve operational profitability or we are not successful in securing other forms of financing, we\nwill have to evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of\nliabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of\nassets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein also\ninclude a going concern footnote.\nAdditionally, wherever possible, the Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-\ncash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors has\nauthority, without action or vote of the stockholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which\nwould result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock,\nsubject to certain exceptions), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock.\nIn addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the\nownership interests of existing stockholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing\nmanagement’s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nOur accounts payable are significant, and we do not currently have sufficient funds to pay such accounts payable, a large portion of which are past due.\nWe do not currently have adequate cash on hand, and do not expect to generate revenues, sufficient to pay down our significant accounts payable balance. A large\nportion of our accounts payable balance represents amounts which are past due. While we are actively working with creditors to attempt to satisfy amounts owed in shares of\ncommon stock, the issuance of which may cause dilution to existing stockholders, there can be no assurance that such creditors will agree to accept equity in lieu of cash. Such\ncreditors may in the future exercise remedies, including suing the Company for nonpayment or attempting to force the Company into receivership. Creditor litigation may be\ncostly and resource intensive, which could deplete our already limited available cash and/or force us to raise additional funding, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders\nor seek bankruptcy protection. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding or insolvency, or restructuring of our capital structure, holders of the Company’s common stock could\nsuffer a total loss of their investment.\n55\nWe will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, causing dilution to our stockholders, restricting our operations or\nadversely affecting our ability to operate our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, including as a result of macroeconomic conditions such as a severe or prolonged\neconomic downturn. Disruption, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets could increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to raise funds needed to operate our\nbusiness. Disruptions could be caused by Federal Reserve policies and actions, currency concerns, inflation, economic downturn or uncertainty, monetary policies, failures of\nfinancial institutions, U.S. debt management concerns, and U.S. debt limit and budget disputes, including government shutdowns, European and worldwide sovereign debt\nconcerns, other global or geopolitical events, or other factors. Current macroeconomic conditions have negatively impacted the U.S. banking sector, including for example, the\nrecent closures and FDIC receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Although we do not have any accounts at or business relationships with these banks, we\nmay be negatively impacted by other disruptions to the U.S. banking system caused by these or similar developments.\nWe recently purchased intellectual property and source code relating to the backend of an online casino; however, we have no experience operating in the gaming\nindustry and may not be successful in this endeavor. We also need to purchase or develop a front end for our online casino intellectual property.\nAs described in greater detail above under “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Overview—\nPlanned iGaming Casino Operations—Asset Purchase Agreement”, on September 30, 2024, we completed the acquisition of source code and intellectual property relating to\nthe backend of an online blockchain casino. Neither we, nor our officers, have significant experience in operating an online casino, provided that our current Chief Financial\nOfficer previously served as Chief Financial Officer of an online gaming company. We may not be able to retain, hire or train personnel as quickly or efficiently as we need or\non terms that are acceptable to us. An inability to efficiently operate our businesses would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of\noperations, and prospects.\nAdditionally, before being able to monetize the acquired assets we will need to either purchase or create a front end for the online casino and obtain required permits\nand licenses. The purchase or creation of such front end may be more time consuming or expensive than we anticipate, and we may never generate significant revenues from\nsuch assets or operations. Additionally, it may be difficult, costly or too time consuming to obtain required licenses and permits, and as a result, we may never generate\nrevenues through such acquisition.\nWe depend on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. We are highly dependent on our current management,\nincluding our Interim Chief Executive Officer, Blair Jordan and our Chief Financial Officer, Omar Jimenez. The inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel\ncould adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. The competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may be unable to\ncontinue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\n56\nOur industry and the broader U.S. economy have experienced higher than expected inflationary pressures during 2022 and 2023, related to continued supply\nchain disruptions, labor shortages and geopolitical instability. Should these conditions persist, our business, future results of operations and cash flows could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nDuring 2022 and the early part of 2023, there were significant increases in the costs of certain materials, products and shipping costs, as a result of availability\nconstraints, supply chain disruption, increased demand, labor shortages associated with a fully employed U.S. labor force, high inflation and other factors. Supply and demand\nfundamentals have been further aggravated by disruptions in global energy supply caused by multiple geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and\nUkraine, and Israel and Hamas, which threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries. Service, materials and shipping costs have also increased accordingly with general\nsupply chain and inflation issues seen throughout the U.S. leading to increased operating costs. Supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures have in the past and may in\nthe future, adversely impact our operating costs and may negatively impact our future product costs, consulting costs and expenses which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur License Agreements with the University of Oxford and other licensors may be terminated in certain circumstances without our consent.\nAll of our License Agreements with the University of Oxford and other licensors remain subject to various conditions and covenants, and provide for certain\ntermination rights to the licensors. Those agreements typically allow termination by the licensor for our failure to pay amounts due timely, our failure to cure a material breach\nunder the terms of the applicable license agreement, our insolvency, and certain changes in our operations, including operating in areas or industries which Oxford deems\noutside of its guidelines, including the gambling industry. As a result, if we are deemed insolvent, or in the event we seek bankruptcy protection, or we continue to operate in\nthe gambling industry, the licensors of our license agreements may terminate their license agreements with us. In the event such license agreements are terminated, we could\nlose the right to develop all of our platforms and technologies, may lose any investments made towards developing such platforms and technologies, and may be left without\nany intellectual property, product pathways, or development opportunities. Such terminations may result in the value of our securities declining in value or becoming worthless,\nthe need for us to change our business plan, and may result in the Company seeking bankruptcy protection.\nWe owe a significant amount of money to the University of Oxford, which funds we do not have. The university may take action against us to enforce their rights\nto payment in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations.\nDue to recent financial constraints, the Company has been unable to timely pay amounts due to the University of Oxford (“Oxford”), the licensor of the majority of the\nCompany’s licenses and patents and the Company’s research partner. Oxford alleges that an aggregate of approximately $1.3 million is owed from the Company and one of its\nsubsidiaries to Oxford under the terms of licenses and agreements with Oxford and related parties. The Company is currently in ongoing discussions with Oxford to reduce that\namount and enter into a payment plan with regards to the amounts owed; however, no definitive terms or extensions have been agreed to date. Oxford has also notified the\nCompany that it is not willing to discuss any new projects or arrangements until all outstanding invoices have been paid or a payment plan has been agreed to; has engaged a\nlaw firm to seek the collection of the amounts owed, together with interest; and has threatened legal proceedings against us. While we are hopeful that we can come to mutually\nagreeable terms regarding a settlement, payment plan, and/or extension, with Oxford, we may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due to Oxford in the near term, if at all,\nand Oxford may take action against us, including filing legal proceedings against us seeking amounts due and interest, attempting to terminate their relationship with us, and/or\nfiling a wind-up petition against one of the Company’s subsidiaries in the U.K. If Oxford were to take legal action against us or terminate their relationship with us, we may be\nforced to scale back our business plan and/or seek bankruptcy protection. We may be subject to litigation and damages for our failure to pay amounts due to Oxford, and may be\nforced to pay interest and penalties, which funds we do not currently have. We plan to seek to raise funding in the future to support our operations, and to pay amounts due to\nOxford, through a combination of equity offerings, debt financing or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements, which\nmay not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. The Company\nbelieves that due to the Company’s move into the online gaming/casino industry, Oxford may face certain additional challenges and constraints in continuing its contractual\nrelationship with the Company due to potential Economic, Social and Governance restrictions imposed by Oxford. Such challenges and constrains may result in Oxford\nterminating or otherwise exiting its contractual relationship with the Company, potentially with limited notice or recourse by the Company, including terminating prior licenses,\nwhile seeking immediate repayment of amounts currently due.\n57\nWe may not receive any further amount under our pre-merger directors’ and officers’ insurance policy in connection with certain litigation matters.\nOn June 29, 2022, AmTrust International Underwriters DAC (“AmTrust”), which was the premerger directors’ and officers’ insurance policy underwriter for KBL,\nfiled a declaratory relief action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Declaratory Relief Action”) seeking declaration of AmTrust’s\nobligations under the directors’ and officers’ insurance policy. In the Declaratory Relief Action, AmTrust is claiming that as a result of the merger, we are no longer the insured\nunder the subject insurance policy, notwithstanding the fact that the fees which we seek to recover from AmTrust relate to matters occurring prior to the merger. The parties\nfiled various answers and the Company filed counterclaims against AmTrust between September 2022 and November 2022, when the Company filed a Motion for Summary\nAdjudication against both AmTrust and Freedom. The Motion was fully briefed and a hearing was held on March 9, 2023. The standard to prevail on a Motion for Summary\nAdjudication in the Court is high to prevail and requires a judge to find that there are no disputed issues of fact so that they can rule on the issues as a matter of law. In this\ninstance the judge found three major issues could be decided as a matter of law in the Company’s favor and that one issue, the Change in Control exclusion, requires further\ndiscovery.\nOn April 21, 2023, the Court issued an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Specifically, the Court\ngranted summary adjudication in favor of the Company on the following issues: (a) that the Company is, in fact, an insured under both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance\npolicies; (b) that certain SEC subpoena related expenses for defendants Dr. Marlene Krauss, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Director, and George Hornig,\nthe former Chairman of the Board, are within the basic scope of coverage under both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; and (c) that the Insured vs. Insured\nexclusion relied upon by AmTrust and Freedom is not applicable to bar any such coverage.\nThe Court also found that there were issues of disputed facts as to the Change in Control exclusion contained within the policies, which therefore precluded the Court\nfrom granting the remainder of the Company’s requests for summary adjudication as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court, at this time, denied the Company’s further requests\nfor summary adjudication and deemed that for the time being, the Change in Control issue is to be determined at the time of trial, in order to find that the policies provide\n(i) coverage for the fees which the Company has advanced and will advance to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig; (ii) that AmTrust has breached the policy; (iii) that\nAmTrust must pay such expenses of the Company; and that, once the AmTrust policy has been exhausted, (iv) that Freedom will be obligated to pay such expenses of the\nCompany pursuant to its policy.\nOn August 4, 2023, the Court granted the Company’s request to file a second motion for partial summary judgment in this case, this one being on the issue of whether\nAmTrust should be required to advance to the Company the defense costs being incurred by Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig during the pendency of the case. The\nCompany filed such Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and it has now been fully briefed by the parties. The hearing for such motion was held on January 11, 2024. After\nthe matter was taken under submission, on February 12, 2024, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against both AmTrust and Freedom, and\nordered as follows: (a) AmTrust is obligated under its insurance policy with the Company to advance to the Company all defense costs in excess of the deductible that the\nCompany has advanced, or will advance, to Dr. Krauss and Mr. Hornig in connection with certain SEC Subpoenas, and (b) upon exhaustion of the AmTrust insurance policy,\nFreedom is obligated to do the same pursuant to its excess liability insurance policy with the Company. This Order applies throughout the interim of the case, but does not\nconstitute a final judgment, and both the Company and the two insurers retain their rights to contest all applicable issues at trial, which is scheduled for May 12, 2025. A final\njudgment following trial could potentially confirm these obligations of the insurers or, alternatively, reverse and require the Company to repay all or portions of such advance\npayments. There is no assurance at this time as to what the final judgment may entail.\n58\nOn April 16, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company $2.27 million in reimbursement of fees which the Company has advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig,\nof which the Company received $1.5 million after the payment of attorney’s fees. On May 9, 2024, AmTrust paid the Company $300,140 in reimbursement of fees which the\nCompany had advanced to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig, of which the Company has received $200,093 after the payment of attorney’s fees.\nThe Company, Freedom and Amtrust held a mediation conference on August 21, 2024, during which, the Company agreed to the terms of a settlement with Freedom,\npursuant to which Freedom agreed to pay $125,000 to the Company, of which the Company received approximately $83,333 after the payment of legal fees.\nAmtrust and the Company have commenced written discovery proceedings against each other and anticipate that depositions will also occur. The Company intends to\ncontinue to vigorously pursue this matter in order to establish the Company’s entitlement to full and final payment by AmTrust of the subject advancement expenses of the\nCompany. While the Company continues to believe it has a strong case against AmTrust, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this action. The final\noutcome of the litigation is unknown at this time and such final outcome could be materially adverse to the Company.\nIf we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we make acquisitions in the future, funding permitting, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired\ncompany’s assets, personnel and operations with our own. We do not anticipate that any acquisitions or mergers we may enter into in the future would result in a change of\ncontrol of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core\nbusiness. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and\nincrease our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n● the difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;\n● the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n● difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n● the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n● the potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross-marketing of the products to new and existing customers;\n● the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired;\n● potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the\nmarketing and sales of acquired products or operations, or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company\nprior to our acquisition; and\n● potential expenses under the labor, environmental and other laws of various jurisdictions.\n59\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection\nwith an acquisition, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees,\nincrease our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nClaims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to, and expect to continue to be regularly subject to, actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings. In\naddition, we have filed lawsuits against certain parties for matters we discovered which related to KBL, prior to the November 6, 2020, business combination. Any of these\ntypes of proceedings may have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other\nfactors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves and possible losses from such matters\ninvolves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in\nexcess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a\nmaterial effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings,\nincluding as a result of a settlement, could require us to make substantial future payments, prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our\nbusiness practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our\nreputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.\nRisks Relating to our Planned Online Casino Operations\nWe have no operating history in the gaming industry and have incurred significant operating losses since inception. We may never become profitable or, if\nachieved, be able to sustain profitability.\nWe have no operating history in the gaming industry upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that our gaming operations will prove successful, and we\nmay never achieve profitable operations. We currently expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. Even if we do achieve profitability, there can be no guarantee that we\nwill be able to sustain profitability. As a result of the acquisition of certain blockchain casino intellectual property, we plan to focus a portion of our attention on the online\ngaming industry, and we have limited experience in that industry. If we are unsuccessful in operating our business, it will have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nThe online gaming industry is highly competitive, and if the Company fails to compete effectively, it could experience price reductions, reduced margins or loss of\nrevenues.\nThe online gaming industry is highly competitive. A number of companies offer products and services that are similar to the Company’s planned online casino. The\nmajority of the Company’s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources, greater name\nrecognition, broader or more integrated product offerings, larger technical staffs and a larger installed customer base. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to\nnew or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, develop superior products, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of online\ngaming operations than the Company can.\nBecause of the rapid growth of the gaming industry, and the relatively low capital barriers to entry in the software industry, the Company expects additional\ncompetition from other established and emerging companies. Additionally, the Company’s competitors could combine or merge to become more formidable competitors or may\nadapt more quickly than we can to new technologies, evolving industry trends and changing customer requirements.\n60\nCompetition within the global entertainment and gaming industries is intense and the future offerings of the Company may not be able to compete against other\ncompeting forms of entertainment such as television, movies and sporting events, as well as other entertainment and gaming options on the Internet. If the\nCompany’s offerings are not popular, the Company’s business could be harmed.\nThe Company plans to begin operating in the global gaming industry. The users of the Company’s planned online casino offering will face a vast array of\nentertainment choices. Other forms of entertainment, such as television, movies, sporting events and in-person casinos, are more well established and may be perceived by\nusers to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and enjoyment. The Company’s planned products and services will compete with these other forms of entertainment for\nthe discretionary time and income of end users. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in the Company’s planned products, services and offerings in comparison to other\nforms of entertainment, including new forms of entertainment, the Company’s business model may not be viable.\nThe Company will face the risk of fraud, theft, and cheating.\nThe Company will face the risk that third-parties, employees or consultants may attempt or commit fraud or theft or cheat using the Company’s products. Such risks\ninclude backdoors, nefarious code and other efforts. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in the Company’s operations and those of\nthe Company’s future customers. Negative publicity related to such acts or schemes could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, potentially causing a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business.\nThe Company will rely on third party cloud services and such providers or services may encounter technical problems and service interruptions.\nThe Company expects to host its future services on a combination of proprietary and cloud servers. Such servers have in the past and may in the future experience\nslower response times or interruptions as a result of increased traffic or other reasons. The Company will not have control over the operations of the facilities or infrastructure\nof the third-party service providers that they use. Such third parties’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist\nattacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. We expect that the continuing and uninterrupted performance of the Company’s platform will be critical to our\nsuccess. The Company may experience, interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from these third-party service providers from time to time due to a variety\nof factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in these third parties’\nservice levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of the Company’s users. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is expected to\nbe critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our offerings. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve\nour performance, especially during peak usage times, as the Company expands, and the usage of our offerings increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions\ncould harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our offerings. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, reduce the\navailability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new customers, any of which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMalfunctions of third-party communications infrastructure, hardware and software may expose the Company to a variety of risks it cannot control.\nThe business of the Company is expected to depend upon the capacity, reliability and security of the infrastructure owned by third parties over which the Company’s\nofferings are deployed. The Company has no control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of a significant portion of that infrastructure or whether or not those third\nparties will upgrade or improve their equipment. The Company instead will depend on these companies to maintain the operational integrity of their connections. If one or\nmore of these companies is unable or unwilling to supply or expand their levels of service in the future, the operations of the Company could be adversely impacted. Also, to\nthe extent the number of users of networks utilizing the Company’s future products and services suddenly increases, the technology platform and secure hosting services which\nwill be required to accommodate a higher volume of traffic may result in slower response times or service interruptions. System interruptions or increases in response time\ncould result in a loss of potential or existing users and, if sustained or repeated, could reduce the appeal of the networks to users. In addition, users depend on real-time\ncommunications; outages caused by increased traffic could result in delays and system failures. These types of occurrences could cause users to perceive that the products and\nservices of the Company do not function properly and could therefore adversely affect the Company’s ability to attract and retain licensees, strategic partners, and customers.\n61\nThe Company’s planned online casino is part of a new and evolving industry, which presents significant uncertainty and business risks.\nThe gaming platforms, systems and gaming content industries are relatively new and continue to evolve. Whether these industries grow and whether their business will\nultimately succeed, will be affected by, among other things, mobile platforms, legal and regulatory developments (such as passing new laws or regulations or extending existing\nlaws or regulations to online gaming and related activities), taxation of gaming activities, data and information privacy and payment processing laws and regulations, and other\nfactors that are unable to be predicted and which are beyond the control of the Company.\nGiven the dynamic evolution of these industries, it can be difficult to plan strategically, including as it relates to product launches in new or existing jurisdictions\nwhich may be delayed or denied, and it is possible that competitors will be more successful than the Company is at adapting to change and pursuing business opportunities.\nAdditionally, as the online gaming industry advances, including with respect to regulation in new and existing jurisdictions, the Company may become subject to additional\ncompliance-related costs, including regulatory infractions, licensing, and taxes. If our product offerings do not obtain popularity or maintain popularity, or if we fail to grow in a\nmanner that meets our expectations, or if we cannot offer product offerings in particular jurisdictions that may be material to our business, then our results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be harmed.\nAdditionally, possible future changes in governmental regulations pose material risks to the Company. These changes may include amendments to existing rules or the\nintroduction of new ones, shifts in regulatory focus or policy, or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of current rules and policies. These could lead to increased\ncompliance costs, restrictions or prohibitions on current operations, or required alterations to the way the Company’s then services are offered or marketed, any of which may\nresult in a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nFailure to comply with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction, or the failure to successfully obtain a license or permit applied for in a particular\njurisdiction, could impact the ability of the Company to comply with licensing and regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions, or could cause the rejection of license\napplications or cancellation of existing licenses in other jurisdictions.\nCompliance with the various regulations applicable to online gaming is costly and time-consuming. Regulatory authorities at the federal, state and local levels (both in\nthe U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions) have broad powers with respect to the regulation and licensing of real money online gaming operations and may revoke, suspend,\ncondition or limit the licenses of the Company, impose substantial fines on us, and take other actions, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and prospects. We do not currently hold any licenses and will need to obtain licenses in the future to operate our planned online\nblockchain casino. Such licenses may not be available in the timeframe we expect, may be more costly, or may require us to undertake various resource intensive actions to\nobtain. These laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or\nregulations or enact new laws and regulations regarding these matters. The Company strives to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to its business. It is\npossible, however, that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules.\nNon-compliance with any such law or regulations could expose the Company to claims, proceedings, litigation and investigations by private parties and regulatory authorities,\nas well as substantial fines and negative publicity, each of which may materially and adversely affect the business of the Company.\nThe future gaming licenses of the Company could be revoked, suspended or conditioned at any time. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a\nlicense or affect our eligibility for such a license in another jurisdiction, and any of such losses, or potential for such loss, could cause the Company to cease offering some or\nall of its offerings in the impacted jurisdictions. The Company may be unable to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals, and could incur\nfines or experience delays related to the licensing process, which could adversely affect its operations. The delay or failure to obtain or maintain licenses by the Company in\nany jurisdiction may prevent it from distributing its offerings, increasing its customer base and/or generating revenues. The Company may not be able to obtain and maintain\nthe licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct its operations. Any failure by the Company or its customers to maintain or renew existing licenses, registrations, permits\nor approvals could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the Company.\n62\nThe product offerings of the Company must be approved in most regulated jurisdictions in which they are offered; this process cannot be assured or guaranteed.\nIf the Company fails to obtain necessary gaming licenses in a given jurisdiction, we would likely be prohibited from distributing and providing our product offerings in\nthat particular jurisdiction. If we fail to seek, do not receive, or receive a suspension or revocation of a license in a particular jurisdiction for our product offerings (including\nany related technology and software) then we cannot offer the same in that jurisdiction and our gaming licenses in other jurisdictions may be impacted. Furthermore, some\njurisdictions require license holders to obtain government approval before engaging in some transactions. We may not be able to obtain all necessary licenses in a timely\nmanner, or at all. Delays in regulatory approvals or failure to obtain such approvals may also serve as a barrier to entry to the market for our product offerings. If the Company\nis unable to overcome the barriers to entry, it will materially affect our results of operations and future prospects.\nTo the extent new online gaming jurisdictions are established or expanded, the Company cannot guarantee it will be successful in penetrating such new jurisdictions or\nexpanding its business or customer base in line with the growth of existing jurisdictions. As the Company directly or indirectly enters into new markets, it may encounter legal,\nregulatory and political challenges that are difficult or impossible to foresee and which could result in an unforeseen adverse impact on planned revenues or costs associated\nwith the new market opportunity. If the Company is unable to effectively develop and operate directly or indirectly within these new markets or if its competitors are able to\nsuccessfully penetrate geographic markets that it cannot access or where it faces other restrictions, then the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition could\nbe impaired. The failure of the Company to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in jurisdictions, whether individually or collectively, would have a material\nadverse effect on its business.\nLegislative and regulatory changes could negatively affect the business of the Company and the business of its customers.\nLegislative and regulatory changes may affect demand for or place limitations on the Company’s future operations. Such changes could affect the Company in a variety\nof ways. Legislation or regulation may introduce limitations on their products or opportunities for the use of our products and could foster competitive products. Our business\nwill likely also suffer if our products become obsolete due to changes in laws or the regulatory framework. Moreover, legislation to prohibit, limit or add burdens to our\nbusiness may be introduced in the future in jurisdictions where gaming has been legalized. In addition, from time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed\nlegislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations or which may otherwise adversely impact our operations in the jurisdictions in which we then operate and\nwill operate in the future.\nLegislative or regulatory changes negatively impacting the gaming industry as a whole could also decrease the demand for our future products. Opposition to gaming\ncould result in restrictions or even prohibitions of gaming operations in any jurisdiction or could result in increased taxes on gaming revenues. Tax matters, including changes\nin state, federal or other tax legislation or assessments by tax authorities could have a negative impact on our business. A reduction in growth of the gaming industry or in the\nnumber of gaming jurisdictions or delays in the opening of new or expanded casinos could reduce demand for our products. Changes in current or future laws or regulations or\nfuture judicial intervention in any particular jurisdiction may have a material adverse effect on our existing and proposed foreign and domestic operations. Any such adverse\nchange in the legislative or regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n63\nThe gaming industry is highly regulated, and the Company must adhere to various regulations and maintain applicable licenses to operate. Failure to abide by\nregulations or maintain applicable licenses could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our operations.\nThe Company and its planned products are, and will be, subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations of the\njurisdictions in which we do business and our planned products are used. Such entities currently block direct access to wagering on websites from jurisdictions in which they do\nnot have a license to operate through IP address filtering. Individuals are required to enter their age upon gaining access to their platforms and any misrepresentation of such\nusers age will result in the forfeiting of his or her deposit and any withdrawals from such users account requires proof of government issued identification. In addition, payment\nservice providers use their own identify and internet service provider (ISP) verification software. Despite all such measures, it is conceivable that a user, underage, or otherwise\ncould devise a way to evade the Company’s blocking measures and access its website from the United States or any other foreign jurisdiction in which the Company is not then\npermitted to operate.\nViolations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. Licenses, approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked, suspended\nor conditioned. In sum, the Company may not be able to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations, licenses, permits or approvals. The licensing process may result in delays\nor adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain key personnel, and our efforts to comply with any new licensing regulations will increase our costs.\nA reduction in discretionary consumer spending, from an economic downturn or disruption of financial markets or other factors, could negatively impact the\nfinancial performance of the Company as it develops its iGaming business.\nGaming and other leisure activities that the Company plans to offer represent discretionary expenditures and players’ participation in those activities may decline if\ndiscretionary consumer spending declines, including during economic downturns, when consumers generally earn less disposable income. Changes in discretionary consumer\nspending or consumer preferences are driven by factors beyond the Company’s control, such as:\n● perceived or actual general economic conditions;\n● fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy;\n● high energy, fuel and other commodity costs;\n● the potential for bank failures or other financial crises;\n● a soft job market;\n● an actual or perceived decrease in disposable consumer income and wealth;\n● increases in taxes, including gaming taxes or fees; and\n● terrorist attacks or other global events.\nDuring periods of economic contraction, the Company may not be able to generate expected or any revenues, while most of the Company’s costs remain fixed and\nsome costs even increase, resulting in decreased earnings.\nThe Company will face cyber security risks that could result in damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject them to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits\nand restrictions on the Company’s use of data.\nThe information systems and data of the Company, including those the Company maintains with the Company’s third-party service providers, may be subject to cyber\nsecurity breaches in the future. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the Company’s network security and misappropriate, copy or pirate the\nCompany’s confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause interruptions or shutdowns of the Company’s internal systems and services. The\nCompany’s websites may become subject to denial-of-service attacks, where a website is bombarded with information requests eventually causing the website to overload,\nresulting in a delay or disruption of service. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs\nthat attack the Company’s products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of the Company’s products. Also, there is a growing trend of advanced persistent threats\nbeing launched by organized and coordinated groups against corporate networks to breach security for malicious purposes.\n64\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access to the Company’s systems, the Company’s data or customers’ data, disable or degrade service,\nor sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or\ndetected until after they have been launched. Although the Company has developed, and plans to develop, systems and processes designed to protect the Company’s data and\ncustomer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expects to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance\nthat these security measures will provide absolute security.\nDisruptions in the availability of their computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could damage our computer or telecommunications systems, impact our\nability to service our customers, adversely affect our operations and results of operations, and have an adverse effect on our reputation. The costs to eliminate or alleviate\nsecurity problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in\ninterruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of future customers and may impede our sales, distribution and other critical functions. We may also be subject to regulatory\npenalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information has been compromised, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and other Securities\nWe currently have an illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, and the market for our common stock is and may remain illiquid and volatile in the\nfuture.\nWe currently have a highly sporadic, illiquid and volatile market for our common stock, which market is anticipated to remain sporadic, illiquid and volatile in the\nfuture. During the last 52 weeks our common stock has traded as high as $17.75 per share and as low as $1.16 per share. The market price of our common stock may continue\nto be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Our financial performance, government regulatory action, tax laws, interest rates, and market conditions in general could\nhave a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock.\n● “short squeezes”;\n● comments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media;\n● large stockholders exiting their position in our securities or an increase or decrease in the short interest in our securities;\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;\n● changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n● the commencement, enrollment or results of our planned or future clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n65\n● the success of competitive drugs or therapies;\n● regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries;\n● the success of competitive products or technologies;\n● developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n● the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n● the level of expenses related to our iGaming operations, product candidates or clinical development programs;\n● litigation matters, including amounts which may or may not be recoverable pursuant to our officer and director insurance policies, regulatory actions affecting the\nCompany and the outcome thereof;\n● the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates;\n● actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n● our inability to obtain or delays in obtaining adequate drug supply for any approved drug or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n● disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n● the timing and outcome of our plans to commercialize our iGaming intellectual property;\n● significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n● variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n● changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems, including coverage and adequate reimbursement for any approved drug;\n● market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n● general economic, political, and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the financial markets in the U.S. and abroad; and\n● investors’ general perception of us and our business.\n66\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “ATNF.” Our stock price may be impacted by factors that are unrelated or\ndisproportionate to our operating performance. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of\nparticular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, general economic, political and market\nconditions, such as recessions, inflation, war, interest rates or international currency fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Due to the limited\nvolume of our shares which trade, we believe that our stock prices (bid, ask and closing prices) may not be related to our actual value, and not reflect the actual value of our\ncommon stock. You should exercise caution before making an investment in us.\nStock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, during 2022, the closing sales prices of our common stock ranged from a\npost-split adjusted high of $1,482.04 per share to a low of $23.56 per share, during fiscal 2023, the closing sales prices of our common stock ranged from a high of $100.70 per\nshare to a low of $3.21 per share and during fiscal 2024 (through the date of this Report), the closing sales prices of our common stock ranged from a post-split adjusted high of\n$6.47 per share to a low of $1.18 per share. During this time, we do not believe that we have experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of\noperations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume; however, we have sold equity which was dilutive to existing stockholders. These broad market\nfluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and\ndemand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise\nnegatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nAdditionally, as a result of the illiquidity of our common stock, investors may not be interested in owning our common stock because of the inability to acquire or sell\na substantial block of our common stock at one time. Such illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, a shareholder may not\nbe able to borrow funds using our common stock as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of securities having such a limited market. An active\ntrading market for our common stock may not develop or, if one develops, may not be sustained.\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the\ntarget of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns,\nwhich could seriously harm our business.\nInformation available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media may include\nstatements not attributable to us and may not be reliable or accurate.\nWe are aware of a large volume of information being disseminated by third parties relating to our operations, including in blogs, message boards and social and other\nmedia. Such information as reported by third parties may not be accurate, may lead to significant volatility in our securities and may ultimately result in our common stock or\nother securities declining in value.\nThe exercise of our outstanding options and warrants, and the sale of common stock upon exercise thereof, may adversely affect the trading price of our\nsecurities.\nAs of the date of this Report, we had 22,891 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, with a weighted average exercise price\nof $61.92 per share; (a) 15,132 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding public warrants exercisable at an exercise price of $4,370.00 per share,\n(b) 6,748 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain outstanding private placement warrants at an exercise price of $1,900.00 per share, (d) 6,579 shares of\ncommon stock issuable upon the exercise of certain outstanding private placement warrants at an exercise price of $2,850.00 per share, (e) 4,049 shares of common stock\nissuable upon exercise of certain outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.23 per share, (f) 3,000,000 shares of common stock\nissuable upon the exercise of warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $1.68 per share, (g) 168 shares of common stock issuable upon\nexercise of warrants which expire on May 2, 2025, and (h) 1,900,138 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase 1,900,138 shares of common\nstock with an exercise price of $1.50 per share. For the life of the options and warrants, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common\nstock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing\nstockholders.\n67\nThe availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot\npredict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect, if any, that\nfuture issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common\nstock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon exercise/conversion of outstanding convertible securities may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the\nmarket price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company’s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens\nthe price of our stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of\nour common stock cannot absorb shares sold by holders of our outstanding convertible securities, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nOur outstanding public warrants are significantly out of the money.\nEach Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-seven hundred sixtieth of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per 1/760th of one share\n($4,370.00 per whole share), subject to adjustment. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants became exercisable 12\nmonths from the closing of the IPO and expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination (November 6, 2025). The Public Warrants are significantly out of\nthe money and because no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants, the Public Warrants are only exercisable in multiples of 760. As a result, the\nPublic Warrants may not have any significant value. Additionally, warrant holders not holding at least 760 Public Warrants or who hold Public Warrants which would be\nexercisable for a fractional share of common stock, must sell any warrants to obtain value from the fractional interest. As a result, the trading of the Public Warrants may be\nlimited or sporadic, and such Public Warrants may not have any significant value. Any holder of Public Warrants holding less than 760 Public Warrants or a number of Public\nWarrants not evenly divisible by 760 will not receive any common stock upon the exercise of Public Warrants, as no fractional shares of common stock are issuable upon\nexercise thereof.\nProvisions of certain outstanding warrants could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nProvisions of certain outstanding warrants could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. Certain outstanding warrants prohibit us from\nengaging in certain transactions constituting “fundamental transactions” unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under each of the outstanding\nwarrants to purchase up to 17,376 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $3.23 per share (warrants to purchase 4,049 shares of common stock), $1,900 per share\n(warrants to purchase 6,748 shares of common stock) and $2,850 per share (warrants to purchase 6,579 shares of common stock). Further, such outstanding warrants provide\nthat, in the event of certain transactions constituting “fundamental transactions,” with some exception, holders of such warrants will have the right, at their option, to require us\nto repurchase such warrants at a price described in the applicable warrants (based on the Black Scholes Value of such warrants). These and other provisions of the warrants\ncould prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to stockholders.\nA significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock and cause significant\ndilution to existing stockholders.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Most of our common stock is\navailable for immediate resale in the public market, including (i) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 22,891 shares of common stock at a weighted average\nexercise price of $61.92 per share; and (ii) outstanding warrants to purchase 48,302 shares of common stock at exercises prices from between $3.23 and $4,370 per share. If a\nsignificant number of shares were sold, such sales would increase the supply of our common stock, thereby potentially causing a decrease in its price. Some or all of our shares\nof common stock may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to effective registration statements and/or compliance with Rule 144, which sales could have a\ndepressive effect on the market for our shares of common stock. Subject to certain restrictions, a person who has held restricted shares for a period of six months may generally\nsell common stock into the market. The sale of a significant portion of such shares when such shares are eligible for public sale may cause the value of our common stock to\ndecline in value.\n68\nThere may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their shares. The market price of our common stock may\ncontinue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock will likely continue to be highly volatile. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common stock\nare beyond our control, such as conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common stock. This situation is attributable to a number of factors,\nincluding the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that\ngenerate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company\nsuch as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable.\nAs a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a mature issuer which\nhas a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. It is possible that a broader or more active\npublic trading market for our common stock will not develop or be sustained, or that trading levels will not continue. These factors may materially adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock, regardless of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility\nhas significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These\nbroad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not in compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq and are subject to a one year mandatory panel monitor, and as a result our common\nstock and Public Warrants may be delisted from Nasdaq.\nOur common stock and Public Warrants trade on Nasdaq under the symbols “ATNF” and “ATNFW,” respectively. Notwithstanding such listing, there can be no\nassurance any broker will be interested in trading our securities. Therefore, it may be difficult to sell our securities publicly. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to\nmaintain our listings on Nasdaq for any period of time by perpetually satisfying Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\nWe have previously been out of compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements due to our failure to maintain a minimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share\nfor our common stock, which failure was remedied in March 2024.\nAlso, on October 11, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the shareholder approval\nrequirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), which require prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving the issuance of 20% or\nmore of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the applicable Minimum Price (as defined in Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)), which non-compliance we remedied in\nDecember 2023.\nAdditionally, on November 15, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum\nstockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Equity Rule”) requires companies listed on the\nNasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000. In the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany reported a stockholders’ deficit of ($149,327), which is below the minimum stockholders’ equity required for continued listing pursuant to the Equity Rule.\nAdditionally, the Company does not meet the alternative Nasdaq continued listing standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules and did not meet the minimum stockholders’ equity\nrequirement as of December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024 or June 30, 2024.\n69\nNasdaq provided the Company until January 2, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance. We submitted the plan to regain compliance in a timely manner,\nand on January 11, 2024, Nasdaq advised the Company that it has determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with the Equity Rule.\nThe terms of the extension were as follows: on or before May 13, 2024, the Company must have completed certain transactions described in greater detail in the\ncompliance plan, contemplated to result in the Company increasing its stockholders’ equity to more than $2.5 million, and opt for one of the two following alternatives to\nevidence compliance with the Equity Rule: Alternative 1: The Company must have furnished to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available report (e.g., a Form 8-K) including: 1.\nA disclosure of the Staff’s deficiency letter and the specific deficiency(ies) cited; 2. A description of the completed transaction or event that enabled the Company to satisfy the\nstockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing; and 3. An affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, the Company believed it had regained compliance with\nthe stockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transaction or event referenced in Step 2; or Alternative 2: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a\npublicly available report including: 1. Steps 1 & 2 set forth above; 2. A balance sheet no older than 60 days with pro forma adjustments for any significant transactions or event\noccurring on or before the report date; and 3. That the Company believes it satisfies the stockholders’ equity requirement as of the report date. The pro forma balance sheet must\nhave evidenced compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement.\nAdditionally, in either case the Company was required to disclose that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company’s ongoing compliance with the stockholders’\nequity requirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting.\nWhile the Company was able to undertake some of the transactions described in the compliance plan, it was unable to regain compliance with the Equity Rule prior to\nthe end of the plan period (May 13, 2024). As a result, on May 14, 2024, the Company received a delist determination letter from the Listing Qualifications department of The\nNasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “Staff”) advising the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company did not meet the terms of the extension. Specifically, the\nCompany did not complete its proposed transactions and was unable to file a Current Report Form 8-K by the May 13, 2024 deadline previously required by the Staff,\nevidencing compliance with the Equity Rule. On May 17, 2024, the Company requested an appeal of the Staff’s delisting determination, and on May 20, 2024, the Staff advised\nthe Company that the delisting action referenced in the Staff’s determination letter had been stayed, pending a final written decision by the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (“Panel”).\nOn July 2, 2024, the Company received notice that the Panel had determined to grant the Company’s request to continue its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market, subject to the\nCompany meeting certain conditions, including filing on or before July 31, 2024, a public disclosure describing the transactions undertaken by the Company to achieve\ncompliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing rules and demonstrate long-term compliance with the Equity Rule and providing an indication of its equity following those\ntransactions. On July 22, 2024, the Panel granted the Company’s request for additional time to achieve compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing rules and demonstrate long-\nterm compliance with the Equity Rule. Specifically, the Hearings Panel subsequently extended that deadline to September 30, 2024, and further to October 15, 2024, to regain\ncompliance with the Equity Rule and to allow the continued listing of the Company’s common stock and warrants on The Nasdaq Stock Market through such date, subject to\nthe Company’s compliance with the Equity Rule on or prior to such date.\nAs a result of the acquisition of the Purchased Assets (discussed below), issuance of the 1,000,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Purchase\nWarrants as described below, on October 4, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq confirming that we had regained compliance with the Equity Rule. Nasdaq also advised the\nCompany that in application of Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(B), the Company will be subject to a mandatory panel monitor for a period of one year from the date of such letter. If,\nwithin that one-year monitoring period, the Staff finds that the Company is no longer in compliance with the Equity Rule, then, notwithstanding Rule 5810(c)(2), the Company\nwill not be permitted to provide Staff with a plan of compliance with respect to such deficiency and the Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for the Company to\nregain compliance with respect to such deficiency, nor will the Company be afforded an applicable cure or compliance period pursuant to Rule 5810(c)(3). Instead, the Staff\nwill issue a Delist Determination Letter and the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the\ninitial Panel is unavailable. The Company will have the opportunity to respond/present to the Hearings Panel as provided by Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(C) and the Company’s\nsecurities may at that time be delisted from Nasdaq.\n70\nIf the Company’s common stock and public warrants are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell the Company’s common stock and public warrants or to\nobtain accurate quotations, and the price of the Company’s common stock and public warrants could suffer a material decline. Delisting could also impair the Company’s ability\nto raise capital and/or trigger defaults and penalties under outstanding agreements or securities of the Company.\nSeparately, on May 14, 2024, the Staff provided us notice of our non-compliance with the audit committee requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq set forth in\nListing Rule 5605(c)(2), which requires that listed companies maintain an audit committee of at least three independent directors. Nasdaq provided the Company a cure period\nin order to regain compliance as follows: until the earlier of the Company’s next annual shareholders’ meeting or May 7, 2025; or if the next annual shareholders’ meeting is\nheld before November 4, 2024, then the Company must evidence compliance no later than November 4, 2024. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by the\napplicable date above, Nasdaq rules require the Staff to provide written notification to the Company that its securities will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal\nthe delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. The Company is currently seeking out qualified independent directors to serve on the Company’s audit committee and expects\nto regain compliance with Listing Rule 5605(c)(2) in the near future.\nAmong the conditions required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq requires us to maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity or\n$500,000 in net income over the prior two years or two of the prior three years. As of September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2024, our\nstockholders’ equity was below $2.5 million and we did not otherwise meet the net income requirements described above, and as such, we were not in compliance with\nNasdaq’s continued listing standards relating to minimum stockholders’ equity until September 30, 2024.\nOur failure to meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements for the reasons above, or any other reason, may result in our securities being delisted from Nasdaq.\nAdditional conditions required for continued listing on Nasdaq include requiring that we have a majority of independent directors, a two-person compensation\ncommittee and a three-member audit committee (each consisting of all independent directors), which three-person audit committee requirement we do not currently meet. As a\nresult, our common stock and Public Warrants may be delisted from Nasdaq.\nEven if we demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq, we will have to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing requirements to continue\nto be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading our common stock and Public Warrants more difficult for investors,\npotentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or\npurchase of our common stock and Public Warrants, the sale or purchase of our common stock and Public Warrants would likely be made more difficult, and the trading volume\nand liquidity of our common stock and Public Warrants could decline. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it\nmore difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by\nother parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could\nseverely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and Public Warrants and the ability of our stockholders and warrant holders to sell our common stock and Public\nWarrants in the secondary market. If our common stock and Public Warrants are delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock and Public Warrants may be eligible to trade on an\nover-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB Market or the OTC Pink market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our common stock and Public\nWarrants or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock and Public Warrants. In the event our common stock and Public Warrants are delisted from\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on an over-the counter quotation system.\n71\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common\nstock.\nWherever possible, our Board will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will\nconsist of restricted shares of our common stock or where shares are to be issued to our officers, directors and applicable consultants. Our Board of Directors has authority,\nwithout action or vote of the stockholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in\nthe issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain\nexceptions), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock,\npossibly at a discount to market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, which may further dilute common stock book value,\nand that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be\nissued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nOur Series B Convertible Preferred Stock includes a liquidation preference.\nOur Series B Convertible Preferred Stock includes a liquidation preference of $17.30 per share or $17,300,000 in aggregate, which is payable upon liquidation, before\nany distribution to our common stock shareholders. As a result, if we were to dissolve, liquidate or wind up our operations, the holders of our Series B Convertible Preferred\nStock would have the right to receive up to the first $17,300,000 in proceeds from any such transaction, and we do not currently have $17.3 million in total net assets. The\npayment of the liquidation preferences could result in common stock shareholders not receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either\nvoluntarily or involuntarily. Additionally, the existence of the liquidation preferences may reduce the value of our common stock, make it harder for us to sell shares of common\nstock in offerings, or prevent or delay a change of control. Because our Board of Directors is entitled to designate the powers and preferences of the preferred stock without a\nvote of our shareholders, subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations, our shareholders will have no control over what designations and preferences our future preferred stock, if\nany, will have.\nThe Series B Convertible Preferred Stock includes anti-dilution protection through the date of Stockholder Approval.\nThe conversion rate of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, currently 0.685 per share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or 685,000 shares of common stock\nin aggregate, which totals 40% of the Company’s post-issuance common stock, is adjustable through the date of Stockholder Approval, and is fixed at the time of Stockholder\nApproval, such that on the Stockholder Approval Date the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be convertible into 40% of the Company’s post-issuance outstanding\ncommon stock. As a result, the total shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will cause significant dilution to existing\nstockholders. Additionally, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be issued an increased number of shares of common stock of the Company if the\noutstanding shares of common stock of the Company increase prior to Stockholder Approval. As a result, if the Company issues any equity compensation, sells any shares in\nany other offerings, or otherwise issues any shares of common stock prior to the Stockholder Approval Date, the holder(s) of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will\nreceive additional shares of common stock (compared to the number of shares of common stock due as of the date of this Report), so that they will retain their 40% post-\nissuance ownership of the Company as of the Stockholder Approval Date. Such additional issuances will in turn cause significant dilution to the stockholders of the Company.\nNotwithstanding the above, the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is 10 million shares of\ncommon stock, the total percentage of outstanding common stock which the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will be convertible into will be fixed at 40% at the time of\nStockholder Approval, and no conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock can occur prior to Stockholder Approval.\n72\nThe issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and upon exercise of warrants will cause immediate and substantial\ndilution to existing shareholders.\nFollowing Stockholder Approval, each holder of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may, at its option, convert its shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock\ninto a number of shares of common stock as equals 40% of the Company’s post-issuance common stock at the time of Stockholder Approval, divided by the 1,000,000\noutstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will result in\nimmediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nThe availability of shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares,\ncould adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock upon the conversion of our Series B\nConvertible Preferred Stock and/or upon exercise of outstanding warrants, or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the\nmarket price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock upon the conversion of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and\nupon exercise of warrants, or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon the conversion of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and upon exercise of warrants may represent overhang that\nmay also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company’s stock in the market than there is demand for\nthat stock. When this happens the price of our stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share\nprice. If the share volume of our common stock cannot absorb shares sold by holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants, then the value of our common\nstock will likely decrease.\nAdditionally, the warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock which we granted effective September 30, 2024, which have an exercise price of $1.68 per\nshare and a term of seven years, which aren’t exercisable until or unless Stockholder Approval is received, have cashless exercise rights, which means that such warrants can be\nexercised without paying us any cash and instead with the holder netting the value of the exercise price against the value of the shares issuable upon exercise thereof.\nAdditionally, any shares of common stock issuable upon the cashless exercise of such warrants will likely be able to tack the holding period of such shares of common stock\nwith the warrants.\nThe influx of any of these shares into the public market could potentially have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe Series B Convertible Preferred Stock includes certain protective provisions and after Stockholder Approval, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will vote\n40% of our then common stock.\nUntil such time, if ever, as Stockholder Approval is received, the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock only has rights to vote on amendments to the Series B\nDesignation (which are subject to the approval of a simple majority of the holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock), and the Protective Provisions, discussed below.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock requires the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to\n(a) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company; (b) adopt or\nauthorize any new designation of any Preferred Stock or amend the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company in a manner which (i) provides any holder of common stock or\npreferred stock any rights upon a liquidation of the Company which are prior and superior to those of the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; or (ii) adversely\naffect the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (c) effect an exchange, or create a right of exchange, cancel, or create a right to cancel,\nof all or any part of the shares of another class of shares into shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (d) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of the\nshares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock so as to affect adversely the shares of such series; and (e) issue any shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Convertible\nPreferred Stock (collectively, the “Protective Provisions”).\n73\nAfter Stockholder Approval, in addition to the above voting rights, each holder of outstanding shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast\nthe number of votes in connection with the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shares held by such holder equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which\nthe shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. At the\ntime of Stockholder Approval such voting rights will total 40% of the total vote of the common stock, subject to a maximum of 10 million shares of common stock being\nissuable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and will thereafter decrease if additional shares of common stock of the Company are issued. Except as\nprovided by law or by the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or the Series B Designation, holders of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall vote together\nwith the holders of common stock as a single class and there shall be no series voting.\nAs a result, following Stockholder Approval, the holders of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock will have significant influence on the stockholder vote.\nConsequently, they will have the ability to influence matters affecting our stockholders and therefore exercise significant control in determining the outcome of a number of\ncorporate transactions or other matters, including (i) making amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation; (ii) election of directors; and (iii) any merger or significant\ncorporate transactions. As a potential investor in the Company, you should keep in mind that even if you own shares of our common stock and wish to vote them at annual or\nspecial shareholder meetings, your shares will have little effect on the outcome of corporate decisions immediately following Stockholder Approval. The interests of the holders\nof the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders.\nIn addition, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our common stock by: (1) delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control\nof our Company; (2) impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our Company; or (3) discouraging a potential acquirer from making a\ntender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThere have been no sales of unregistered securities during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and for the period from July 1, 2024, to the filing date of this report\nwhich have not previously been reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K.\n* * * * *\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone.\nItem 3.

In the case of some drug candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the drug candidate may be inherently\ntoo toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.\n“Phase 2” trials are generally when clinical trials are initiated in a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to\npreliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase 2 trials are sometimes\nfurther divided into: Phase 2a and Phase 2b trials — Phase 2a is focused specifically on dosing requirements. A small number of patients are administered the drug in different\nquantities to evaluate whether there is a dose-response relationship, which is an increase in response that correlates with increasing increments of dose. In addition, the optimal\nfrequency of dose is also explored; and Phase 2b trials are designed specifically to rigorously test the efficacy of the drug in terms of how successful it is in treating, preventing\nor diagnosing a disease.\niv\n“Phase 3” trials are when clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically\ndispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for regulatory\napproval and product labeling.\n“Phase 4” trials are studies required to be conducted as a condition of approval in order to gather additional information on the drug’s effect in various populations and\nany side effects associated with long-term use.\n“PHS Act” means the Public Health Service Act, a set of U.S. laws passed by Congress in 1944 which, among other things, provide statutory authority for the FDA to\nregulate biological products.\n“Physiotherapy” is treatment to restore, maintain, and make the most of a patient’s mobility, function, and well-being.\n“POCD” means post-operative cognitive dysfunction/delirium.\n“RA” means rheumatoid arthritis.\n“REMS” means a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy which is a drug safety program that the FDA can require for certain medications with serious safety concerns\nto help ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks.\n“SCA” means Synthetic Cannabidiol Analogs, which are synthetic pharmaceutical grade molecules close or distant analogs of non-psychoactive cannabinoids such as\nCBD for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain.\n“Section 505(b)(2) NDA” or “section 505(b)(2) application” means a New Drug Application submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the FDC Act, which is a regulatory\nvehicle in the United States through which drug sponsors formally propose that the FDA approve a pharmaceutical for sale and marketing, that allows the applicant to rely on\nprevious investigations conducted by others and for which the sponsor does not have a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were\nconducted.\n“Sponsor” means the applicant or drug sponsor, which is the person or entity who assumes responsibility for the marketing of a new drug, including responsibility for\ncompliance with applicable provisions of the FSC Act and related regulations.

No\nchange was made to the trading symbol for the Company’s shares of common stock or public warrants, “ATNF” and “ATNFW”, respectively, in connection with the Reverse\nStock Split.\nThe Certificate of Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized shares of our common stock, nor alter the par value of our common stock or modify any voting\nrights or other terms of our common stock.\nNo fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split and stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares,\nwere instead entitled to have their fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share.\nFebruary 2024 Reverse Stock Split\nOn February 16, 2024, at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders of the Company, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, by a ratio of\nbetween one-for-four to one-for-forty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be determined by our Board of Directors.\nOn February 26, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a one-for-19 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding common stock and the filing of a\nCertificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to affect such reverse stock split, which was filed on February 26, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split became effective\non February 28, 2024 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time, with shares beginning trading on a split-adjusted basis at market open on February 28, 2024. In connection with the Reverse\nStock Split, every 19 shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time were automatically converted into one share of the Company’s\ncommon stock.\nIn connection with the reverse split, all outstanding options, warrants, and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of common\nstock were adjusted, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under the Company’s equity incentive plans were also\nappropriately adjusted. Following the reverse split, the par value of the Common Stock remained unchanged at $0.0001 par value per share. The reverse split did not change the\nauthorized number of shares of common stock or preferred stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse split, and stockholders who would otherwise\nbe entitled to receive a fractional share instead received one whole share of common stock in lieu of such fractional share.\nThe effects of the 1-for-19 Reverse Stock Split have been retroactively reflected throughout this Report.\nDefinition\nUnless the context requires otherwise, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “180 Life”, “180LS” and “180 Life Sciences Corp.” refer specifically to 180\nLife Sciences Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

We were founded by several world-leading scientists in the\nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. Our world-renowned scientists Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann, Prof. Lawrence Steinman, Prof. Raphael Mechoulam, since deceased, Dr.\nJonathan Rothbard, and Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal have significant experience and significant previous success in drug discovery. The scientists are from the University of\nOxford (“Oxford”), Stanford University and Hebrew University of Jerusalem (the “Hebrew University”), and our management team has extensive experience in financing and\ngrowing early-stage healthcare companies. Prof. Raphael Mechoulam passed away in March 2023, but his research at Hebrew University is being carried on by other scientists\nas noted later in this document under the “SCAs Platform” section.\nWe have three different product development platforms that are focused on different diseases or medical conditions, and that target different factors, molecules or\nproteins, as follows:\n● Anti-TNF platform: focusing on fibrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor (“anti-TNF”);\n● SCAs platform: focusing on drugs which are synthetic cannabidiol (“CBD”) or cannabigerol (“CBG”) analogues (“SCAs”); and\n● α7nAChR platform: focusing on alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (“α7nAChR”).\nOur lead product candidate under the anti-TNF platform completed Phase 2a and Phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trials in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and the\nNetherlands for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture, a condition that affects the development of fibrous connective tissue in the palm of the hand.\nCurrently, we are planning or conducting clinical trials only for certain indications under the anti-TNF platform, such as a planned Phase 2 trial for post-operative\ncognitive decline as well as a planned Phase 2 trial for frozen shoulder. We previously recruited patients for a feasibility trial for frozen shoulder, for which we have ended such\nrecruitment at nine patients, due to a regulatory request in the U.K. to end slow recruiting trials. The result of the closure of the trial means that another trial will likely need to\nbe undertaken in the future to recruit additional participants.\nWe were recently granted an allowance of claims for a U.S. patent with respect to the use of adalimumab for early-stage Dupuytren’s disease which, if granted, would\nhave a term that expires no earlier than in 2037. Of our three product development platforms, only one, the SCAs platform, involves products that are related to cannabidiol\n(CBD) (and not to cannabis or tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)), and no clinical trials for indications or products under the SCAs platform are currently being conducted in the\nUnited States or abroad. We are currently undertaking preclinical research and development activities for the SCA platform. Due to restrictions in the Company’s resources, the\nCompany has not made progress in the α7nAChR platform and has suspended further research and development activity in the meantime.\nThe Company is currently evaluating all options to monetize its existing assets, in addition to exploring other strategic alternatives to maximize value for its\nshareholders. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include, but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger,\nreverse merger, other business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic transactions involving the Company.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur goal is to capitalize on our research in chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis by pursuing the following strategies:\n● advance our clinical-stage product candidate for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture from its current late-stage development to seek and obtain approval in the\nU.K., European Union (“EU”) and the United States (“U.S.”) for such product candidate, potentially commercialize the product candidate in the U.K., EU and\nU.S. and identify the optimal commercial pathway in other markets around the world;\n● move our pre-clinical product candidates into clinical trials, seek and obtain approval in the U.K., EU and U.S. for such future product candidates, and potentially\ncommercialize such future product candidates in the U.S., U.K. and EU;\n● leverage our proprietary product development platforms to discover, develop and commercialize novel first-in-class products for the treatment of chronic pain,\ninflammation and fibrosis; and\n● strengthen our position in research in chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis.\n3\nOverview of Product Development Platforms\nThe following chart summarizes the products and indications, including those currently in clinical trial, for our three product development platforms.\n* Regulatory approvals obtained from the MHRA and CCMO and the relevant accredited ethics committees to perform clinical trials in the U.K. and The Netherlands. No\nmarketing applications or requests for marketing approval have been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any products at this time.\nOn December 1, 2021, we announced positive top line data for the Phase 2b clinical trial of Dupuytren’s Contracture.\nOn February 22, 2023, we announced the closure of recruitment of patients for the feasibility trial for frozen shoulder, for which we have ended such recruitment at\nnine patients, due to a regulatory request in the U.K. to end slow recruiting trials. The result of the closure of the trial means that another trial will likely need to be undertaken\nin the future to recruit additional participants.\nThe product development platforms are each described in more detail below.\nFibrosis & Anti-TNF Platform\nOur anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) platform began at our wholly-owned subsidiary, 180 Therapeutics L.P. (“180 LP”). This platform is focused on studying the\nmolecular mechanism of inflammatory diseases and fibrosis and on the discovery of TNF as a mediator of fibrosis, as well as other immune-driven diseases. This research was\nfirst undertaken in the 1980s by our Executive Co-Chairman, Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann, based on analysis of tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). We are\napplying this same approach to the analysis of human disease tissue from patients with active fibrosis, research led by Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal in Oxford (who is also the\nChairman of our Clinical Advisory Board), which has led to the identification of new therapeutic targets and approaches that we are developing. Profs. Nanchahal and\nFeldmann, in collaboration with other scientists, are leveraging their experience and expertise in developing anti-inflammatories to search for new applications for anti-TNF\ntherapeutics. We are seeking to demonstrate that anti-TNF drugs, such as adalimumab, have a positive effect on new indications such as Dupuytren’s Contracture, frozen\nshoulder and post-operative cognitive dysfunction/delirium (“POCD”).\n4\nOur first product candidate in clinical development is for the potential treatment of early-stage fibrosis of the hand, Dupuytren’s Contracture, for which there is\ncurrently no approved treatment in the U.K. or EU. Collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum has been approved in the USA for late-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture. The\nproposed treatment will be administered by a local injection of adalimumab, an anti-TNF antibody, into early-stage disease tissue. The results for the Phase 2a clinical trial for\nDupuytren’s Contracture, supported by the Wellcome Trust, U.K. Department of Health and us, were published in July 2018. The study demonstrated positive tissue response\nindicative of anti-fibrotic mechanisms, as well as guiding dosing for follow up trials. Having defined the most efficacious dose and preparation and based on these positive\nproof of concept data, we, together with the Wellcome Trust and the U.K. Department of Health, initiated a Phase 2b trial in patients with early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture.\nThe initial plan was to randomize 138 patients in a ratio of 1:1 to receive four injections of adalimumab or placebo at three-month intervals and followed for a total of 18\nmonths from baseline. With additional funding from the Wellcome Trust, the Phase 2b trial completed recruitment of 174 patients in April 2019, having commenced dosing in\nFebruary 2017. The final patient was enrolled in April 2019. The Phase 2b clinical trial for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture has been completed. On December 1, 2021, we\nannounced top line data from the trial, which indicates that the primary end point of nodule hardness and the secondary end point of nodule size on ultrasound scan were met\nwith statistically significant differences. There were no related severe adverse events. As previously reported, the full results of the trial have been published in a peer-reviewed\njournal. Through this fibrosis and anti-TNF product development platform, we are also performing research for the development of potential treatments of frozen shoulder, liver\nand lung fibrosis and POCD.\nWe have obtained regulatory approvals from the U.K. MHRA and the Dutch Centrale Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek (CCMO), as well as from the relevant\naccredited ethics committees, in order to perform clinical trials in the U.K. and The Netherlands solely for indications under the anti-TNF platform. No marketing applications\nor requests for marketing approval have been submitted to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any indications or products under the anti-TNF platform at this\ntime. On March 29, 2022, we submitted a request to the FDA for a Type C Meeting to discuss clinical outcome assessment in clinical trials of the anti-TNF platform for early\nstage Dupuytren’s disease. On April 26, 2022, the FDA granted the meeting request and agreed to provide written responses in lieu of a meeting. On June 9, 2022, the FDA\nprovided the aforementioned written responses in which the agency questioned whether nodule hardness and size would constitute an appropriate end point in such studies.\nSpecifically, the FDA stated, “The proposed outcome measures of nodule hardness and nodule size do not appear to be clinical outcome measures that measure how a patient\nfeels, functions, or survives, which would be needed to support a demonstration of efficacy in your future registrational studies.”\nFollowing the Phase 2b trial, discussed previously, which demonstrated the efficacy of anti-TNF injections in reducing or eliminating the size and hardness of the\npalmar nodules, which we believe may help in the prevention of the finger disability and the eventual need for surgery, our intention remains to seek Conditional Marketing\nAuthorization (“CMA”) for the therapy in the U.K. This authorization requires approval from the U.K. MHRA. Subsequently, we plan to begin the necessary procedures to seek\napproval in the U.S., EU, and other potential countries.\nTo support our CMA application, we have had two scientific advice meetings with the MHRA. During these meetings, the MHRA requested additional information\nregarding the reduction in nodule size and hardness and its impact on the eventual need for surgery of the deformed fingers. While we presented data on a limited number of\npatients, demonstrating that those treated with anti-TNF injections did not require early surgery compared to the placebo group, the sample size was too small to draw definitive\nconclusions. Nonetheless, based on the strength of the available data, we believe, and our regulatory consultants in the U.K. and U.S. believe, it is appropriate to pursue a CMA\nfor the U.K. market in conjunction with the initiation of a limited size Phase 3 outcomes trial. This trial has to be initiated prior to the submission of the CMA approval request\ndocuments. Our clinical consultants have designed a trial that we believe can be completed within three years, that is expected to meet the requirements set forth by the\nregulatory authorities and allow for consideration of CMA. We have submitted a request for a follow-up scientific advice meeting with the MHRA to discuss this trial strategy.\nDue to the agency’s high workload and limited staff, we have not yet received a confirmed date for this meeting.\nConsidering our plans for seeking marketing approval in the United States and other countries, we are also seeking a meeting with the U.S. FDA. This meeting, known\nas a Type C meeting, aims to explore the potential for a pathway towards a pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) application and an International IND application meeting. We\nbelieve that conducting the follow-on Phase 3 trial, discussed above, will likewise be necessary for FDA acceptance. We have submitted a request to the FDA for this meeting\nbut have not yet received a confirmed date.\nAs we pursue this regulatory strategy, we will need to raise additional financing.\nOn February 22, 2023, we announced the closure of recruitment of patients for the feasibility trial for frozen shoulder, for which we have ended such recruitment at\nnine patients, due to a regulatory request in the U.K. to end slow recruiting trials. The result of the closure of the trial means that another trial will likely need to be undertaken\nin the future to recruit additional participants.\n5\nHMGB1 Program\nOur HMGB1 program was formed with the in-licensing of the technology from the University of Oxford on November 2, 2021. Our HMGB1 program fell under the\nFibrosis and Anti-TNF Platform. We identified HMGB1 as a therapeutic target that acts on multiple endogenous adult stem cells to accelerate the physiological regenerative\nresponse to current or future injuries. These findings have broad relevance to the fields of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine and suggest a therapeutic approach to\npromote tissue repair such as in NASH liver regeneration.\nDue to the ongoing costs of this research program and the need for the Company to focus its resources on the Company’s primary platform to treat fibrosis using anti-\nTNF (tumor necrosis factor), the Board of Directors of the Company elected to terminate the Company’s HMGB1 license agreement with Oxford on September 22, 2023, and\non September 22, 2023, the Company and Oxford entered into a termination letter, formally terminating the License effective September 22, 2023. The termination letter also\nclarified amounts that we owed after termination of the License, including approximately $20,000 in unbilled fees, which were paid in December 2023. No material early\ntermination penalties were incurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the license.\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company entered into a research sponsorship agreement related to the HMGB1 program, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sponsor\nongoing research at Oxford related to the HMGB1 program. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company entered into an obligation to pay, in aggregate, £500,000 in 2023. The\nCompany has not made any payments towards this program to date and is in negotiations with Oxford to reduce this amount owed.\nSCAs Platform\nOur SCAs platform began at our wholly-owned subsidiary, CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“CBR Pharma”) with the collaborative work of its founders Prof.\nMechoulam, deceased, and Prof. Feldmann. This platform focuses on the development of synthetic pharmaceutical grade molecules close or distant analogs of non-\npsychoactive cannabinoids such as CBD for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and pain. These development efforts are a result of a 20-year collaboration between Prof.\nFeldmann, who discovered and commercialized anti-TNF therapy for treatment of RA and subsequently a number of inflammatory diseases, which is currently the best-selling\ndrug class in the world, and Prof. Mechoulam, who was a world leading expert in cannabis chemistry who successfully identified THC, CBD and, subsequently, the\nendocannabinoids. We are working with a research team based at the Kennedy Institute at Oxford, consisting of Prof. Feldmann, Prof. Richard Williams and others, and a\nresearch team based at Hebrew University, consisting of Prof. Avi Domb, Prof. Amnon Hoffman and others, to generate new drugs, test them, and optimize their uptake and\ndelivery to disease targets. The aim is to develop novel, orally active analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications based on synthetic compounds to target chronic diseases. We\nterm these synthetic compounds generically as “synthetic CBD analogs” (“SCAs”). Our primary development targets are arthritis and chronic and recurrent pain, while our\nsecondary development targets are diabetes/diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, obesity and fatty liver disease. Unfortunately, Dr. Mechoulam passed away in\nMarch 2023, and while he will be sorely missed, work with his colleagues will continue as necessary.\nNo regulatory approvals have been sought or obtained from appropriate authorities at this time for any products or indications under the SCAs platform.\nα7nAChR Platform\nOur α7nAChR platform began at our wholly-owned subsidiary, Katexco, where its founders identified α7nAChR as a key receptor for the amyloid proteins associated\nwith diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. α7nAChR is expressed on the surface of both neuronal cells in the brain and on important cells of the immune system.\nThe research conducted by Dr. Jonathan Rothbard and Prof. Steinman has shown that small molecules available as drugs taken by mouth can engage this receptor and\npotentially reduce inflammatory diseases. Dr. Rothbard and Prof. Steinman have also shown that α7nAChR is critical in reducing disease animal models of multiple sclerosis\nand RA, as well as heart attack and stroke. Our α7nAChR product development platform is currently focused on developing α7nAChR agonists for the treatment of\ninflammatory diseases, initially ulcerative colitis induced after cessation of smoking.\n6\nNo regulatory approvals have been sought or obtained from appropriate authorities at this time for any products or indications under the α7nAChR platform. Until we\nare able to obtain sufficient capital to pursue this program, we do not expect to make significant progress with our α7nAChR platform.\nProduct Candidates\nWe are attempting to build a broad and diverse pipeline of product candidates in chronic pain, inflammation and fibrosis. Our product candidates are and will be\nselected for development based on: potential to address unmet medical needs; development feasibility as determined by our preclinical research and development efforts;\npotential to rapidly achieve proof-of-concept based on easy-to-measure validated regulatory endpoints; and significant commercial potential.\nAnti-TNF Platform Dupuytren’s Contracture\nOverview\nDupuytren’s Contracture, also referred to as hand fibrosis, is a progressive, incurable disease characterized by the development of fibrous cords in the palm of the\nhand, commonly affecting the ring and/or small finger and often multiple joints, leading to contracture and the inability to straighten the affected fingers. Symptoms, when\npresented to a physician, range from the appearance of nodules in the palm, which can be painless or painful and often disconcerting to the patient, to the loss of the use of the\ncontracted finger. There are currently no approved treatment options for those patients who present with symptomatic, early-stage disease.\nSurgery remains the standard treatment for patients with Dupuytren’s Contractures but is associated with extended recovery periods and risks of recurrence.\nWe are developing therapies by repurposing of the anti-TNF therapeutic adalimumab, previously approved and used under the brand name Humira for several\nautoimmune conditions, for the treatment of early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture. Research at Oxford University has indicated an anti-TNF mechanism can slow or prevent the\nproliferation of myoblast cells that lead to the formation and growth of the fibrous nodules/cords in the palm and possible finger contracture. We have advanced the\ndevelopment program through Phase 2b clinical trials to evaluate the impact of multiple, intralesional injections on disease progression and functional improvement.\nDupuytren’s patients who have advanced disease are primarily treated by orthopedic or plastic surgeons, who rely on invasive interventions when the contracture\nimpacts hand function. Current treatment options include open surgeries (fasciotomies or fasciectomies) and the less invasive procedures of needle aponeurotomy (NA) or\ncollagenase injections. The less invasive procedures are designed to disrupt the integrity of a contracted cord so the fingers can be straightened. Unfortunately, these options are\nassociated with a high rate of recurrence. Dissatisfaction within the medical and Dupuytren patient community with outcomes for later-stage disease and the lack of options to\nintervene at an early/pre-contracture stage indicate there is an unmet medical need for early-stage intervention.\nAccording to the Dupuytren’s Foundation, Dupuytren’s Contracture prevalence is estimated to be up to 7% of the U.S. population. Based on the Foundation’s\nestimates, approximately three million patients have contractures that should be treated but only 10% to 20% of those patients are treated. Reasons for the lack of treatment may\ninclude the type of available interventions, poor long-term outcomes, and reimbursement hurdles.\nIn primary interviews in late 2021 with 8 orthopedic/plastic surgeons, conducted by Red Sky Partners (an independent third-party consulting firm) on our behalf and\ndesigned to better understand the unmet need for patients with Dupuytren’s Contracture, revealed a strong desire among hand surgeons and patients to treat this condition early,\nbefore the development of late stage contractures, in a non-invasive manner that will limit further progression, preserve function and prevent or delay invasive surgery.\nSurgeons’ reactions to the rationale for the use of adalimumab to address this unmet need were overall positive and the mechanistic concept of an anti-TNF compound was\nconsidered compelling. In the view of the majority of surveyed hand surgeons, the non-invasive, safe product profile would potentially position adalimumab as an important\ntherapeutic option for a much wider range of patients than are typically treated today. Assuming clinical efficacy and safety are supported with published data, we believe that\nadalimumab would become an attractive alternative to surgery, needle aponeurotomy or collagenase. Further, we believe it has potential use in many early-stage patients who\nare not treated today.\n7\nBased on both primary (feedback from these physician interviews) and secondary research, Red Sky Partners concluded that an initial label focused on patients with a\nclear contracture where adalimumab would soften nodules and limit progression would be highly differentiated from current therapies and could generate revenues in the range\nof $300 million to $350 million annually in the U.S. More significantly, the opportunity to offer a safe, non-invasive therapeutic leading to improved function could\ndramatically expand the treatable population as more patients seek treatment and more physicians are motivated to offer their patients an alternative to waiting to see if their\ndisease progresses, which they cannot do today.\nPhase 2 Clinical Trials\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, 180 LP, contributed to the funding of a Phase 2a clinical trial for Dupuytren’s Contracture along with the Wellcome Trust and the U.K.\nDepartment of Health, which using an experimental medicine clinical trial design demonstrated positive tissue response, as well as guiding dosing and tolerability for follow-up\ntrials. The data was published in June 2018.\nFor the Phase 2a trial, we recruited 28 patients, eight assigned to the 15 milligrams (mg), 12 to the 35 mg and eight to the 40 mg adalimumab cohorts. There was no\nchange in mRNA levels for ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1 and CDH11. Levels of α-SMA protein expression in patients treated with 40 mg adalimumab (1.09 ± 0.09 ng per μg of\ntotal protein) were significantly lower (p = 0.006) compared to placebo treated patients (1.51 ± 0.09 ng/μg). The levels of procollagen type I protein expression were also\nsignificantly lower (p = 0.019) in the subgroup treated with 40 mg adalimumab (474 ± 84 pg/μg total protein) compared with placebo (817 ± 78 pg/μg). There were two serious\nadverse events, both considered unrelated to the study drug. In this dose-ranging study, injection of 40 mg of adalimumab in 0.4 ml resulted in down regulation of the\nmyofibroblast phenotype as evidenced by reduction in expression of α-SMA and type I procollagen proteins at 2 weeks.\nHaving defined the most efficacious dose and preparation and based on these positive proof-of-concept data, we, together with the Wellcome Trust and the U.K.\nDepartment of Health, initiated a Phase 2b trial in patients with early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture. The initial plan was to randomize 138 patients in a ratio of 1:1 to receive\nfour injections of adalimumab or placebo at three-month intervals and followed for a total of 18 months from baseline. The Phase 2b trial, which was funded by grants from the\nWellcome Trust and the U.K. Department of Health, with a contribution from 180 LP to purchase the drug, completed recruitment of 174 patients in April 2019 and commenced\ndosing in February 2017 in the U.K. and Groningen, The Netherlands.\nThe Phase 2b clinical trial for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture has been completed. On December 1, 2021, we announced top line data from the trial, which\nindicates that the primary end point of nodule hardness and the secondary end point of nodule size on ultrasound scan were met with statistically significant differences. There\nwere no related severe adverse events. The full results have been published in the Lancet Rheumatology publication on April 29, 2022. Based on the results of the Phase 2b\nclinical trial, the study’s researchers analyzed data on costs and quality of life, which is required for U.K. NICE marketing approval. They extrapolated the trial results using a\npatient-level simulation model, which estimated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of adalimumab for treatment of Dupuytren’s Disease. The simulated model also evaluated\nwhether hypothetical repeated courses of adalimumab each time the nodule reactivated (every three years) in patients are likely to be cost-effective for treating progressive\nearly-stage Dupuytren’s Disease. The model-based extrapolation showed that, over a lifetime, repeated courses of adalimumab are likely to cost £14,593 per quality-adjusted\nlife year gained, which would be considered highly cost-effective compared with the current standard National Health Service (NHS) practice.\nOther Product Candidates or Indications\nIn addition to the potential treatment, we are developing for Dupuytren’s Contracture described above, we are seeking to repurpose anti-TNF for use as a treatment for\nother fibrotic conditions such as frozen shoulder. Prof. Feldmann’s previous work in the 1980’s demonstrated that anti-TNF is an effective anti-inflammatory with many\npossible uses, and it was subsequently approved for various forms of inflammatory arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as other indications. This has since\ncreated what is currently the best-selling drug class in the world, anti-TNF therapeutics, which, according to a Research Reports World report published on November 3, 2022,\nwas valued at $42.7 billion in 2022. By using a well-known and extensively used therapeutic, adalimumab, the research and development process may be truncated because of\nexisting product information relating to safety, as the drug has been widely used over the past 20 years in millions of patients.\n8\nFrozen Shoulder\nFrozen shoulder, also referred to as adhesive capsulitis, is an extremely painful and debilitating condition that affects an individual’s everyday activities, including\nsleep. According to the National Institute of Health, frozen shoulder is most common in people between the ages of 40 and 60. It is estimated that 2% to 5% of the population\nare affected by frozen shoulder at some point, and it is somewhat more common in women than in men. People with diabetes are particularly likely to develop a frozen\nshoulder: About 10 to 20% of them get it, but it is not yet known why this happens. In addition, approximately 20% of people suffering from a frozen shoulder will develop the\nsame problem in their other shoulder. According to an article published in Shoulder & Elbow in 2010, it is estimated that up to 30% of patients with diabetes develop frozen\nshoulder, and the symptoms tend to be more persistent and recalcitrant in this group. A large percentage of frozen shoulder patients also have Dupuytren’s. Our working\nhypothesis is that frozen shoulder involves a similar TNF-driven fibrotic process as Dupuytren’s and, as a result, might benefit from anti-TNF injections, as seen in our Phase\n2b trial in patients with early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture.\nDuring the pain predominant inflammatory phase, patients are typically treated with analgesics, physiotherapy and corticosteroid injections. Patients with persistent\nstiffness may be referred to secondary care for capsular release by manipulation under anesthesia, hydrodilatation or surgical arthroscopy. To our knowledge, there is currently\nno approved targeted therapy, and in conjunction with the National Institute for Health Research (U.K.), we are investigating the feasibility of recruiting patients during the\nearly pain-predominant inflammatory phase of the disease and delivery of a local injection of anti-TNF. The set-up stage for this Phase 2 clinical trial for the local injection of\nanti-TNF for frozen shoulder started in June 2021. A £250,000 grant has been awarded from NIHR to the University of Oxford to support execution and clinical trial sites are\nbeing identified. We are providing additional funding to support this trial. The recruitment of men and women across England with early-stage Frozen shoulder for a trial to\ndetermine the feasibility of conducting a large randomized controlled trial to assess whether an intra-articular injection of anti-TNF (Adalimumab) can reduce pain and improve\nfunction in people with pain predominant early-stage frozen shoulder, which was called the Anti-Freaze-F trial, began in May 2022. The Anti-Freaze-F trial was being run by\nthe University of Oxford and originally sought to recruit 84 participants. Following delays in gaining approvals due to backlogs in the NIHR system due to COVID-19 and\nconsequential staff vacancies, nine participants were recruited for participation in the trial through mid-February 2023. Subsequently, the NIHR’s Research Recovery and Reset\nprogram identified the trial as slow moving, due to the considerable challenges we faced to open recruitment sites and enroll sufficient participants during COVID-19.\nTherefore, the NIHR asked the chief investigators to close the trial for further recruitment. Our request for a no cost trial extension was denied. The participants enrolled to date\nhave received their injections and follow up according to the established protocol. The result of the closure of the trial means that another trial will likely need to be undertaken\nat a future time to recruit additional participants.\nHuman Liver Fibrosis\nFibrosis of the liver is characterized by long-term damage to the organ caused by the replacement of normal liver tissue with scar tissue. The condition is most\ncommonly caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), which encompasses non-alcoholic fatty liver (“NFL”) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”). NAFLD\naffects approximately 30% of the U.S. population, according to an article published in Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology in 2016. Approximately 2% of patients\nwith NFL and approximately 15% to 20% of patients with NASH progress to cirrhosis, fibrosis of the liver with major health issues.\nTo our knowledge, there is no current approved treatment for individuals with NASH. We therefore believe that there is a large potential market for the creation of an\neffective preventative treatment. According to Allied Market Research, the market for treating liver fibrosis was approximately $13 billion in 2018 and is projected to rise to\napproximately $20 billion in 2022, rising at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 11% per year. We initiated preclinical studies for NASH based on human liver\nsamples during the second quarter of 2020. We have performed preclinical work, but do not plan to move forward in a significant manner without raising additional capital.\n9\nPost-operative Cognitive Decline (POCD)\nPOCD is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome, defined as disturbance of attention, awareness and cognition, which develops over a short period of time and tends to\nfluctuate during the course of the day. Patients with hip fracture are at particularly high risk of developing POCD. The U.K.’s national audit data for 2018 showed that 25% of\nall patients with hip fracture suffered from delirium. POCD is associated with poor functional outcomes, reduced quality of life and longer hospital stays. People with hip\nfracture who developed delirium are twice as likely to die as inpatients, and nearly four times more likely to need placement in a nursing home. POCD has also been closely\nassociated with long-term cognitive impairment.\nHip fractures are one of the main challenges facing elderly patients and healthcare systems. According to an article published in The Lancet Public Health in 2017, hip\nfractures are associated with an average loss of 2.7% of the healthy life expectancy in the middle-aged and older population in the U.S. and Europe. People suffering hip\nfracture have a mean age of 83 years, are frail, and two-thirds are women. They suffer a 30-day mortality of 7% and experience a persistent reduction in their health-related\nquality-of-life similar to that of a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis. According to various studies, POCD is developed in 13-40% of patients following\ncardiac surgery. With 500,000 open heart surgeries and 450,000 hip surgeries in the U.S. each year, in advanced age patients, a beneficial therapy to treat POCD would be a\nsignificant benefit to these patients. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study using anti-TNF for POCD and start patient recruitment during 2024. An issued patent to protect this\npotential use has been licensed from The Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research. Our researchers discovered that tissue damaging surgery releases TNF into the circulation\nwhich, in turn, opens the brain cognitive areas for an influx of inflammatory mediators, resulting in delirium, which might be prevented by administering anti-TNF at the time\nof surgery. Experiments in animal models have supported this hypothesis.\nSCAs Platform\nOverview\nCannabinoids are a class of compounds derived from cannabis plants. The two major cannabinoids contained in cannabis are CBD and THC. Although one\ncannabinoid, THC, is known to cause psychoactive effects associated with the use of herbal cannabis, no other cannabinoid is known to share these properties. In recent\ndecades, there have been major scientific advances that have led to the discovery of new plant-derived cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system. There are at least two\ntypes of cannabinoid receptors in the human endocannabinoid system, cannabinoid receptor 1 (“CB1”) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (“CB2”). CB1 receptors are considered to be\namong the most widely expressed G protein-coupled receptors in the brain and are particularly abundant in areas of the brain concerned with movement and postural control,\npain and sensory perception, memory, cognition, emotion, and autonomic and endocrine function. CB1 receptors are also found in peripheral tissues including peripheral nerves\nand non-neuronal tissues such as muscle, liver tissues and fat. CB2 receptors are expressed primarily in tissues in the immune system and are believed to mediate the\nimmunological effects of cannabinoids. CBD does not interact with CB1 receptors and is only a weak agonist of CB2 receptors. CBD interacts with other important\nneurotransmitter and neuromodulatory systems in the human body, including transient receptor potential channels, adenosine uptake and serotonin receptors. The far-reaching\nand diverse pharmacology of the numerous cannabinoids provides significant potential for development of cannabinoid therapeutics across many indications and disease areas,\nbut also adds to the complexity of the research.\nFor the SCA program, we have agreements in place with Hebrew University and Oxford, pursuant to which we intend to conduct research to develop and characterize\nnovel SCAs for the treatment of certain target indications, and to perform early-phase clinical trials. Through the Research Agreements with Hebrew University and Oxford, we\nestablished research facilities at the Hebrew University and Oxford, in which the development and testing of new cannabinoids designed and synthesized at the Hebrew\nUniversity will be facilitated. The labs at the Hebrew University will synthesize the chemical compounds and perform preliminary efficacy and safety studies.\nOnce these initial studies are completed at the Hebrew University, the chemical compounds are sent to Prof. Richard Williams at Oxford, where further evaluation is\ncarried out to identify candidates which have the best potential for clinical efficacy and commercial development. Subsequently, we will support the clinical development of the\nlead compound(s), culminating in Phase 2 clinical trials to establish clinical utility in chronic pain and inflammatory indications.\n10\nThe focus of the research is the development of safe and well-tolerated compounds with analgesic and immunomodulatory activity and with the capacity to synergize\nwith current therapies, which target downstream inflammatory processes. After conducting initial research and development, we selected the most promising of the chemical\nderivatives to move into Phase 1/2 clinical trials, pending successful toxicity studies. In addition, we have identified two lead solid dosage oral formulations of CBD from\nanimal studies, and preparations are underway to facilitate pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy human volunteers.\nProduct Candidates or Indications\nWe believe that there are unmet needs for orally available, relatively safe anti-inflammatory drugs, especially those with analgesic properties. We believe that SCAs\nhave the potential to fulfill these needs and we have started to develop novel, orally available and patentable drug candidates to treat certain diseases or conditions such as\narthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, psoriasis, obesity and fatty liver, and various painful conditions. Our work on SCAs is currently in the preclinical development stage.\nBecause medical cannabis is a complex mixture of over 200 compounds from plants, providing a consistent level of the active compound of interest or controlling the\nlevel of the other natural compounds is difficult. Accordingly, we are working on orally available SCAs, not derived from plants, to address the deleterious issues of medical\ncannabis described above. If successful, these SCAs could become approved drug products that offer a robustly consistent and safe dosage that allows patient intake to be\ncarefully controlled.\nWe believe that the development and clinical study of SCAs will reveal that SCAs have several key advantages over medical cannabis, including:\n● use of a pure compound (>99.5%) rather than a mixture of compounds;\n● ability to test and control dosing, which in turn controls efficacy and side effect levels;\n● creation of a reproducible product; and\n● ability to engineer novel synthetic analogs to control binding preferences to select receptors, control agonist or antagonist effects of receptor binding\n(pharmacokinetics and dynamics), modify half-life of the drug in the body, and create pro-drug forms that are only activated in specified tissues, thereby\npotentially reducing off target side effects.\nIn addition to the above advantages, testing SCAs in scientific, double-blind clinical trials would help to allay physicians’ concerns regarding the therapeutic use of\nmarijuana-based compounds. This change could increase the number of patients that have access to these drug therapies. If clinical trials are successful, there are a number of\npotential markets and indications for SCAs which we could target, which include individuals suffering from chronic and recurrent pain, diabetes, osteoarthritis, obesity and\nfatty liver disease.\nα7nAChR Platform\nOverview\nTwo of our lead scientists, Prof. Steinman and Dr. Rothbard, previously identified a key receptor for the amyloid proteins associated with diseases like Alzheimer’s\nand Parkinson’s disease, called α7nAChR. The α7nAChR is expressed on the surface of both neuronal cells in the brain and on cells of the immune system. The research\nconducted by Dr. Rothbard and Prof. Steinman has shown that small molecules available as drugs taken by mouth can engage this receptor and potently reduce inflammatory\ndiseases. Dr. Rothbard and Prof. Steinman have shown that this receptor is critical in reducing disease in animal models of multiple sclerosis and RA, as well as heart attack and\nstroke.\nOur efforts to understand the role of the high concentration of small heat shock proteins (“sHsp”) found in the lesions in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis\nled us to realize that the protein was (i) immune suppressive and (ii) therapeutic in animal 2 models of multiple sclerosis, cardiac and retinal ischemia, and stroke. A significant\nrealization was that amyloid fibrils composed of proteins or small peptides exhibited biological responses equivalent to the sHsps. The fibrils and the sHsps specifically bound\nand activated macrophages (“MΦ”) and regulatory B cells. Crosslinking and precipitation experiments demonstrated that both species bound nAChR and signaled through\nJak2/Stat3. We realized that nicotine treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (“EAE”) induces an identical pattern of immune suppression as our treatments\nand exhibits pre-clinical efficacy that is comparable with many of the drugs that are approved for multiple sclerosis (MS) when they were tested in EAE models. Collectively,\nthese observations have informed our strategy to develop an orally available, small molecule agonist of α7nAChR for inflammation and autoimmune diseases.\n11\nThe α7 subunit of α7nAChR is an integral part of an endogenous immune suppressive pathway, in which activation of the vagus nerve stimulates acetylcholine\nsecretion, which in turn binds α7nAChR on MΦs and regulatory B lymphocytes. Activation of the MΦs initiates an immunosuppressive cascade of events that lead to reduction\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppression of B and T cell activation and control of inflammation.\nIn autoimmune diseases like RA, where there is intense inflammation destroying joints, and in multiple sclerosis, where the brain is under attack with damage to vital\nneurologic circuits, the body’s immune system turns against its own tissues. Other diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to gout, also reveal manifestations of an unwanted\nautoimmune attack.\nActivation of the α7nAChR results in a signaling cascade involving Jak2 and Stat3 leading to the conversion of the macrophages to an immune suppressive phenotype\nand the production of IL-10. IL-10 is known to reduce inflammatory cytokines, most prominently TNF, IL-1, and IL-6. Consequently, α7nAChR agonists should complement\nanti-TNF therapy, which opens up the possibility of developing a new class of orally available medicines which are anti-inflammatory but much safer than existing medications\nsuch as NSAIDS, Cox2 inhibitors, methotrexate, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. This is because α7nAChR agonists are activating an endogenous regulatory pathway, rather\nthan blocking important pathways needed for diverse processes. The market opportunity arises from the complex and expensive effort by several large and small biotechnology\ncompanies in the development of a spectrum of orally available partial agonists specific for α7nAChR. The compounds underwent extensive preclinical assessment and were\nused in 18 studies comprising 2,670 subjects.\nThe drugs universally were shown to be safe, but ineffective in trials for neurologic and psychiatric diseases, namely Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. In\nrandomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials for cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, the compounds failed to meet their primary endpoint.\nWe plan to use these previous studies as a foundation to potentially develop a patentable α7nAChR analog within this family to use as an immune suppressive to treat a\nrange of inflammatory and autoimmune indications including RA, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis,\ngout and osteoarthritis. Our scientists have found that the α7 receptor on macrophages and regulatory B lymphocytes are different from the target of the drugs developed so far.\nProduct Candidates or Indications\nWe intend to identify, characterize, synthesize, and patent an orally available small molecular weight agonist of α7nAChR by screening non-patented analogs of large\nnumbers of known agonists defined by pharmaceutical companies. We intend to outsource this work to Evotec GMBH, an integrated early discovery organization, and one\nwhich we have worked with in the past, specializing in ion channels and transporters, offering clients specialized technologies and scientific expertise to move from target to\nlead compounds.\nFollowing a safety and efficacy assessment program, we intend to select candidates for pre-clinical development as a prelude to the potential initiation of clinical\nstudies, which could potentially be followed by an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to the FDA. Our first intended target indication for its α7nAChR\ndevelopment platform is smoking cessation induced ulcerative colitis.\nUntil we are able obtain sufficient capital to pursue this program, we do not expect to make significant progress with our α7nAChR platform.\n12\nOutsourcing and Manufacturing\nWe are currently outsourcing our clinical trials, which are conducted at Oxford University, Edinburgh, U.K. and Groningen, The Netherlands, and only involve certain\nindications under the anti-TNF platform. We expect to continue to outsource our clinical trials and conduct them at (1) in the case of the anti-TNF platform, Oxford University\nand Groningen, The Netherlands, (2) in the case of the SCAs platform, Hebrew University and Oxford University, and (3) in the case of the α7nAChR platform, to be\ndetermined.\nWe also expect to outsource all of our manufacturing activities, including those activities at the research or clinical stage, with SCAs to be produced at Hebrew\nUniversity and α7nAChR to be produced by Evotec GMBH and the anti-TNF platform utilizing off-the-shelf adalimumab. In addition, we expect our products to be good\nmanufacturing practice (GMP) grade and produced by accredited contract research organizations (CROs).\nMaterial Agreements\nWe have entered into material research and licensing agreements (the “Research Agreements”) with various universities and parties in order to conduct research to\ndevelop potential product candidates. We have also entered into other material consulting and advisory services agreements with various scientists (the “Consulting\nAgreements”) to assist with such research.\nOverview of Research Agreements\nThe Research Agreements include agreements with the Hebrew University and Oxford. For the anti-TNF platform, the Research Agreements with Oxford allow us to\ncontribute financially to sponsor the research being conducted for the anti-TNF platform. In return, we will receive an exclusive option to license any intellectual property\narising from the Research Agreements. There are also license agreements in place whereby we have exclusively licensed certain intellectual property from Oxford.\nFor the SCA program, we have agreements in place with Hebrew University and Oxford, pursuant to which we intend to conduct research to develop and characterize\nnovel SCAs for the treatment of certain target indications, and to perform early-phase clinical trials. Through the Research Agreements with Hebrew University and Oxford, we\nestablished research facilities at the Hebrew University and Oxford, in which the development and testing of new cannabinoids designed and synthesized at the Hebrew\nUniversity will be facilitated.\nThe Research Agreements are each described below.\nResearch Agreements with the Hebrew University\nOn May 13, 2018, our wholly-owned subsidiary CBR Pharma entered into a research and license agreement (the “2018 Hebrew Agreement”) with Yissum Research\nDevelopment Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Ltd.

The termination letter also\nclarified amounts that we owed after termination of the License, including approximately $20,000 in unbilled fees. No material early termination penalties were incurred by the\nCompany in connection with the termination of the license.\nStanford License Agreement\nOn May 8, 2018, Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of our wholly-owned subsidiary Katexco, entered into an option agreement (the\n“Stanford Option”) with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”), pursuant to which Stanford granted Katexco an option to acquire an\nexclusive license for the development and commercialization of certain inventions. In consideration for the Stanford Option, Katexco paid Stanford $10,000 (the “Option\nPayment”), creditable against the license issue fee agreement.\nOn July 25, 2018 (the “Stanford Effective Date”), Katexco exercised the Stanford Option, and entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Stanford License\nAgreement”) with Stanford, pursuant to which Katexco was granted the rights to certain U.S. patents related to (i) alpha B-crystallin as a therapy for autoimmune demyelination\nand (ii) peptides as short as six amino acids that form amyloid fibrils that activate B-1 cells and macrophages and are anti-inflammatory and therapeutic in autoimmune and\nneurodegenerative diseases (the “Stanford Licensed Patents”). Through the Stanford License Agreement, Katexco established research facilities at Stanford. We will support the\nclinical development of the lead compound(s), culminating in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials to establish potential clinical utility in ulcerative colitis indications.\nUnder the Stanford License Agreement, no rights of Stanford, including intellectual property rights, are granted to Katexco other than those rights granted under the\nStanford Licensed Patents.\nAs consideration for the grant of the Stanford Licensed Patents, Katexco paid Stanford an initial fee of $50,000, inclusive of the Option Payment. We also issued 294\ncommon shares to Stanford and provided a letter stating the value of such shares. A portion of the shares issued to Stanford were later distributed to five individuals, including\nour Chief Scientific Officer and co-chairman.\nBeginning upon the first anniversary of the Stanford Effective Date and each anniversary thereafter, Katexco will pay Stanford an annual license maintenance fee of\n$20,000 on the first and second anniversaries and $40,000 on each subsequent anniversary. Furthermore, Katexco is obligated to make the following payments, including\n(i) $100,000 upon initiation of Phase 2 trial, (ii) $500,000 upon the first FDA approval of a product (the “Licensed Product”) resulting from the Stanford Licensed Patents, and\n(iii) $250,000 upon each new Licensed Product thereafter. Royalties, calculated at 2.5% of net sales (calculated as gross revenue received by Katexco or its sublicensees, their\ndistributors or designees, from the sale, transfer or other disposition of products based on the Stanford Licensed Patents minus 5%), will be payable to Stanford. In addition,\nKatexco has reimbursed Stanford $51,385 to offset the Stanford Licensed Patent’s patenting expenses and will reimburse Stanford for all Stanford Licensed Patent’s patenting\nexpenses, including any interference and or re-examination matters, incurred by Stanford after March 3, 2018.\n18\nWe can terminate the Stanford License Agreement without cause by providing a 30-day notice. In the case of a change of control, upon the assignment of the Stanford\nLicense Agreement, Katexco is obligated to pay Stanford a $200,000 change of control fee. The Stanford License Agreement also provides Stanford with the right to purchase\nfor cash up to either (i) 10% or (ii) the percentage necessary for Stanford to maintain its pro rata ownership interest in Katexco, of Katexco’s equity securities issued in a private\noffering. The shares issued to Stanford in connection with the Stanford License Agreement, gave Stanford and the five individuals who received a portion of the shares a total\nownership of 2.11% in Katexco’s stock, prior to the July 2019, corporate restructuring completed between 180 and each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma, pursuant to\nwhich 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma became wholly-owned subsidiaries of 180LS (the “Reorganization”) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).\nThe Petcanna Agreement\nOn August 20, 2018, we entered into a sublicense agreement with Petcanna Pharma Corp. (“Petcanna”), a private company which was founded by Prof. Sir Marc\nFeldmann (our Executive Co-Chairman), and Yissum (the “Petcanna Agreement”).\nUnder the Petcanna Agreement, we granted Petcanna an exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable, non-sublicensable sublicense to make commercial use of certain\npatents related to cyclohexenyl compounds and listed in the Petcanna Agreement (the “Petcanna IP”) in order to develop, manufacture, market, distribute or sell products that\nincorporate the Petcanna IP in products that are intended for the treatment of veterinary medical conditions, initially osteoarthritis.\nAs consideration for the sublicense, Petcanna agreed to issue to us approximately 9,000,000 of Petcanna’s common shares in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of the date\nof this Report, Petcanna has not issued shares to any stockholder and has not commenced operations. We intend to retain 85% of such shares and transfer 15% of such shares to\nYissum. In the event that Yissum does not accept such shares, we will have an obligation to pay Yissum 15% of the-then current fair market value of such shares. Petcanna will\nalso pay a 1% royalty to us on Petcanna’s net sales of products that incorporate the Petcanna IP.\nAll right, title and interest in and to the Petcanna IP, including any improvements to the Petcanna IP, will vest solely in our company.\nUnless the parties to the Petcanna Agreement agree otherwise in writing, the Petcanna Agreement will terminate on the occurrence of the later of: (i) the date of\nexpiration of the last of the Petcanna IP, (ii) the date of the final expiration of exclusivity on any Product granted by any regulatory or government body, and (iii) the expiration\nof a continuous period of twenty (20) years during which there was no First Commercial Sale of any product. The terms “Product” and “First Commercial Sale” apply as they\nare defined in the Petcanna Agreement. Our ability to grant this sublicense to Petcanna is contingent upon (i) Yissum having the necessary rights to the Hebrew Patent\nApplications assigned to it from all applicable parties, (ii) Yissum being able to grant a license to us per the terms of the Hebrew Agreement, and (iii) the Hebrew Patent\nApplications and any related resulting patents being valid and maintained in good standing for the respective terms of the Hebrew Licensing Agreement and the Petcanna\nAgreement.\nKennedy License Agreement\nOn September 27, 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary 180 LP entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Kennedy License Agreement”) with the Kennedy\nTrust For Rheumatology Research (“Kennedy”), pursuant to which Kennedy granted to 180 LP an exclusive license in the U.S., Japan and member countries of the EU\n(including the United Kingdom), to certain licensed patents (the “Kennedy Licensed Patents”), including the right to grant sublicenses, and the right to research, develop, sell or\nmanufacture any pharmaceutical product (i) whose research, development, manufacture, use, importation or sale would infringe on the Kennedy Licensed Patents absent the\nlicense granted under the Kennedy License Agreement or (ii) containing an antibody that is a fragment of or derived from an antibody whose research, development,\nmanufacture, use, importation or sale would infringe on the Kennedy Licensed Patents absent the license granted under the Kennedy License Agreement, for all human uses,\nincluding the diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of diseases and conditions.\n19\nUnder the Kennedy License Agreement, Kennedy reserves the perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, worldwide right for the Kennedy\nLicensed Patents and its affiliates, employees, students and other researchers to carry out any acts which would otherwise infringe on the Kennedy Licensed Patents for the\npurposes of teaching and carrying out research and development, including the right to accept external sponsorship for such research and development and the right to grant\nsub-licenses for the same purposes.\nAs consideration for the grant of the Kennedy Licensed Patents, 180 LP paid Kennedy an upfront fee of £60,000, and will also pay Kennedy royalties equal to (i) 1%\nof the net sales for the first annual $1 billion of net sales, and (ii) 2% of the net sales after the net sales are at or in excess of $1 billion, as well as 25% of all sublicense revenue,\nprovided that the amount of such percentage of sublicense revenue based on amounts which constitute royalties shall not be less than 1% on the first cumulative $1 billion of\nnet sales of the products sold by such sublicenses or their affiliates, and 2% on that portion of the cumulative net sales of the products sold by such sublicenses or their affiliates\nin excess of $1 billion.\nThe term of the royalties paid to Kennedy will expire on the later of (i) the last valid claim of a patent included in the Kennedy Licensed Patents which covers or\nclaims the exploitation of a product in the applicable country; (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the product in the country; or (iii) 10 years from first commercial\nsale of the product in the country.\nWe may terminate the Kennedy License Agreement without cause by providing 90-days’ notice.\nKinexum Agreement\nOn January 13, 2023, we entered into a contract with Kinexum in the ordinary course of business (the “MSA”). Pursuant to the MSA, Kinexum will provide assistance\nto us in connection with the Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) and Marketing Approval Application (MAA) which we expect to submit to the MHRA in connection\nwith our planned use of adalimumab to treat progressive early-stage Dupuytren’s disease. We do not anticipate significant costs related to the Kinexum agreement in 2024, as\nthe Company is now required to complete a Phase 3 trial in Dupuytren’s disease prior to submission of an MAA.\nConsulting Agreements\nThe Consulting Agreements are each described below.\nProf. Jagdeep Nanchahal Consulting Agreement\nOn February 25, 2021, we (and CannBioRex Pharma Limited, which was added as a party to the agreement later), entered into a Consultancy Agreement dated\nFebruary 22, 2021, and effective December 1, 2020, with Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal (as amended, the “Consulting Agreement”). Prof. Nanchahal has been providing services to\nus and/or our subsidiaries since 2014, was previously a greater than 5% stockholder of the Company and is currently the Chairman of our Clinical Advisory Board.\nOn March 31, 2021, we entered into a first amendment to Consultancy Agreement with Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal (the “First Nanchahal Amendment”), which amended\nthe Consultancy Agreement entered into with Prof. Nanchahal on February 25, 2021, to include CannBioRex Pharma Limited, a corporation incorporated and registered in\nEngland and Wales (“CannBioRex”), and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as a party thereto, and to update the prior Consultancy Agreement to provide\nfor cash payments due to Prof. Nanchahal to be paid by CannBioRex, for tax purposes, provide for CannBioRex to be party to certain other provisions of the agreement and to\nprovide for the timing of certain cash bonuses due under the terms of the agreement.\nProf. Nanchahal is a surgeon scientist focusing on defining the molecular mechanisms of common diseases and translating his findings through to early phase clinical\ntrials. He undertook his Ph.D., funded by the U.K. Medical Research Council, whilst a medical student in London and led a lab group funded by external grants throughout his\nsurgical training. After completing fellowships in microsurgery and hand surgery in the USA and Australia, he was appointed as a senior lecturer at Imperial College. His\nresearch is focused on promoting tissue regeneration by targeting endogenous stem cells and reducing fibrosis. In 2013 his group identified anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as\ntherapeutic target for Dupuytren’s Contracture, a common fibrotic condition of the hand. He previously lead a Phase 2b clinical trial funded by the Wellcome Trust and\nDepartment of Health to assess the efficacy of local administration of anti-TNF in patients with early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture and a clinical trial for patients with early-\nstage frozen shoulder. He is a proponent of evidence-based medicine and was the only plastic surgery member of the NICE Guidance Development Groups on complex and\nnon-complex fractures. He was a member of the group that wrote the Standards for the Management of Open Fractures published in 2020. This is an open-source publication to\nfacilitate the care of patients with these severe injuries.\n20\nPursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Prof. Nanchahal agreed, during the term of the agreement, to serve as a consultant to us and provide such services as the Chief\nExecutive Officer and/or our Board shall request from time to time, including but not be limited to: (1) conducting clinical trials in the fields of Dupuytren’s Contracture, frozen\nshoulder and post-operative delirium/cognitive decline; and (2) conducting laboratory research in other fibrotic disorders, including fibrosis of the liver and lung (collectively,\nthe “Services”).\nIn consideration for providing the Services, we (through CannBioRex Pharma Limited) agreed to pay Prof. Nanchahal 15,000 British Pounds (GBP) per month\n(approximately $20,800) during the term of the agreement, increasing to GBP 23,000 (approximately $32,000) on the date (a) of publication of the data from the phase 2b\nclinical trial for Dupuytren’s Contracture (RIDD) and (b) the date that we have successfully raised over $15 million in capital. The fee will increase annually thereafter to\nreflect progression in other clinical trials and laboratory research as approved by our Board. We also agreed to pay Prof. Nanchahal a bonus (“Bonus 1”) in the sum of GBP\n100,000 upon submission of the Dupuytren’s Contracture clinical trial data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, which submission occurred in December 2021, and which\nbonus was paid in December 2021. In addition, for prior work performed, including completion of the recruitment to the RIDD (Dupuytren’s) trial, we agreed to pay Prof.\nNanchahal GBP 434,673 (approximately $605,000) (“Bonus 2”). At the election of Prof. Nanchahal, Bonus 2 shall be paid at least 50% (fifty percent) or more, as Prof.\nNanchahal elects, in shares of our common stock, at a share price of $1,140.00 per share, or the share price on the date of the grant, whichever is lower, with the remainder paid\nin GBP. Bonus 2 shall be deemed earned and payable upon us raising a minimum of $15 million in additional funding, through the sale of debt or equity, after December 1,\n2020 (the “Vesting Date”) and shall not be accrued, due or payable prior to such Vesting Date. Bonus 2 shall be payable by us within 30 calendar days of the Vesting Date.\nFinally, Prof. Nanchahal shall receive another one-time bonus (“Bonus 3”) of GBP 5,000 (approximately $7,000) on enrollment of the first patient to the phase 2 frozen\nshoulder trial, and another one-time bonus (“Bonus 4”) of GBP 5,000 (approximately $7,000) for enrollment of the first patient to the phase 2 delirium/POCD trial. On March\n30, 2021, we issued Prof. Nanchahal 265 shares of our common stock in lieu of GBP 217,337 and on April 15, 2021, we issued Prof. Nanchahal 99 shares of our common stock\nin lieu of GBP 82,588. We also waived the requirement for the Company having to raise $15 million in order for Prof. Nanchahal to agree to receive an aggregate of GBP\n300,000 via the issuance of shares. Prof. Nanchahal agreed that the remaining GBP 134,673 that is due pursuant to Bonus 2 shall be paid after we have raised a minimum of\n$15 million in additional funding. On August 23, 2021, at the request of Prof. Nanchahal, we agreed to issue Prof. Nanchahal 161 shares of common stock in consideration for\nthe remaining 31% (or 134,749 GBP, or $184,606) of Bonus 2, based on a $1,140.00 per share price. The shares were issued under our 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which has\nbeen approved by stockholders.\nEffective on April 27, 2022, we and CannBioRex entered into a Second Amendment to Consulting Agreement with Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal (the “Second Nanchahal\nAmendment”). Pursuant to the Second Nanchahal Amendment, Prof. Nanchahal agreed that upon acceptance of the data for the phase 2b clinical trial for Dupuytren’s disease\nfor publication (which occurred March 1, 2022, subject to editing and final approvals), his monthly fee was increased to £23,000, provided that £4,000 of such increase shall be\naccrued and £19,000 per month of such fees shall be payable per our payroll practices in cash by us starting effective March 1, 2022, and until the earlier of (a) November 1,\n2022 or (b) such time as our Board determines that we have sufficient cash on hand to pay such accrued amounts, which we expect will not be until we have raised a minimum\nof $15,000,000 (the “Funding Determination Date”), at which time all accrued amounts shall be due.\nOn December 28, 2022, we and CannBioRex, entered into a Third Amendment to Consultancy Agreement with Prof. Nanchahal (the “Third Nanchahal Amendment”).\nThe Third Nanchahal Amendment amended the Consultancy Agreement to provide that the monthly cash fee payable to Prof. Nanchahal pursuant to such agreement would\nremain at its then current rate, £23,000 per month, through December 31, 2022, and then increase to £35,000 per month during the term of the Consultancy Agreement from\nJanuary 1, 2023, until the end of the term of the Consultancy Agreement (collectively, the “Fee”). The Third Nanchahal Amendment also provided that the Fee will be adjusted\nyearly with the recommendation of our Board or the Compensation Committee of the Company, which will consider in its determination of the amount of such increase, the\nU.K. consumer price index and Prof. Nanchahal’s contributions to advancing our mission, among other things. The Third Nanchahal Amendment also provided that in the event\nthe Consultancy Agreement is terminated by us for any reason other than cause, Prof. Nanchahal is entitled to a lump sum payment of 12 months of his monthly fee as of the\ndate of termination.\n21\nNotwithstanding the above, the Board or Compensation Committee of the Company may grant Prof. Nanchahal additional bonuses from time to time in their\ndiscretion, in cash, stock or options.\nThe Consulting Agreement has an initial term of three years, and renews thereafter for additional three-year terms, until terminated as provided in the agreement, and\ncurrently has a term through December 1, 2026. The Consulting Agreement can be terminated by either party with 12 months prior written notice (provided our right to\nterminate the agreement may only be exercised if Prof. Nanchahal fails to perform his required duties under the Consulting Agreement), or by us immediately if (a) Prof.\nNanchahal fails or neglects efficiently and diligently to perform the Services or is guilty of any breach of its or his obligations under the agreement (including any consent\ngranted under it); (b) Prof. Nanchahal is guilty of any fraud or dishonesty or acts in a manner (whether in the performance of the Services or otherwise) which, in our\nreasonable opinion, has brought or is likely to bring Prof. Nanchahal, the Company or any of its affiliates into disrepute or is convicted of an arrestable offence (other than a\nroad traffic offence for which a non-custodial penalty is imposed); or (c) Prof. Nanchahal becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors. If the\nConsulting Agreement is terminated by us for any reason other than cause, Prof. Nanchahal is entitled to a lump sum payment of 12 months of his fee as at the date of\ntermination.\nThe Consulting Agreement includes a 12 month non-compete and non-solicitation obligation of Prof. Nanchahal, preventing him from competing against us in any part\nof any country in which he was actively engaged in our business, subject to certain exceptions, including research conducted at the University of Oxford. The Consulting\nAgreement also includes customary confidentiality and assignment of inventions provisions, in each case subject to our previously existing agreements with various\nuniversities, including the University of Oxford, where Prof. Nanchahal serves as a Professor of Hand, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.\nService Agreement with Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann\nOn June 1, 2018, CannBioRex Pharma Limited (“CannBioRex”) and Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann Ph.D., our Executive Co-Chairman, entered into a Service Agreement\n(the “Feldmann Employment Agreement”). Pursuant to the Feldmann Employment Agreement, Prof. Sir Feldmann serves as the Chairman, CEO and Executive Director of\nCannBioRex or in such other capacity consistent with his status. Prof. Sir Feldmann’s responsibilities include those customary for the roles in which he serves. Prof. Sir\nFeldmann receives compensation of £115,000 per year, with annual compensation reviewed by the Board and eligibility for discretionary bonuses, as determined by the Board.\nCannBioRex also reimburses Prof. Sir Feldmann’s travelling and other business expenses.\nPursuant to the Feldmann Employment Agreement, all intellectual property rights created by Prof. Sir Feldmann or related to his employment belong to and vest in\nCannBioRex.\nThe Feldmann Employment Agreement contains a customary non-compete clause prohibiting Prof. Sir Feldmann from working for any competing businesses during\nthe term of his employment, or holding equity in other businesses, except he may hold or beneficially own securities of publicly-traded companies if the aggregate beneficial\ninterests of him and his family does not exceed 5% of that class of securities.\nProf. Sir Feldmann is also prohibited for 12 months following termination (the “Post-Termination Period”) to be involved in any capacity with a competing business or\npotential joint venture in the United Kingdom or in any other country. During the Post-Termination Period, he may not solicit business from CannBioRex and its affiliates’\ncustomers; or any company with whom he was actively involved in the course of his employment; or about which he holds confidential information. Prof. Sir Feldmann further\ncovenants to not interfere with CannBioRex’s business relationships by inducing or attempting to induce suppliers to take adverse actions during the Post-Termination Period.\nHe also agrees not to induce or attempt to induce any CannBioRex employee to leave the company during the Post-Termination Period. The Feldmann Employment Agreement\ncontains customary non-disclosure and confidentiality obligations, sick leave and vacation time.\nThe Feldmann Employment Agreement does not have a fixed term. Either party may terminate the agreement by delivering written notice 9 months in advance.\nCannBioRex may also terminate the Feldmann Employment Agreement at any time with immediate effect by giving written notice. If CannBioRex terminates Prof. Sir\nFeldmann’s employment without providing 9 months written notice, he will become entitled to a payment equal to his basic salary he would have been entitled to receive if 9\nmonths’ notice were given. The governing law for the Feldmann Employment Agreement is the law of England.\n22\nThe Board, as recommended by the Compensation Committee of the Company (and/or the Compensation Committee) or separately, may also award Prof. Sir\nFeldmann bonuses from time to time (in stock, options, cash, or other forms of consideration) in its discretion.\nOn November 17, 2021, the Board, as recommended by the Compensation Committee, increased the salary of Prof. Sir Feldmann to $225,000 per annum.\nEffective on April 27, 2022, CannBioRex and Prof. Sir Feldmann entered into an amendment to the consulting agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed\neffective March 1, 2022, that Sir Feldmann’s salary would be reduced by $225,000 (100%), and that such reduced amounts would be accrued and paid on the Funding\nDetermination Date.\nOn January 10, 2024, and effective on January 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Consulting Agreement with Prof. Sir Feldmann. Pursuant to\nthe amendment, Prof. Sir Feldmann, effective as of January 1, 2024, agreed to a reduction of his base salary set forth in his consulting agreement by 100%, to £0 per year, with\nthe amount of such salary reduction £14,167 per month or £170,000 per year), accruing monthly in arrears, to be paid upon the Company raising at least $5,000,000 in funding\nsubsequent to the date of the Amendments (the “Funding Date”), provided that in the event the Funding Date does not occur prior to March 15, 2025, the amounts accrued will\nbe forgiven in their entirety.\nOn March 7, 2024, Sir Marc Feldmann, Ph.D. provided notice to the Board of Directors of his resignation as a member of the Board of Directors, effective on the same\ndate; see Note 13 – Subsequent Events, Resignation of Board Member, for further information.\nConsultancy Agreement with Prof. Lawrence Steinman\nOn November 17, 2021, and effective on November 1, 2021, we entered into a Consulting Agreement with Lawrence Steinman, M.D., our Executive Co-Chairman\n(the “Consulting Agreement”). Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Dr. Steinman agreed to provide certain consulting services to us, including, but not limited to,\nparticipating in defining and setting strategic objectives of the Company; actively seeking out acquisition and merger candidates; and having primary scientific responsibility\nfor our α7nAChR platform (collectively, the “Services”). The term of the agreement is for one year (the “Initial Term”); provided that the agreement automatically extends for\nadditional one year periods after the Initial Term (each an “Automatic Renewal Term” and the Initial Term together with all Automatic Renewal Terms, if any, the “Term”),\nsubject to the Renewal Requirements (described below), in the event that neither party provided the other written notice of their intent not to automatically extend the term of\nthe agreement at least 30 days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Automatic Renewal Term. The Term can only be extended for an Automatic Renewal Term, provided\nthat (i) Dr. Steinman is re-elected to the Board at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders immediately preceding the date that such Automatic Renewal Term begins; (ii) the Board\naffirms his appointment as Co-Chairman for the applicable Automatic Renewal Term (or fails to appoint someone else as Co-Chairman prior to such applicable Automatic\nRenewal Term) and (iii) Dr. Steinman is continuing in his role of having the responsibility for the scientific development for the Company’s α7nAChR platform (the “Renewal\nRequirements”). The Consulting Agreement also expires immediately upon the earlier of: (i) the date upon which Dr. Steinman no longer serves as Co-Chairman and no longer\nhas primary scientific responsibility for our α7nAChR platform; and (ii) any earlier date requested by either (1) us (as evidenced by a vote of a majority of the Board (excluding\nDr. Steinman) at a meeting of the Board), or (2) Dr. Steinman (as evidenced by written notice from Dr. Steinman to the Board). Additionally, we may terminate the Consulting\nAgreement immediately and without prior notice if Dr. Steinman is unable or refuses to perform the Services, and either party may terminate the Consulting Agreement\nimmediately and without prior notice if the other party is in breach of any material provision of the Consulting Agreement.\nWe agreed to pay Dr. Steinman $225,000 per year during the term of the agreement, along with a one-time payment of $43,750, representing the difference between\nhis old compensation and new compensation, dating back to April 1, 2021. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Dr. Steinman agreed to not compete against us, unless\napproved in writing by the Board, during the term of the agreement, and also agreed to certain customary confidentiality provisions and assignment of inventions requirements.\nThe Consulting Agreement also has a 12-month non-solicitation prohibition following its termination.\n23\nOn December 8, 2021, Dr. Steinman was also granted stock options to purchase 65 shares of our common stock, which have a term of 10 years; an exercise price equal\nto the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, $1,501.00 per share, and are subject to our 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan. In addition, beginning in calendar\nyear 2022, for each year during the Term of the Consulting Agreement, we will, subject to future approval by the Board, grant Dr. Steinman $125,000 of value of equity\ncompensation. Future equity grants will vest over a 48-month period and be in accordance with the Plan. Timing of the future grants, nature of the equity grants (e.g., RSU,\nPSU, restricted stock, etc.) and any changes in the value of future equity will be recommended by our Compensation Committee and/or Audit Committee and approved by the\nBoard.\nEffective on April 27, 2022, the Company and Dr. Steinman entered into an amendment to the consulting agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed effective\nMarch 1, 2022, that Dr. Steinman’s salary would be reduced by $56,250 (25%), and that such reduced amount would be accrued and paid on the Funding Determination Date.\nOn January 10, 2024, and effective on January 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Third Amendment to Consulting Agreement with Lawrence Steinman. Pursuant to\nthe amendment, Dr. Steinman, effective as of January 1, 2024, agreed to a reduction of his base salary set forth in his consulting agreement by 100%, to $0 per year, with the\namount of such salary reduction ($18,750 per month or $225,000 per year), accruing monthly in arrears, to be paid on the Funding Date, provided that in the event the Funding\nDate does not occur prior to March 15, 2025, the amounts accrued will be forgiven in their entirety.\nRecent and Material Events\nOn January 13, 2023, the Company entered into a contract with Kinexum in the ordinary course of business (the “MSA”). Pursuant to the MSA, Kinexum will provide\nassistance to the Company in connection with the Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) and Marketing Approval Application (MAA) which the Company expects to\nsubmit to the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in connection with the Company’s planned use of adalimumab to treat progressive early-\nstage Dupuytren’s disease. We do not anticipate significant costs related to the Kinexum agreement in 2024, as the Company is now required to complete a Phase 3 trial in\nDupuytren’s disease prior to submission of an MAA.\nAs previously discussed, the Company’s HMGB1 program was formed in connection with the entry into an exclusive global licensing agreement with Oxford\nUniversity Innovation Limited (“Oxford”) for the development and commercialization of HMGB1, a regenerative molecule for promoting liver repair and regeneration, in\nNovember 2021 (the “License”). At the time, a physiological pathway, activated by the molecule HMGB1, had been shown to lead to regeneration of tissues by targeting\nendogenous stem and progenitor cells. However, after close to two years of research, it was found that the molecular interactions were much more complex than initially\nenvisioned and have remained unresolved. Hence, we have been unable to progress this research to a point of identifying a lead molecule to proceed with scaling up and Good\nManufacturing Practice (GMP) production, as well as safety and toxicity testing.\nDue to the ongoing costs of this research program and the need for the Company to focus its resources on the Company’s primary platform to treat fibrosis using anti-\nTNF (tumor necrosis factor), the Board of Directors of the Company elected to terminate the Company’s HMGB1 license agreement with Oxford on September 22, 2023, and\non September 22, 2023, the Company and Oxford entered into a termination letter, formally terminating the License effective September 22, 2023. The termination letter also\nclarified amounts that we owed after termination of the License, including approximately $20,000 in unbilled fees. No material early termination penalties were incurred by the\nCompany in connection with the termination of the license.\nOn October 12, 2023, the Company received a formal written scientific response from the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency\n(MHRA) regarding a meeting that was held on August 17, 2023 with the MHRA. The Company’s management and regulatory team met with the MHRA to propose a path\nforward for approval of the Company’s use of adalimumab as an anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor) therapy for the potential prevention of the Dupuytren’s contracture disability.\nIn the response, the MHRA (i) recognized the debilitating nature of the Dupuytren’s Contracture; (ii) agreed with the Company’s proposed primary and secondary\nendpoints for a proposed Phase 3 clinical trial (Phase 3 study); (iii) agreed that a single Phase 3 study could be sufficient to support a Marketing Authorization, if convincing\nevidence of efficacy and safety is observed; (iv) confirmed that the MHRA believes that the results of the Company’s Phase 2b trial resulted in too much uncertainty to support\na Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA), because of the small number of trial participants, and that the MHRA would require the results of a Phase 3 study to consider a\nMarketing Authorisation; and (v) provided the Company guidance on the potential Phase 3 study, including that a treatment course consisting of four injections administered at\n3-monthly intervals is acceptable.\n24\nThe Company is also currently interacting with the FDA, and is ready to liaise with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), to attempt to obtain agreement on our\nproposed clinical development plans, as outlined above for the MHRA guidance, and to work towards seeking approval of the use of adalimumab as an anti-TNF therapy for\npotential prevention of the Dupuytren’s contracture disability, in all of these jurisdictions.\nIn support of our current FDA interaction, a leading pharmaceutical biosimilar manufacturer has agreed to participate with the Company in the FDA advice discussion\nregarding manufacturing and safety of the proposed biosimilar for adalimumab. In addition, such manufacturer has indicated that it wishes to supply the anti-TNF biosimilar\ndrug to be used in the Phase 3 study; however, no definitive agreements with the supplier have been entered into to date. It is expected that any agreements with such supplier\nwould be conditional upon the outcome of the aforementioned FDA discussions, and we may be unable to come to mutually agreeable definitive terms with such supplier.\nThe Company is currently taking into consideration the guidance from the MHRA in its discussions with the FDA and planning the potential Phase 3 study to be\ncarried out, if necessary, provided that funding for such study is available.\nIn December 2023, we engaged A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners as financial advisor to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value.\nPotential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include, but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, reverse merger,\nother business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic transactions involving the Company. The Company does not intend to discuss or disclose further\ndevelopments during this process unless and until its Board of Directors has approved a specific action or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate. There is\nno assurance that the strategic review process will result in the approval or completion of any specific transaction or outcome.\nOur common stock and Public Warrants trade on Nasdaq under the symbols “ATNF” and “ATNFW,” respectively. Notwithstanding such listing, there can be no\nassurance any broker will be interested in trading our securities. Therefore, it may be difficult to sell our securities publicly. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to\nmaintain our listings on Nasdaq for any period of time by perpetually satisfying Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\nOn September 7, 2023, the Company received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the\nCompany that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the\nminimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company’s\ncommon stock for the thirty (30) consecutive business days from July 26, 2023 to September 6, 2023, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement.\nThe notification letter stated that the Company has 180 calendar days or until March 5, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain\ncompliance, the bid price of the Company’s common stock must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. If the\nCompany does not regain compliance by March 5, 2024, an additional 180 days may be granted to regain compliance, so long as the Company meets The Nasdaq Capital\nMarket initial listing criteria (except for the bid price requirement) and notifies Nasdaq in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by\neffecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company does not qualify for the second compliance period or fails to regain compliance during the second 180-day period,\nthe Company’s common stock will be subject to delisting, at which point the Company would have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.\n25\nThe Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with\nthe minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, including affecting a reverse stock split. The Company plans to hold a special stockholders’ meeting on\nFebruary 16, 2024, to seek approval, for among other things, an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse\nstock split of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, by a ratio of between one-for-four to one-for-forty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole\nnumber to be determined by our Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof in its discretion, at any time after approval of the amendment and prior to February\n16, 2025. On February 16, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in the amount of one-\nfor-nineteen, which was effective on February 28, 2024. On March 13, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it has regained full\ncompliance with the minimum bid price for continued listing on Nasdaq, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), because Nasdaq has determined that for 10 consecutive\nbusiness days, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock was at or above $1.00 per share.\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the shareholder approval\nrequirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), which require prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving the issuance of 20% or\nmore of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the applicable Minimum Price (as defined in Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)).\nThe Staff’s determination under Listing Rule 5635(d) relates to the offering and issuance by the Company of an aggregate of: (i) 35,102 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock, at a price of $12.35 per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 207,814 shares of common stock, at a price of $12.3481 per pre-funded warrant and\n(iii) warrants to purchase up to 242,915 shares of common stock. The offering price per share and associated common warrant was $12.35 and the offering price per pre-funded\nwarrant and associated common warrant was $12.3481.\nThe Staff determined that the offering was not a “public offering” for the purposes of Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules due to the type of offering, a best efforts\noffering pursuant to a placement agency agreement, and the fact that one investor purchased 98% of the offering. As a result, because the offering represented greater than 20%\nof the common stock outstanding and was priced below the Minimum Price, the Staff determined that the Company was required to obtain prior shareholder approval under\nListing Rule 5635(d).\nThe October 11, 2023 letter provided the Company 45 days to submit a plan to regain compliance. The plan of compliance was subsequently submitted by the\nCompany to Nasdaq on November 9, 2023, and on November 14, 2023, Nasdaq granted the Company an extension, until December 15, 2023, to complete certain transactions\nset forth in the plan of compliance, in order to remedy its prior violation of Nasdaq rules as described in the October 11, 2023 letter from Nasdaq.\nOn August 14, 2023, we issued and sold to certain investors, including a certain institutional investor (the “Purchaser”), an aggregate of: (i) 35,102 shares (the “August\n2023 Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 207,814 shares of common stock, and\n(iii) warrants (the “August 2023 Common Warrants”) to purchase up to 242,915 shares of common stock, in the case of the Purchaser, pursuant to a securities purchase\nagreement, dated as of August 9, 2023, between the Company and the Purchaser (the “August 2023 SPA”).\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance\nwith the shareholder approval requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), which requires prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings,\ninvolving the issuance of 20% or more of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the applicable Minimum Price (as defined in Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)).\nNasdaq’s determination under Listing Rule 5635(d) related to the August 2023 offering (the “August 2023 Offering”). The offering price per share of common stock\nand associated August 2023 Common Warrant was $12.35 and the offering price per August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrant and associated August 2023 Common Warrant was\n$12.3481.\nNasdaq determined that the August 2023 Offering was not a “public offering” for the purposes of Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules due to the type of offering, a\nbest efforts offering pursuant to a placement agency agreement, and the fact that one investor purchased 98% of the August 2023 Offering. As a result, because the August 2023\nOffering represented greater than 20% of the common stock outstanding and was priced below the Minimum Price, Nasdaq determined that the Company was required to\nobtain prior shareholder approval under Listing Rule 5635(d). In November and December 2023, the Company took various actions to amend the terms of the August 2023\nOffering to comply with Listing Rule 5635(d), as discussed below.\n26\nOn November 28, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the August 2023 SPA with the Purchaser (the “November 2023 SPA Amendment”), pursuant\nto which (i) the Purchaser agreed to pay an additional $830,769.30 in connection with the repricing of the August 2023 Shares and August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants (the\n“Repricing Amount”), (ii) the Company agreed to issue to the Purchaser (x) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 257,205 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of\n$0.0019 per share (the “December 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants”), and (y) warrants to purchase up to 477,058 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $3.23 per share\n(the “December 2023 Common Warrants” and, together with the December 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants, the “Warrants”), and (iii) the Company and the Purchaser agreed to\nenter into the Warrant Amendment Agreement (as defined and described below).\nThe Warrants will not be exercisable until the Company obtains stockholder approval for the issuance of the 734,262 shares of common stock upon exercise of the\nWarrants (the “Warrant Shares”)(“Stockholder Approval”, and the date of such Stockholder Approval, the “Stockholder Approval Date”), at which point the December 2023\nPre-Funded Warrants will remain exercisable until all of the December 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full, and the December 2023 Common Warrants will remain\nexercisable until the fifth anniversary of the Stockholder Approval Date (as defined below).\nThe November 2023 SPA Amendment contains certain customary representations, warranties and agreements by the Company, customary conditions to closing,\nindemnification obligations of the Company, other obligations of the parties, and termination provisions. Pursuant to the November 2023 SPA Amendment, the Company has\nagreed that, subject to certain exceptions, it will not conduct any issuances of common stock (or equivalents thereof) from the Closing Date until 15 days after the Stockholder\nApproval Date. The November 2023 SPA Amendment also requires the Company to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale by the Purchaser of the\nWarrant Shares within sixty (60) days of the Stockholder Approval Date.\nIn accordance with the November 2023 SPA Amendment, the Company entered into a warrant amendment agreement with the Purchaser, dated November 28, 2023\n(the “Warrant Amendment Agreement”), whereby the Company agreed to amend the following outstanding warrants held by the Purchaser: (i) warrants to purchase up to\n135,339 shares of common stock, issued on December 22, 2022, and amended in January 2023, April 2023 and August 2023 (the “December 2022 Warrants”); (ii) warrants to\npurchase up to 16,138 shares of common stock, issued on July 20, 2022 and amended in April 2023 and August 2023 (the “July 2022 Warrants”); (iii) warrants to purchase up\nto 82,668 shares of common stock, issued on April 10, 2023 and August 2023 (the “April and August 2023 Warrants”, and collectively with the December 2022 Warrants and\nJuly 2022 Warrants, the “December 2022 Through August 2023 Warrants”); and (iv) warrants to purchase up to 242,915 shares of common stock underlying the August 2023\nCommon Warrants (collectively, the “Existing Common Warrants”). Pursuant to the Warrant Amendment Agreement, the Existing Common Warrants will be amended (the\n“Warrant Amendment”) such that they will not be exercisable until the company obtains stockholder approval for the issuance of up to 477,058 shares of common stock upon\nexercise of the Existing Common Warrants (the “Existing Common Warrant Shares”). The Existing Common Warrants will have an exercise price equal to $3.23 per share, and\nthe Existing Common Warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of the Stockholder Approval Date (the “Repricing and Extension”). The other terms of the Existing Common\nWarrants remain unchanged.\nThe closing of the transactions discussed above occurred on December 1, 2023 (the “Closing Date”). Upon the closing of the transactions, the Company regained\ncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d).\nFor purposes of obtaining Stockholder Approval of the issuance of the Warrant Shares and the Existing Common Warrant Shares, the Company has agreed to hold a\nStockholder Meeting (as defined in the November 2023 SPA Amendment) on or prior to the date that is ninety (90) days following the Closing Date (and has scheduled such\nmeeting for February 16, 2024). If the Company does not obtain Stockholder Approval at the first Stockholder Meeting, the Company will call a Stockholder Meeting every\nninety (90) days thereafter until the earlier of: (i) the date on which Stockholder Approval is obtained or (ii) the Warrants and the Existing Common Warrants are no longer\noutstanding.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the transactions, the Company entered into a warrant agent agreement (the “Warrant Agent Agreement”) with Continental Stock\nTransfer & Trust Company (“Continental”), pursuant to which Continental will act as warrant agent with respect to the Warrants.\n27\nAs a result of those transactions, on December 14, 2023, Nasdaq provided the Company written notice that the Company has complied with the terms of the prior\nextension; that the Company complies with Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)); and that the matter is now closed.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity\nrequirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Rule”) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to\nmaintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000. In the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a\nstockholders’ deficit of ($149,327), which is below the minimum stockholders’ equity required for continued listing pursuant to the Rule. Additionally, the Company does not\nmeet the alternative Nasdaq continued listing standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nNasdaq provided the Company until January 2, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance. We submitted the plan to regain compliance in a timely manner,\nand on January 11, 2024, Nasdaq advised the Company that it has determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with the Rule.\nThe terms of the extension are as follows: on or before May 13, 2024, the Company must complete certain transactions described in greater detail in the compliance\nplan, contemplated to result in the Company increasing its stockholders’ equity to more than $2.5 million, and opt for one of the two following alternatives to evidence\ncompliance with the Rule: Alternative 1: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available report (e.g., a Form 8-K) including: 1. A disclosure of Staff’s\ndeficiency letter and the specific deficiency(ies) cited; 2. A description of the completed transaction or event that enabled the Company to satisfy the stockholders’ equity\nrequirement for continued listing; and 3. An affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, the Company believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders’\nequity requirement based upon the specific transaction or event referenced in Step 2; or Alternative 2: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available\nreport including: 1. Steps 1 & 2 set forth above; 2. A balance sheet no older than 60 days with pro forma adjustments for any significant transactions or event occurring on or\nbefore the report date; and 3. That the Company believes it satisfies the stockholders’ equity requirement as of the report date. The pro forma balance sheet must evidence\ncompliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement.\nAdditionally, in either case the Company is required to disclose that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company’s ongoing compliance with the stockholders’ equity\nrequirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting.\nRegardless of which alternative the Company chooses, if the Company fails to evidence compliance upon filing its next periodic report with the SEC following the end\nof such compliance period (i.e., its Quarterly Report for the Quarter ended June 30, 2024), the Company may be subject to delisting. In the event the Company does not satisfy\nthese terms, Nasdaq will provide written notification that its securities will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal Nasdaq’s determination to a Hearings Panel.\nThe Company is currently evaluating various courses of action to regain compliance and is hopeful that it can regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum\nstockholders’ equity standard within the compliance period. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the transactions contemplated in the\ncompliance plan, which the Company expects will allow it to regain compliance with the Rule, or that such transactions will result in the Company regaining compliance with\nthe Rule, within the compliance period granted by Nasdaq, if at all. If we fail to timely remedy our compliance with such applicable requirement, our common stock and Public\nWarrants may be delisted.\nEffective on December 17, 2023, Donald A. McGovern, Jr., resigned as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company. Mr. McGovern’s resignation was due to\nhealth reasons. Effective on December 17, 2023, Francis Knuettel II, Pam Marrone, Teresa DeLuca, Larry Gold, and Russell Ray, resigned as members of the Board of\nDirectors of the Company; their resignations were in connection with a difference of opinion on cost cutting initiatives.\nMr. McGovern, Mr. Knuettel, Dr. DeLuca, Dr. Gold and Mr. Ray, represented all of our independent directors and as such, as of December 17, 2023, we have no\nindependent directors, nor any members of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and Risk, Safety and\nRegulatory Committee. We are currently seeking qualified individuals to appoint as independent members of the Board of Directors; see Note 13 – Subsequent Events, New\nBoard Members Appointed and Resignation of Board.\n28\nDue to recent financial constraints, the Company has been unable to timely pay amounts due to the University of Oxford, the licensor of the majority of the Company’s\nlicenses and patents and the Company’s research partner. Oxford alleges that an aggregate of approximately £929,030 is owed from the Company and one of its subsidiaries to\nOxford under the terms of licenses and agreements with Oxford and related parties. The Company is currently in ongoing discussion with Oxford to reduce that amount and\nenter into a payment plan with regards to the amounts owed, and has received preliminary acceptance of a payment plan; however, no definitive terms or extensions have been\nagreed to date. Oxford has also notified the Company that it is not willing to discuss any new projects or arrangements until all outstanding invoices have been paid or a\npayment plan has been agreed to; has engaged a law firm to seek the collection of the amounts owed, together with interest; and has threatened legal proceedings against us.\nWhile we are hopeful that we can come to mutually agreeable terms regarding a settlement, payment plan, and/or extension, with Oxford, we may not have sufficient funds to\npay amounts due to Oxford in the near term, if at all, and Oxford may take action against us, including filing legal proceedings against us seeking amounts due and interest,\nattempting to terminate their relationship with us, and/or filing a wind-up petition against one of the Company’s subsidiaries in the U.K. If Oxford were to take legal action\nagainst us or terminate their relationship with us, we may be forced to scale back our business plan and/or seek bankruptcy protection. We may be subject to litigation and\ndamages for our failure to pay amounts due to Oxford, and may be forced to pay interest and penalties, which funds we do not currently have. We plan to seek to raise funding\nin the future to support our operations, and to pay amounts due to Oxford, through a combination of equity offerings, debt financing or other capital sources, including\npotentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if\naccomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. Additionally, in December 2023, we engaged A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners as financial advisor to explore and\nevaluate strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include,\nbut are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, other business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic transactions involving the Company. The\nCompany does not intend to discuss or disclose further developments during this process unless and until its Board of Directors has approved a specific action or otherwise\ndetermined that further disclosure is appropriate. There is no assurance that the strategic review process will result in the approval or completion of any specific transaction or\noutcome.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in significant part on our ability to protect the proprietary elements of our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without\ninfringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to defend challenges and oppositions from others and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. We have\nsought, and will continue to seek, patent protection in the U.S., U.K., Europe and other countries for our proprietary technologies.\nOur intellectual property portfolio as of March 20, 2024, includes eleven patent families with issued and/or pending claims, pharmaceutical formulations, drug\ndelivery and the therapeutic uses of SCAs, as well as know-how and trade secrets, when including patents held by our partners of which we have exclusive rights.\nWithin the U.S., we and/or our partners have or have licensed fourteen issued patents and nine pending patent applications under active prosecution. Outside of the\nU.S., assuming the EU as a single jurisdiction, there are an additional fifteen issued patents and thirteen pending patent applications under active prosecution.\nOur policy is to seek patent protection for the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in\nthose cases where we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the technology, and typically only in those jurisdictions that\nwe believe present significant commercial opportunities. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our\ncompetitive position.\nThe term of individual patents depends upon the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we have filed, the patent term is 20 years from the\nearliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for\nadministrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.\n29\nThe term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for extension, which permits term restoration as compensation for the term lost during the\nFDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits an extension of up to five years beyond\nthe expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Extensions cannot extend the remaining\nterm of a patent beyond 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions to extend the term\nof a patent that covers an approved drug are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nTo protect our rights to any of our issued patents and proprietary information, we may need to litigate against infringing third parties, avail ourselves of the courts or\nparticipate in hearings to determine the scope and validity of those patents or other proprietary rights.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Our policy requires our employees, consultants, outside scientific\ncollaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of our operations, we will be a party to litigation and other dispute matters and claims relating to intellectual property.\n180LS’ Research, Development and License Agreements\n180LS has entered into research and licensing agreements with various parties, including the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Oxford. For information regarding\nthese agreements, see “Material Agreements”, above.\nCompetition\nBelow is a description of the competitive environment of each of our product candidate development platforms and potential product candidates.\nDupuytren’s Contracture\nOur treatment is for early-stage Dupuytren’s Contracture, for which, to our knowledge, there is no approved treatment. Existing treatments focus on late stage\nDupuytren’s Contracture, when the fingers are irreversibly curled into the palm. Surgery remains the typical standard treatment, but the relatively long post-operative\nrehabilitation has driven the reach for less invasive techniques. Xiaflex, a drug developed by Auxilium, has shown effective in treating patients with developed contractures\nalthough many patients experience relatively mild side effects. An alternative approach is disruption of the late-stage cords with a needle and data from a comparative clinical\ntrial published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (American) in 2018 showed similar recurrence rates between collagenase and percutaneous needle fasciotomy at 2\nyears. A clinical trial funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (U.K.) is currently underway in the U.K., comparing the\ncost efficacy of surgery for Dupuytren’s Contracture with collagenase treatment. The aims of the study are to determine (i) whether collagenase injections are as effective and as\nsafe as surgery for treating this condition and (ii) the costs of both treatments.\nSCAs\nFollowing the acquisition of GW Pharmaceuticals PLC and its Epidiolex (cannabidiol) and Sativex (THC & CBD) franchises, by Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Ireland), Jazz\nPharma has become the prominent player in the cannabidiol space. Epidiolex is an oral cannabidiol solution approved for treating seizures in a range of childhood epileptic\ndiseases, including Dravet’s syndrome (formerly known as severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy), Rett Syndrome, and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. Jazz Pharma is exploring\nwhether Epidiolex is effective in Sturge-Weber Syndrome, in which abnormal development of blood vessels leads to defects in the brain, skin, and eyes from birth, and more\nbroadly in Autism Spectrum Disorder. Clinical trials sponsored by Jazz Pharma testing effectiveness of Epidiolex in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, ulcerative\ncolitis, and Crohn’s Disease are ongoing. Collectively, these efforts represent the most extensive cannabidiol clinical program.\n30\nTo our knowledge, multiple companies are working in the cannabis therapeutic area and are pursuing regulatory approval for their product candidates, including:\n● Cardiol Therapeutics (Canada) which is evaluating the effectiveness of their oral CBD liquid formulation on myocardial recovery in patients presenting with acute\nmyocarditis.\n● Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (Pennsylvania) which focuses on pharmaceutically produced transdermal cannabinoid therapies for rare and near-rare neuropsychiatric\ndisorders. Zynerba currently is evaluating ZygelTM, a patent-protected transdermal CBD gel for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome, for which it filed an NDA\nwith the FDA, developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, 22q deletion syndrome, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n● Orcosa, (New Jersey) which is testing their CBD, Oravexx (oral disintegrating tablets), to manage pain and inflammation with the hope of reducing clinical\nreliance on opioids. The particular indication is pain associated with osteoarthritis in the knee in a Phase 2 trial.\n● Stero Biotechs (Israel) which sponsored a phase II trial in GVHD demonstrating that CBD administration (synthetic CBD in olive oil), either enhanced the\ntherapeutic effect of steroids or reduced the steroid dosage while maintaining or improving the steroid’s original therapeutic effect. Additional clinical trials are a\nPhase Iia, multi centered trial in steroid dependent Crohn’s disease, a Phase Iia trial in chronic urticaia (Hives), and Phase I/II trial in severe Covid-19.\nA7nAChR\nAntibodies selective for TNFa (Humira) or TNFa receptor (Remicade) and nucleic acid aptamers are injectable reagents, which by their inherent nature have clinical\nlimitations. An orally bioavailable inhibitor of TNFa is a natural complementary reagent to the antibody or aptamer strategy. This is particularly attractive if the mode of action\ndiffers between the varying therapeutic reagents. The antibodies and aptamers both are designed to interfere with TNFa signaling, whereas the orally bioavailable drug is an α7\nnicotinic acetyl choline receptor agonist known to activate the vagus nerve and the brain- immune system interface.\nThe 180LS program to develop an orally bioavailable inhibitor of TNFa secretion has significant competition. The most prominent is the collection of Jak inhibitors\n(Xeljanz, Cibinqo, Olumiant, Rinvoq and Jyseleca) approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis,\nulcerative colitis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. The mode of action is the inhibition of the Jak-Stat pathway principally in cells of the macrophage lineages known to\nsecrete a variety of proinflammatory cytokines including TNFa. The commercial success of these reagents provides practical support for the importance of developing an orally\nbioavailable product. These drugs are not involved in acetylcholine receptor pathway. Attenua Pharma, a small biotechnology that was using an α7nAChR agonist, bradanicline,\nin Phase 2 clinical trials for chronic cough was acquired by Coda therapeutics and this program has been discontinued.\nThe electroceutical companies can be viewed as competition, or a vast proof-of-concept. Because in many respects, the α7nAChR program can be considered as a\nchemical stimulation of the vagus nerve, and each of the indications benefiting from electrical stimulation, should be amenable to chemical stimulation. To our knowledge, the\ncompany closest to an approved product for inflammatory indications is SetPoint Medical Corporation, which has active for inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid\narthritis. Their device is a miniaturized stimulator implant, which is surgically placed under general anesthesia on the vagus nerve through a small incision on the left side of the\nneck. An unexpected result is that a short electrical pulse leads to an extended period of reduction of inflammatory cytokines, of the order of 8-10 hours.\nA final consideration is that each of the large pharmaceutical companies that initially developed α7nAChR agonists could revitalize their programs and use their drugs\nin clinical trials for inflammatory indications.\nThe electroceutical companies can be viewed as competition, or a vast proof-of-concept. Because in many respects, the α7nAChR program can be viewed as a\nchemical stimulation of the vagus nerve, and each of the indications benefiting from electrical stimulation, should be amenable to chemical stimulation.\n31\nLastly, each of the large pharmaceutical companies that initially developed α7nAChR agonists could revitalize their programs and use their drugs in clinical trials for\ninflammatory indications.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe have obtained regulatory approvals from the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Dutch Centrale Commissie\nMensgebonden Onderzoek (CCMO), as well as from the relevant accredited ethics committees, in order to perform clinical trials in the U.K. and The Netherlands solely for\nindications under the anti-TNF platform. Following the successful results of the Phase 2b Dupuytren’s Contracture clinical trial, we are preparing a conditional marketing\nauthorization application to be filed with the MHRA. We have not held any meetings with, and no applications or requests for approval have been submitted to, the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (“FDA”) for any indications or products under the anti-TNF platform at this time.\nFDA Approval Process\nIn the U.S., pharmaceutical products, including drugs and biologics, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic\nAct (the “FDC Act”), a “drug” is defined to include “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals”\nand “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.” 21 USC 321(g). Like all drugs, biological products are also\nused for the treatment, prevention or cure of disease in humans. However, in contrast to chemically synthesized small molecular weight drugs, which have a well-defined\nstructure and can be thoroughly characterized, biological products are generally derived from living material, such as human, animal, or microorganism, are complex in\nstructure, and thus are always fully characterized. The U.S. Public Health Servicer Act (the “PHS Act”) defines a biological product as a “virus, therapeutic serum, toxin,\nantitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product … applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition\nof human beings.” 42 USC 262(i). FDA regulations and policies have established that biological products include blood-derived products, vaccines, in vivo diagnostic\nallergenic products, immunoglobulin products, products containing cells or microorganisms, and most protein products. Biological products subject to the PHS Act also meet\nthe definition of drugs under the FDC Act. Biological products are a subset of drugs, and therefore both are regulated under provisions of the FDC Act. However, only\nbiological products are licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act, although some therapeutic protein products have been approved under section 505 of the FDC Act rather\nthan the PHS Act.\nThe FDC Act, PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage,\nrecordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drugs and biologics.\nFailure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, FDA\nrefusal to approve pending NDAs or the FDA’s Biologics License Application (BLAs) or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, withdrawal of approvals, warning letters,\nproduct recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nDrug and biologic development in the U.S. typically involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become\neffective before clinical testing may commence. For commercial approval, the sponsor must submit adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show that the\ndrug/biologic is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling. The sponsor must also submit substantial evidence, generally\nconsisting of adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish that the drug/biologic will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use\nprescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labeling, including meeting FDA standards for safety, and efficacy for drugs or purity and potency for biologics.\nSatisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and\nnovelty of the product candidate or disease.\n32\nPre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product candidate chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and\npotential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including FDA’s Good\nLaboratory Practice (“GLP”), Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), and Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (“GMP”) regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s\nregulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act of 1996. The results of pre-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including\ninformation about product candidate chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of\nreproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.\nA 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not imposed a clinical\nhold on the IND or otherwise commented or questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND is deemed issued, and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug/biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator.\nClinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with GCP, an international standard and U.S. legal requirement meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to\ndefine the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, (ii) in compliance with other federal regulations, and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the\ntrial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol\namendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.\nThe FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not\nbeing conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for\npatients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), for approval. An IRB may also prevent a clinical trial from beginning or require the\nclinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions.\nClinical trials to support NDAs/BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or otherwise vary in\nparticular circumstances. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug/biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug/biologic is tested to assess metabolism,\npharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a\nlimited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug/biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse\neffects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain\nthe additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to\nevaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug/biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug/biologic. In most cases, the FDA requires two\nadequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug/biologic. The FDA may, however, determine that a single Phase 3 trial with other\nconfirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances. In some cases, the FDA may require post-market studies, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted as a condition\nof approval in order to gather additional information on the drug’s/biologic’s effect in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use. Depending on the\nrisks posed by the drugs/biologics, other post-market requirements may be imposed.\nIn response to specific requirements set forth in the 21st Century Cures Act to address the need for greater patient participation in drug development and evaluation,\nthe FDA has issued its Plan for Issuances of Focused Drug Development Guidance, pursuant to which the FDA will issue a series of guidances intended to address, in a\nstepwise manner, how stakeholders can collect and submit patient experience data and other relevant information from patients and caregivers for medical product development\nand regulatory decision making. The guidances are expected to facilitate the advancement and use of systematic approaches to collect and use robust and meaningful patient\nand caregiver input that can better inform medical product development and regulatory decision making. To date, the FDA has issued three of the planned four guidances on\nthese issues. We expect the issue of patient-centric drug development and evaluation to increase in priority and be more of a factor in clinical trial design, moving forward.\nAfter completion of the required clinical testing, a New Drug Application (“NDA”)/BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA approval of the NDA/BLA is\nrequired before marketing of the product candidate may begin in the U.S. The NDA/BLA must include the results of all pre-clinical, clinical, and other testing and a\ncompilation of data relating to the product candidate’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA/BLA is substantial.\nUnder federal law, the submission of most NDAs/BLAs is also subject to an application user fee, which, for the fiscal year 2023, is in the amount of approximately $4.0 million\n(where clinical data is required).\n33\nThe FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA/BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination\nthat it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. Under the Prescription Drug User\nFee Act, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs/BLAs. The FDA’s current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90\npercent of standard (non-priority) NDAs/BLAs within 10 months of receipt and within six months for priority NDAs/BLAs, but two additional months are added to standard\nand priority NDAs/BLAs for a new molecular entity/reference biologic. A drug/biologic is eligible for priority review if it addresses an unmet medical need in a serious or life-\nthreatening disease or condition. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-\nsubmitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. These timelines are not legally binding on the FDA.\nThe FDA may also refer applications for novel drug/biologic products, or drug/biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory\ncommittee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved.\nThe FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA/BLA, the FDA will\ntypically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.\nAdditionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless compliance\nwith GMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA/BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective, or the biologic meets the standards for safety,\npurity, and potency in the indication studied.\nAfter the FDA evaluates the NDA/BLA and the manufacturing facilities, the FDA issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response\nletter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If,\nor when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA/BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to\nreviewing 90 percent of resubmissions within two or six months depending on the type of information included. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional\ninformation, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\nAn approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug/biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA/BLA\napproval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug/biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS\ncan include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to,\nspecial training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement\nfor a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug/biologic. Moreover, product candidate approval may require substantial post approval testing\nand surveillance to monitor the drug’s/biologic’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product candidate approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not\nmaintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.\nDuring the declaration of the COVID public health emergency, the FDA has been exercising enforcement discretion with respect to certain classes of products and has\nprovided for the issuance of Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) which have enabled a number of products to enter the market without formal conventional FDA clearance\nor approval, and has also drawn FDA resources away from non-COVID related products. The U.S. government has since declared the termination of the public health\nemergency effective May 11, 2023.\n34\nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information\nSponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs/biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial\ninformation on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product candidate, patient population, phase of investigation,\nstudy sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these trials after\ncompletion. The deadline for submitting the results of these trials can be extended for up to two years if the sponsor certifies that it is seeking approval of an unapproved\nproduct or that it will file an application for approval of a new indication for an approved product within one year. Competitors may use the publicly available information to\ngain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.\nFast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval\nIf our drug/biologic candidate meets the requirements of the FDA’s fast track program, we would seek to have our drug/biologic candidate expedited through this\nprogram. The FDA has programs to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs/biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening\ndisease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast-track\nprogram, the sponsor of a new drug/biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug/biologic candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug/biologic\nconcurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug/biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug/biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within\n60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. In addition to other benefits such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of\nsections of a fast track drug’s/biologic’s NDA/BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a\nschedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does\nnot begin until the last section of the NDA/BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if it believes that the designation is no\nlonger supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.\nUnder the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug/biologic for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic\nbenefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured\nearlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account\nthe severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.\nIn clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a\npatient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug/biologic candidate approved on this\nbasis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. Failure to\nconduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug/biologic from the market on an\nexpedited basis. Unless otherwise informed by the FDA, for an accelerated approval product/biologic, an applicant must submit to the FDA for consideration during the\npreapproval review period copies of all promotional materials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, intended for dissemination or publication within 120\ndays following marketing approval. After 120 days following marketing approval, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the applicant must submit promotional materials at\nleast 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the labeling or initial publication of the advertisement.\nBreakthrough Therapy Designation\nAs with the FDA’s fast track program, if our drug/biologic candidate meets the requirements to receive the FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation, we would seek\nto have our drug/biologic candidate expedited through this program. The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy designation program is intended to expedite the development and review\nof products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A Breakthrough Therapy is defined, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act,\nas a drug/biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs/biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary\nclinical evidence indicates that the drug/biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as\nsubstantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of fast-track designation, as well as more intensive FDA\ninteraction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the\nsame product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the\ndevelopment and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt,\nand the FDA will either grant or deny the request.\n35\nIn addition, the 21st Century Cures Act created the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation. RMAT applies to regenerative medicines as a\nclass. Sponsors of certain cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and certain combination products may obtain the RMAT\ndesignation for their drug product if the drug is intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and if there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the\ndrug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for that disease or condition. Sponsors may make such a request with or after submission of an investigational new drug\napplication.\nSponsors of RMAT-designated products are eligible for increased and earlier interactions with the FDA, similar to those interactions available to sponsors of\nbreakthrough-designated therapies. In addition, they may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. The meetings with sponsors of RMAT-designated products\nmay include discussions of whether accelerated approval would be appropriate based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical\nbenefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites.\nOnce approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical\nevidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence such as electronic health records; through the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or\nthrough post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.\nFast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the\ndevelopment or approval process. Even if the FDA grants one of these designations, the FDA may later decide that the drug/biologic products no longer meet the conditions for\nqualification.\nOrange Book Listing and Patent Certification\nBased on amendments to the FDC Act made by the Drug Price Competition and Innovation Act of 1984 (commonly known as Hatch-Waxman), in seeking approval\nfor a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product candidate or a claimed method of use of the\nproduct candidate. Upon approval of a drug, each of the eligible patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book must, in turn, be the subject of a special certification by the filer\nof an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), for a generic version of the drug, or by the applicant of a hybrid application known as a 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA\nprovides for marketing of a drug product candidate that has the same active ingredient(s) in the same strengths and dosage form as the reference listed innovator drug and has\nbeen shown to be bioequivalent to the reference listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing (absent a waiver), ANDA applicants are not required to\nconduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product candidate. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred\nto as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, are considered therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions\nwritten for the original listed drug.\nThe ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product candidate in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the\napplicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a\nparticular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product candidate. The ANDA applicant may\nalso elect to submit a “section viii statement”, certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of- use,\nrather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.\nIf the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have\nexpired.\n36\nA certification that the new product candidate will not infringe the already approved product candidate’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid or\nunenforceable, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the\nParagraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent\ninfringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of notice of a Paragraph\nIV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, a decision in the\ninfringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant, or some other order of the court.\nSponsors may also seek to market versions of drug products via a section 505(b)(2) application, which is an NDA pathway that allows an applicant to seek approval\nfor a drug product based on full safety and efficacy documentation, some of which may be from literature or conducted by others and for which the applicant does not have the\nright of reference. NDA Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a modification, such as a new indication or new dosage form, of a\npreviously approved drug. Section 505(b)(2) applications may rely on the FDA’s previous findings for the safety and effectiveness of the previously approved drug in addition\nto information obtained by the 505(b)(2) applicant to support the modification of the previously approved drug. Preparing Section 505(b)(2) applications may be less costly and\ntime-consuming than preparing an NDA based entirely on new data and information. Section 505(b)(2) applications are subject to the same patent certification procedures as an\nANDA.\nNew Chemical Entity Exclusivity and Clinical Investigation Exclusivity\nUpon NDA approval of a new chemical entity (“NCE”), which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug\nreceives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application seeking approval of a drug that references a version\nof the NCE drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert with new clinical studies required for approval, are associated with a\nthree-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that includes the change.\nAn ANDA or 505(b)(2) application may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the\nOrange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification and thus no ANDA or 505(b)(2) may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.\nFor a botanical drug, the FDA may determine that the active moiety is one or more of the principle components or the complex mixture as a whole. This determination\nwould affect the utility of any five-year exclusivity as well as the ability of any potential generic competitor to demonstrate that it is the same drug as the original botanical\ndrug.\nFive-year and three-year exclusivities do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) application for a version of the drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that\nthe 505(b)(1) conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and\neffectiveness.\nOrphan Designation and Exclusivity\nThe FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects\nmore than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be\nrecovered from sales in the U.S.\nOrphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee\nwaivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or BLA\napplicant to receive orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market\nthe same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the U.S., except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from\napproving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.\n37\nPediatric Studies and Exclusivity\nNDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric\npopulations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the\nrequest of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria\nare met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase 2 meeting and\nsubmission of the NDA or BLA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan\ndesignation has been granted.\nPediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the U.S. that may be granted if certain FDA requirements are met, such as the FDA’s determination\nthat information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits, and the applicant agrees to perform and report on FDA-requested\nstudies within a certain time frame. Pediatric exclusivity adds a period of six months of exclusivity to the end of all existing marketing exclusivity and patents held by the\nsponsor for that active moiety. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another\napplication relying on the NDA or BLA sponsor’s data.\nBiologics Exclusivity and Biosimilars\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009,\nor BPCI Act, which amended the PHS Act to create an abbreviated approval pathway under section 351(k) of the PHS Act for biological products shown to be similar to, or\ninterchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product originally licensed under section 351(a) of the PHS Act.\nA reference biologic is granted twelve years of marketing exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, during which time a 351(k) application\nfor a biosimilar of the reference product may not be approved. The reference biologic is also granted four years of so-called data exclusivity, during which time a\n351(k) application for a biosimilar of the reference product may not be submitted for review. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that\nis determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of\n(i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant’s\nfavor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing\nwithin the 42-month period.\nBiologic Patent Information\nIn contrast to small molecule drugs, for which applicants are required to submit patent information with their NDAs and certain supplements, an applicant seeking\nlicensure of a biological product need not submit patent information in its BLA or supplements. Also, unlike small molecule drugs, for which the approvability of ANDAs and\n505(b)(2) NDAs is impacted by the status of listed patents for the reference NDA drug product, the approvability of section 351(k) applications for biosimilar products is\npresently delinked from the various processes for resolving patent disputes. Biosimilar applicants have a choice whether to engage in the patent litigation provisions of the\nBiologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), colloquially known as the “patent dance,” to identify and litigate a defined list of patents. However, unlike the listing\nof small molecule reference listed drugs and patents in the “Orange Book,” there had not been a process for listing patents in the FDA’s List of Licensed Biological Products,\ncommonly known as the “Purple Book.” However, in December 2020 Congress enacted the Biological Product Patent Transparency Act (“BPPT”) (originally introduced as the\nPurple Book Continuity Act created section 351(k)(9) of the PHS Act). That section requires that a biological product reference sponsor that provides a biosimilar applicant\nwith a patent list as part of the “Patent Dance” BPCIA patent litigation process must now submit those lists to the FDA within 30 days, and further, as of June 2021 the FDA is\nrequired to make those lists (along with any revisions or updates) public in the Purple Book database.\n38\nPatent Term Extension\nAfter NDA or BLA approval, owners of relevant drug or biologic patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is\ncalculated as half of the product’s testing phase - the time between IND submission and NDA or BLA submission - and all of the review phase - the time between NDA\nsubmission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The\ntotal patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.\nFor patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent\nterm by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the\nUSPTO must determine that approval of the product covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for\na drug for which an NDA or BLA has not been submitted.\nAdvertising and Promotion\nOnce an NDA or BLA is approved, a product candidate will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval\nmarketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and\neducational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.\nDrugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.\nPost-Approval Changes\nChanges to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require\nsubmission and FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically\nrequires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing\nNDAs.\nAdverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance\nAdverse event reporting on an expedited basis and submission of periodic adverse event reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also\nmay require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an\napproval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform\nGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration\nwith the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMPs.\nAccordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMPs. Regulatory\nauthorities may withdraw product approvals, issue warning letters, request product recalls or take other enforcement actions if a company fails to comply with regulatory\nstandards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.\nSpecial Protocol Assessment\nA sponsor may reach an agreement with the FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended\nto form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. According to its performance goals, the FDA has committed to evaluating 90 percent of the protocols within 45 days of its\nreceipt of the requests to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. An SPA request\nmust be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made\npart of the administrative record. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA as to the design of\nthe trial except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the study begins, public\nhealth concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the study sponsor fails to\nfollow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA.\n39\nControlled Substances\nThe Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, as amended (“CSA”) and the implementing regulations impose registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting,\nstorage, manufacturing, distribution, dispensing, importation and other requirements on controlled substances under the oversight of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\n(“DEA”). The DEA is the federal agency, responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute,\nresearch, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion and abuse of controlled substances.\nThe DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, depending on the substance’s medical effectiveness and abuse potential.\nPharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule\nII substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse\nand dependence. The DEA has placed certain drug products that include cannabidiol, on Schedule V.\nFollowing NDA approval of a drug containing a Schedule I controlled substance, that substance must be rescheduled as a Schedule II, III, IV or V substance before it\ncan be marketed. The Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act enacted on November 25, 2015 and its implementing regulations has removed\nuncertainty associated with the timing of the DEA rescheduling process after NDA approval, under which a manufacturer may market its product no later than 90 days after the\nlater of: (1) the date on which the DEA receives from the FDA the scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation; or (2) the date on which the DEA receives\nfrom the FDA notification that the FDA has approved the drug. The Act also clarifies that the seven-year orphan exclusivity period begins with the approval of the NDA or\nDEA scheduling, whichever is later. This changes the previous situation whereby the orphan “clock” began to tick upon the FDA’s NDA approval, even though the product\ncould not be marketed until DEA scheduling was complete.\nThe CSA requires that facilities that manufacture, distribute, dispense, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. Separate\nregistrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes the specific schedules of controlled substances the registrant may\nhandle. Prior to issuance of a controlled substance registration, the DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling of the\ncontrolled substances. The specific security requirements vary by, among other things, the type of business activity conducted, and the type, form, and quantity of controlled\nsubstances handled.\nIn addition, individual states have their own distinct controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensure, distribution, dispensing, recordkeeping and\nreporting requirements for controlled substances. State boards of pharmacy or similar authorities regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to comply with\napplicable requirements, such as the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in administrative fines, suspension or revocation of licenses, and civil and criminal\nliabilities.\nU.K./Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S., we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions\ngoverning, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales (including pricing and reimbursement) and distribution of our products, if approved.\nWhether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the\ncommencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries.\n40\nIn the EU, medicinal products are subject to extensive pre- and post-marketing regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels. Additional rules\nalso apply at the national level to the manufacture, import, export, storage, distribution and sale of controlled substances. In many EU member states the regulatory authority\nresponsible for medicinal products is also responsible for controlled substances. Responsibility is, however, split in some member states. Generally, any company\nmanufacturing or distributing a medicinal product containing a controlled substance in the EU will need to hold a controlled substances license from the competent national\nauthority and will be subject to specific record-keeping and security obligations. Separate import or export certificates are required for each shipment into or out of the member\nstate.\nIn the U.K., medicinal products are subject to extensive regulation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), which is an executive\nagency, sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Care. MHRA regulates by ensuring that medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion meet\napplicable standards of safety, quality and efficacy, in addition to supporting innovation and research and development that is beneficial to public health.\nClinical Trials and Marketing Approval\nCertain countries outside of the U.S. have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human\nclinical trials. In the European Union/European Economic Area (“EEA”), for example, a clinical trial application (a “CTA”), must be submitted via a single-entry portal for all\nclinical trials conducted in the EU/EEA (the “CTIS”). Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements and a company has received favorable ethics\ncommittee approval, clinical trial development may proceed in that country.\nIn April 2014, the Clinical Trials Regulation, Reg. (EU) No 536/2014 (the “New Regulation”) was adopted to replace the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the\n“Prior Directive”). To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the EU/EEA, new EU clinical trials legislation was passed as a “regulation” that is directly\napplicable to EU/EEA member states. The New Regulation requires the sponsor to submit a single CTA is planned for all EU/EEA member states, which will be submitted via\nthe CTIS, an online portal to streamline the authorization process. The CTIS authorization procedure is composed of two parts: member states jointly cooperate in a Part I\nassessment, while Part II is assessed by each member state individually. This is a significant change, as under the Prior Directive sponsors had to seek separate approval from\nnational authorities in each country where the trial was to be conducted. The New Regulation became applicable on January 31, 2022 - repealing the Prior Directive as of the\nsame day - and introduced a one-year transition period (until January 31, 2023) during which sponsors could choose whether to submit new CTAs under either the old regime\ngoverned by the Prior Directive or the new CTIS. Following the transition period, from January 31, 2023, sponsors must apply for clinical trials under the New Regulation, and\nby January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials approved under the Prior Directive will need to be transitioned to the New Regulation.\nIn the U.K., the Prior Directive (implemented by Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004/1031) still applies. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. left\nthe EU and the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”) came into force. Section 1 of the EUWA repealed the European Communities Act 1972 (ECA 1972),\nwhich had previously enabled EU law to apply to the U.K. However, Section 1A of the EUWA immediately saved much of the effect of ECA 1972 (in modified form) for the\nduration of the transition period, and Section 1B saved U.K. legislation that implemented EU requirements. The practical effect of the EUWA was therefore that the New\nRegulation, which had not yet become applicable was repealed for the U.K., but the Prior Directive was retained. References to the U.K. in this section predominantly refer to\nGreat Britain. Due to the Northern Ireland Protocol at Article 182 of the EUWA certain EU/EEA derived regulatory standards in Northern Ireland were not repealed and\ntherefore in some circumstances still apply. The Northern Ireland Protocol was replaced with the Windsor Framework in 2023. In the U.K., approval must be obtained from the\nMHRA when a clinical trial is planned. A CTA must be submitted and supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier along with additional supporting information\npursuant to the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004/1031 and other applicable guidance documents provided by the MHRA. Furthermore, a clinical\ntrial may only commence after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in the U.K.\nThe requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is\nalready some degree of legal harmonization in the EU member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying EU legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials\nmust be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines on GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.\n41\nTo obtain regulatory approval to place a drug on the market in the U.K. or EU/EEA countries, we must submit a marketing authorization application. This application\nis similar to the NDA in the U.S., with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. All application procedures require an application in the\ncommon technical document, format, which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and nonclinical and clinical\ntrial information. In addition to using national authorization procedures (leading to a marketing authorization on valid in the relevant EU/EEA member state), drugs can be\nauthorized in the EU/EEA by using (i) the centralized authorization procedure, (ii) the mutual recognition procedure, or (iii) the decentralized procedure. These three\nauthorization methods available to the EU/EEA are no longer available to the U.K. Drugs can be authorized in the U.K. by the MHRA by using (i) the Innovative Licensing and\nAccess Pathway, (ii) the 150-day assessment route, (iii) a “rolling review” route of evaluation for novel products and biotechnological products, (iv) a European Commission\n(EC) Decision reliance procedure, (v) a decentralized and mutual recognition reliance procedure, or (vi) an “unfettered access” route for marketing authorization applications\napproved in Northern Ireland.\nThe European Commission created the centralized procedure for the approval of human drugs to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU\nand, by extension (after national implementing decisions) in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which, together with the EU member states, comprise the European Economic\nArea. Applicants file marketing authorization applications with the European Medicines Agency (EMA), where they are reviewed by a relevant scientific committee, in most\ncases the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) forwards CHMP opinions to the European Commission,\nwhich uses them as the basis for deciding whether to grant a marketing authorization. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European\nCommission that is valid across the EU, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from\nbiotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes,\nneurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated “orphan drugs” (drugs used for rare human diseases) and\n(iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the voluntary request of the\napplicant also be used for human drugs that do not fall within the above-mentioned categories if the CHMP agrees that the human drug (a) contains a new active substance not\nyet approved on November 20, 2004; (b) constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or (c) authorization under the centralized procedure is in the\ninterests of patients at the EU level. Although the U.K. can no longer utilize the EU centralized procedure, until December 31, 2023, the MHRA can utilize the decentralized\nand mutual recognition reliance procedure to authorize drugs by relying upon EC approvals under the EU centralized procedure. Beyond December 31, 2023, the MHRA\nintends to have a new regime for an international drug reliance framework.\nUnder the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum time frame for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding\nclock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP), with adoption of the actual marketing\nauthorization by the European Commission thereafter.\nAccelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point\nof view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated; the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic\napproach, and anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150\ndays and the opinion issued thereafter.\nFor those medicinal products for which the centralized procedure is not available, the applicant must submit marketing authorization applications to the national\nmedicines regulators through one of three procedures: (i) the mutual recognition procedure (which must be used if the product has already been authorized in at least one other\nEU/EEA member state, and in which the EU/EEA member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the other EU/EEA member\nstate, unless they identify a serious risk to public health), (ii) the decentralized procedure (in which applications are submitted simultaneously in two or more EU/EEA member\nstates) or (iii) national authorization procedures (which results in a marketing authorization in a single EU/EEA member state).\n42\nConditional Marketing Authorization\nThe European Commission may grant a conditional marketing authorization to medicines that address unmet medical needs. This marketing authorization is\n“conditional” upon carrying out certain activities imposed when authorization is granted (e.g., completing ongoing or new studies or collecting additional data). This applies\nwhen the applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product under normal conditions of use, for objective, verifiable reasons\nand based on specific grounds, and all of the following criteria are met:\n● the benefit-risk balance of the medicine is positive;\n● it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data post-authorization;\n● the medicine fulfils an unmet medical need; and\n● the benefit of the medicine’s immediate availability to patients is greater than the risk inherent in the fact that additional data is still required.\nConditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually.\nIn Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) the MHRA has introduced and regulates a national conditional marketing authorization, effective from January 1, 2021; in\nNorthern Ireland, applications for conditional marketing authorization must be submitted to the EMA. The U.K. scheme has the same eligibility criteria as the EU scheme.\nMutual Recognition Procedure\nThe mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations\nwithin the EU/EEA. Basically, the MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of\nconventional medicinal products and must be used if the product has already been authorized in one or more member states.\nThe characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already-existing marketing authorization in a member state that is used as a reference in order to\nobtain marketing authorizations in other EU/EEA member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the EU/EEA\nand subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the\nmarketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as\nconcerned member states. The concerned member states are required to grant an authorization recognizing the existing authorization in the reference member state, unless they\nidentify a serious risk to public health.\nThe MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by EU/EEA member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing\nauthorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state is required\nto update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all concerned member states, together with\nthe approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference\nmember state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgment\nof the agreement.\nShould any member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the\nissue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this\nfails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the European Commission, for the\nstart of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing\nCommittee on Human Medicinal Products.\n43\nData Exclusivity\nIn the U.K. and EU, marketing authorization applications for generic medicinal products do not need to include the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials, but instead\ncan refer to the data included in the marketing authorization of a reference product for which regulatory data exclusivity has expired. If a marketing authorization is granted for\na medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications\nreferring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may\nnot be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over\nexisting therapies is approved.\nOrphan Medicinal Products\nThe EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”), may recommend orphan medicinal product designation to promote the development of products\nthat are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU.\nAdditionally, orphan designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic\ncondition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the product in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal\nproduct. The COMP may only recommend orphan medicinal product designation when the product in question offers a significant clinical benefit over existing approved\nproducts for the relevant indication. Following a positive opinion by the COMP, the European Commission generally grants orphan status within 30 days. When the draft\ndecision of the European Commission is not aligned with the COMP opinion, the COMP will reassess orphan status in parallel with EMA review of a marketing authorization\napplication and orphan status may be withdrawn if the drug no longer fulfills the orphan criteria (for instance, because a new product was approved for the indication and no\ndata is available to demonstrate a significant benefit over that new product). Orphan medicinal product designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of\nfees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing authorization. During this period, the competent authorities may not accept or approve\nany similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication, unless it offers a significant clinical benefit or if the holder of the marketing authorization for the original\norphan drug is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the drug. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan medicinal product designation criteria are no longer met,\nincluding where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.\nEU/EEA orphan designations extend to Northern Ireland. Otherwise in the U.K. post-Brexit, applications for the designation of orphan medicinal products are\nsubmitted to the MHRA, which applies the same substantive criteria and with the same substantive effect as in the EU (save that, unlike the EU procedure, it is not possible to\nobtain early orphan designation; the application for designation must be made at the same time as the application for the U.K. marketing authorization). If a medicinal product\nhas been designated orphan in the EU, then a Great Britain orphan marketing authorization application can be made to the MHRA; absent an EU orphan designation a U.K.-\nwide (including Northern Ireland) orphan marketing authorization application can be made to the MHRA.\nPediatric Development\nIn the EU and the U.K., companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”), with the EMA or the MHRA and must\nconduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP unless a waiver applies, for example, because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults. The marketing\nauthorization application for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been\ngranted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical\ntrials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if the product covered by it\nqualifies for one at the time of approval). This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP is\ndeveloped and submitted.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or\nwithdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\n44\nIn addition, most countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, which governs\ninternational trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates\na legal obstacle to our obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify\ntheir laws and regulations to permit our product candidates to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In\nthat case, we would be unable to market our products in those countries in the near future or perhaps at all.\nReimbursement\nSales of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payers, such as\ngovernment health programs, and commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for\nmedical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a\nfocus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including\nprice controls, utilization management and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more\nrestrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payers do not consider our future\nproducts to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of\npayment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), imposed requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs\nfor Medicare beneficiaries and included a major expansion of the prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in\nprescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D is available through both stand-alone prescription drug benefit\nplans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription\ndrug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at\nwhat tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily\nall the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee.\nGovernment payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices\nfor our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug\nbenefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment\nthat results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from nongovernmental payers.\nOn February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This law provides funding for the federal government\nto compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. This research is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare\nResearch and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures must be made to Congress. Although the\nresults of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear how such a result could be avoided and\nwhat if any effect the research will have on the sales of our product candidates, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also\npossible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. Decreases in third-\nparty reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidate\nand have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\n45\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) was\nenacted in March 2010. The ACA was enacted with the goal of expanding coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to\npharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and made changes to the coverage\nrequirements under the Medicare D program. We still cannot fully predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies as many of the ACA reforms require the\npromulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet been completed, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have publicly\nannounced that it is analyzing the ACA regulations and policies that have been issued to determine if changes should be made. In addition, although the U.S. Supreme Court has\nupheld the constitutionality of most of the ACA, some states have stated their intentions to not implement certain sections of the ACA and some members of Congress are still\nworking to repeal the ACA. These challenges add to the uncertainty of the changes enacted as part of the ACA. In addition, the current legal challenges to the ACA, as well as\nCongressional efforts to repeal the ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of the ACA.\nIn addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing\nvary widely from country to country. For example, some EU jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a\nreimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-\neffectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and\ncontrol company profits. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between EU member states. There can be no assurance that any country that\nhas price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically,\nproducts launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. In the EU, the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has\nbecome intense. As a result, barriers to entry of new products are becoming increasingly high and patients are unlikely to use a drug product that is not reimbursed by their\ngovernment or other public or private payers.\nOther Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements\nIn the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions\nof the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the\nDepartment of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse\nprovisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and similar state laws, each as\namended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care\nAct of 1992 (“VHCA”), each as amended. If future products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule, additional laws and requirements apply.\nUnder the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and\nU.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service-designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs\nincluding Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, discounted prices must be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate\nsystem. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry\ninto government procurement contracts governed by the federal acquisition regulations.\nIn order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of\npharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state, even if such manufacturers or distributors have\nno place of business within the state. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic\nreports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities or register their sales representatives. Other legislation has been enacted in certain\nstates prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\nLikewise, these activities are subject to authorization or license requirements, or other legal requirements, under EU or EU member states’ law, or the law of other countries\nwhere we operate or have products manufactured or distributed.\n46\nCost of Compliance with Environmental Laws\nOur operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of\npollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs,\nincluding cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under\nenvironmental laws. We are not aware of any costs or effects of our compliance with environmental laws.\nClimate Change Related Regulation\nOur operations are focused on research and development of pharmaceutical products, and a significant portion of such research and development is conducted outside\nof our facilities and by outsourced contract research organizations or universities. As a result, we do not anticipate any regulation surrounding climate change to impact our\noperations.\nHowever, there is potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact the facilities of our partners and our future\nsuppliers. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to the facilities of our partners and future suppliers and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the\nfuture. We periodically review our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and other natural disasters and update our assessments accordingly. Based on our reviews, we\ndo not believe these potential risks are material to our operations at this time.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of March 20, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had four full-time employees. One of these employees is located in the U.K., and three are located in the U.S.\nIn addition, we employ a limited number of part-time employees on a temporary basis, as well as scientific advisors, consultants and service providers, mainly through\nacademic institutions and contract research organizations.\nWe have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or represented by a labor union. We believe that we\nhave good relationships with our employees.\nOur human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees,\nadvisors, and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-\nbased compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and\nachieve our objectives.\nCorporate History\nFormation\nWe were formed as a blank check company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 7, 2016. We were formed for the purpose of effecting a\nmerger, capital stock exchange, stock purchase, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses. Since formation, we focused our\nefforts on acquiring an operating company in the healthcare and related wellness industry although our efforts in identifying a prospective target business were not limited to a\nparticular industry.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 7, 2017, pursuant to our Initial Public Offering (the “IPO”), we sold 11,500,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit, inclusive of 1,500,000 Units sold\nto the underwriters on June 23, 2017 upon the underwriters’ election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000. Each “Unit”\nconsisted of one-380th of a share of our common stock, one right to receive one-3,800th of one share of our common stock upon the consummation of a business combination\n(“Right”), and one redeemable warrant to purchase one-seven hundred sixtieth of one share of our common stock (the “Public Warrants”). Each Public Warrant entitles the\nholder to purchase one- seven hundred sixtieth of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per 1/760th of one share ($4,370.00 per whole share), subject to\nadjustment. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants became exercisable 12 months from the closing of the IPO, and\nexpire five years after the completion of the Business Combination (November 6, 2025).\n47\nWe may redeem the Public Warrants, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant upon 30 days’ notice (“30-day redemption period”), only in the\nevent that the last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $6,840.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day\nprior to the date on which notice of redemption is given, provided there is an effective registration statement with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such Public\nWarrants and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period. If we call the Public Warrants for redemption\nas described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In determining whether to\nrequire all holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a “cashless basis,” management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of Public Warrants that\nare outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Public Warrants. Each\nholder of a Right received one-3,800th (1/3,800) of one share of common stock upon consummation of the Business Combination. No fractional shares were issued upon\nexchange of the Rights.\nPrivate Placement\nConcurrent with the closing of the IPO, KBL IV Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”) and the underwriters purchased an aggregate of 450,000 unregistered Units (“Private\nUnits”) at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $4,500,000 in a private placement. In addition, on June 23, 2017, we consummated the sale of an additional 52,500\nPrivate Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, which were purchased by the Sponsor and underwriters, generating gross proceeds of $525,000. Of these, 377,500 Private Units\nwere purchased by the Sponsor and 125,000 Private Units were purchased by the underwriters. The proceeds from the Private Units were added to the net proceeds from the\nIPO held in a Trust Account (the “Trust Account”). The Private Units (including their component securities) were not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the\ncompletion of the Business Combination (defined below) and the warrants included in the Private Units (the “Private Placement Warrants”) will be non-redeemable so long as\nthey are held by the Sponsor, the underwriters or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor, the underwriters or\ntheir permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the Units\nsold in the IPO. In addition, for as long as the Private Placement Warrants are held by the underwriters or its designees or affiliates, they may not be exercised after five years\nfrom the effective date of the registration statement related to the IPO. Otherwise, the Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the\nwarrants sold as part of the Units in the IPO and have no net cash settlement provisions.\nBusiness Combination\nOn July 25, 2019, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”), with KBL Merger\nSub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), 180 Life Corp. (f/k/a 180 Life Sciences Corp.) (“180”), Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Katexco”), CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“CBR\nPharma”), 180 Therapeutics L.P. (“180 LP” and together with Katexco and CBR Pharma, the “180 Subsidiaries” and, together with 180 Life Sciences Corp., the “180 Parties”),\nand Lawrence Pemble, in his capacity as representative of the stockholders of the 180 Parties (the “Stockholder Representative”). The business combination described in the\nBusiness Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination”), closed and became effective on November 6, 2020 (the “Closing”). Pursuant to the Business Combination\nAgreement, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into 180, with 180 continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the\n“Merger”). In connection with, and prior to, the Closing, 180 Life Sciences Corp. filed a Certificate of Amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation in Delaware to change its\nname to 180 Life Corp., and our company (which was known as of our entry into the Business Combination as KBL Merger Corp. IV, changed our name to 180 Life Sciences\nCorp.).\n180 was incorporated in Delaware on January 28, 2019. Prior to the Closing of the Business Combination, 180 operated through three subsidiaries: 180 LP, a Delaware\nlimited partnership formed on September 6, 2013; Katexco, a company incorporated in British Columbia, Canada on March 7, 2018; and CBR Pharma, a company incorporated\nin British Columbia, Canada on March 8, 2018.\n48\nIn July 2019, 180 and each of 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma completed a corporate restructuring, pursuant to which 180 LP, Katexco and CBR Pharma became\nwholly-owned subsidiaries of 180LS (the “Reorganization”). The corporate restructuring arrangements with respect to Katexco and CBR Pharma were completed under\nthe Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).\nOn November 6, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), we consummated the Business Combination following a special meeting of stockholders held on November 5, 2020,\nwhere the stockholders of the Company considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt the Business Combination. Pursuant to the Business Combination\nAgreement, among other things, Merger Sub merged with and into 180, with 180 continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The\nMerger became effective on November 6, 2020 (such time, the “Effective Time”, and the closing of the Merger being referred to herein as the “Closing”). In connection with,\nand prior to, the Closing, 180 filed a Certificate of Amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation in Delaware to change its name to 180 Life Corp. and KBL Merger Corp. IV\nchanged its name to 180 Life Sciences Corp.\nAt the Effective Time, each share of 180 common stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time was automatically converted into the right to receive\napproximately 0.44310 shares of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (such shares of common stock issuable to the common stockholders of 180\npursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the “Merger Consideration Shares”). An aggregate of 46,039 shares of common stock have been issued to date to the\ncommon stockholders of 180 as Merger Consideration Shares, including the Escrow Shares (as defined below). Also at the Effective Time, each share underlying the 180\npreferred stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time was converted into the right to receive one Class C Special Voting Share of the Company, or one Class K\nSpecial Voting Share of the Company, as applicable (such shares, the “Special Voting Shares”). The Special Voting Shares entitle the holder thereof to an aggregate number of\nvotes, on any particular matter, proposition or question, equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares (as defined below) of each of CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC and Katexco\nPurchaseco ULC, Canadian subsidiaries of 180, respectively, that are outstanding from time to time.\nAs a result of the Merger, the existing exchangeable shares (collectively, the “Exchangeable Shares”) of CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC and/or Katexco Purchaseco\nULC were adjusted in accordance with the share provisions in the articles of CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC or Katexco Purchaseco ULC, as applicable, governing the\nExchangeable Shares such that they were multiplied by the exchange ratio for the Merger and became exchangeable into shares of common stock. The Exchangeable Shares\nentitle the holders to dividends and other rights that are substantially economically equivalent to those of holders of common stock, and holders of Exchangeable Shares have\nthe right to vote at meetings of the stockholders of the Company. An aggregate of 14 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance to the holders of the Exchangeable\nShares upon the exchange thereof.\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, 2,764 of the Merger Consideration Shares (such shares, the “Escrow Shares”) were deposited into an escrow\naccount (the “Escrow Account”) to serve as security for, and the exclusive source of payment of, our indemnity rights under the Business Combination Agreement, all of which\nwere planned to be released to the same stockholders 12 months following the Closing of the Business Combination, but for a claim made by Dr. Krauss against these shares\nwhich is pending.\nAs a result of the Business Combination, the former stockholders of 180 became the controlling stockholders of the Company and 180 became a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of the Company. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby 180 is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting\npurposes.\nIn connection with the Closing, we withdrew $9,006,493 of funds from the Trust Account (as defined below) to fund the redemptions of 2,149 shares.\nReverse Stock Splits\nDecember 2022 Reverse Stock Split\nOn December 15, 2022, at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders of 180 Life Sciences Corp., our stockholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of\nIncorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, by a ratio of between one-for-four to one-\nfor-twenty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be determined by our Board or a duly authorized committee thereof in its discretion, at any time after\napproval of the amendment and prior to December 15, 2023. On December 15, 2022, our Board, with the Stockholder Authority, approved an amendment to our Second\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20.\nImmediately after the Special Meeting and the approval thereof by the Board, on December 15, 2022, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Second Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the Reverse Stock Split.\n49\nPursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, the Reverse Stock Split became effective on December 19, 2022 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time. No change was made to the\ntrading symbol for our shares of common stock or public warrants, “ATNF” and “ATNFW”, respectively, in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Certificate of Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized shares of our common stock, nor alter the par value of our common stock or modify any voting\nrights or other terms of our common stock.\nNo fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split and stockholders of record who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares,\nwere instead entitled to have their fractional shares rounded up to the nearest whole share.\nFebruary 2024 Reverse Stock Split\nOn February 16, 2024, at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders of the Company, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, by a ratio of\nbetween one-for-four to one-for-forty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be determined by our Board of Directors.\nOn February 26, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a one-for-19 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding common stock and the filing of a\nCertificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to affect such reverse stock split, which was filed on February 26, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split became effective\non February 28, 2024 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time, with shares beginning trading on a split-adjusted basis at market open on February 28, 2024. In connection with the Reverse\nStock Split, every 19 shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time were automatically converted into one share of the Company’s\ncommon stock.\nIn connection with the reverse split, all outstanding options, warrants, and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of common\nstock were adjusted as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under the Company’s equity incentive plans were also\nappropriately adjusted. Following the reverse split, the par value of the Common Stock remained unchanged at $0.0001 par value per share. The reverse split did not change the\nauthorized number of shares of common stock or preferred stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse split, and stockholders who would otherwise\nbe entitled to receive a fractional share instead received one whole share of common stock in lieu of such fractional share.\nThe effects of the 1-for-19 Reverse Stock Split have been retroactively reflected throughout this Report.\nCorporate Structure\nThe chart below shows our current organizational structure:\n50\nAbout Us\nOur principal executive offices are located at 3000 El Camino Real, Bldg. 4, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94306, and our telephone number is (650) 507-0669.

RISK FACTORS.\nSummary Risk Factors\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, risks associated with our business include:\n● we are a clinical stage biotechnology company that had no revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and do not anticipate generating revenue for\nthe near future;\n● our need for additional financing, both near term and long term, to support our operations, our ability to raise such financing as needed, the terms of such\nfinancing, if available, potential significant dilution associated therewith, and covenants and restrictions we may need to comply with in connection with such\nfunding;\n● our dependence on the success of our future product candidates, some of which may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized; problems\nin our manufacturing process for our new products and/or our failure to comply with manufacturing regulations, or unexpected increases in our manufacturing\ncosts; problems with distribution of our products; and failure to adequately market our products;\n● risks associated with the growth of our business, our ability to maintain such growth, difficulties in managing our growth, and executing our growth strategy;\n● liability for previously restated financial statements and associated with ineffective controls and procedures, as well as costs and expenses related to the\nindemnification of current and former officers and directors;\n● our dependence on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees and consultants;\n● risks from intense competition from companies with greater resources and experience than we have;\n● our ability to receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and the timeline and costs associated therewith, including the uncertainties associated with\nthe clinical development and regulatory approval of our drug candidates, including potential delays in the enrollment and completion of clinical trials, issues\nraised by the FDA and the MHRA;\n● risks that our future product candidates, if approved by regulatory authorities, may be unable to achieve the expected market acceptance and, consequently, limit\nour ability to generate revenue from new products;\n● the outcome of currently pending and future claims and litigation, future government investigations, and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and\nresults of operations;\n● the fact that the majority of our license agreements provide the licensors and/or counter-parties the right to use, own and/or exploit such licensed intellectual\nproperty;\n● preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials may not necessarily be predictive of future results and may not have favorable results; we have limited marketing\nexperience, and our future ability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, even if they are approved in the future is unknown; and business\ninterruptions could delay us in the process of developing our future product candidates and could disrupt our product sales;\n● third-party payors may not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement levels for any future products;\n● liability from lawsuits (including product liability lawsuits, stockholder lawsuits and regulatory matters), including judgments, damages, fines and penalties and\nincluding the outcome of currently pending litigation, potential future government investigations, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business\nand results of operations;\n● security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions which could prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liabilities or damages;\n51\n● risks associated with clinical trials that are expensive, time-consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, delay or termination and which are open to differing\ninterpretations, delays in the trials, testing, application, or approval process for drug candidates and/or our ability to obtain approval for promising drug\ncandidates, and the costs associated therewith;\n● our ability to comply with existing and future rules and regulations, including federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations and implementation of, or\nchanges to, such healthcare laws and regulations;\n● our ability to adequately protect our future product candidates or our proprietary technology in the marketplace, claims and liability from third parties regarding\nour alleged infringement of their intellectual property;\n● differences in laws and regulations between countries and other jurisdictions and changes in laws or regulations, including, but not limited to tax laws and\ncontrolled substance laws, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations;\n● conflicts of interest between our officers, directors, consultants and scientists;\n● penalties associated with our failure to comply with certain pre-agreed contractual obligations and restrictions;\n● dilution caused by future fund raising, the conversion/exercise of outstanding convertible securities, and downward pressure on the value of our securities caused\nby such future issuances/sales;\n● negative effects on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential future pandemics;\n● the extremely volatile nature of our securities and potential lack of liquidity thereof;\n● the fact that our Certificate of Incorporation provides for indemnification of officers and directors, limits the liability of officers and directors, allows for the\nauthorization of preferred stock without stockholder approval, and includes certain other anti-takeover provisions and exclusive forum provisions;\n● our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock and warrants on Nasdaq and the costs of compliance with SEC and Nasdaq rules and requirements;\n● failure of our information technology systems, including cybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, that could significantly disrupt the operation of our\nbusiness;\n● the fact that we may acquire other companies which could divert our management’s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise\ndisrupt our operations and harm our operating results and if we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business;\n● the effect of changes in inflation and interest rates, and economic downturns, including potential recessions, as well as macroeconomic, geopolitical, health and\nindustry trends, pandemics, acts of war (including the ongoing Ukraine/Russian and Hamas/Israel conflict) and other large-scale crises, as well as the potential\nimplications of a Congressional impasse over the U.S. debt limit or possible future U.S. governmental shutdowns over budget disagreements;\n● the fact that we do not currently have $2.5 million or more of stockholders’ equity, and as a result, we are not in compliance with the continued listing\nrequirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market and our common stock and public warrants are subject to delisting;\n● the fact that we may apply working capital and future funding to uses that ultimately do not improve our operating results or increase the value of our securities;\nand\n● our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\n52\nYou should be aware that there are substantial risks for an investment in our common stock. You should carefully consider these risk factors before you decide to\ninvest in our common stock.\nIf any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or other prospects, could be materially adversely affected, and\nthe occurrence of any of these risks could materially affect our likelihood of success. If that happens, the market price of our common stock, if any, could decline, and\nprospective investors would lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. This section discusses factors\nthat, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Our business, financial condition or results of\noperations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the following description of Risk\nFactors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties applicable to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur current cash balance is only expected to be sufficient to fund our planned business operations through approximately May 2024. If additional capital is not\navailable, we may not be able to pursue our planned business operations, may be forced to change our planned business operations, or may take other actions that could\nadversely impact our stockholders, including seeking bankruptcy protection.\nWe are a clinical stage biotechnology company that currently has no revenue. Thus, our business does not generate the cash necessary to finance our planned business\noperations. We will require significant additional capital to: (i) develop FDA and/or MHRA-approved products and commercialize such products; (ii) fund research and\ndevelopment activities relating to, and obtain regulatory approval for, our product candidates; (iii) protect our intellectual property; (iv) attract and retain highly-qualified\npersonnel; (v) respond effectively to competitive pressures; and (vi) acquire complementary businesses or technologies.\nOur future capital needs depend on many factors, including: (i) the scope, duration and expenditures associated with our research, development and commercialization\nefforts; (ii) continued scientific progress in our programs; (iii) the outcome of potential partnering or licensing transactions, if any; (iv) competing technological developments;\n(v) our proprietary patent position; and (vi) the regulatory approval process for our products.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to finance\nour planned business operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. General market conditions, rising interest rates and\ninflation, as well as global conflicts such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, and Israel and Hamas, may make it difficult for us to seek financing from the\ncapital markets, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity\nsecurities, further dilution to our stockholders will result, which may substantially dilute the value of their investment. Any equity financing may also have the effect of\nreducing the conversion or exercise price of our outstanding convertible or exercisable securities, which could result in the issuance (or potential issuance) of a significant\nnumber of additional shares of our common stock. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights\nsuperior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility to conduct future business activities and,\nin the event of insolvency, could be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of our assets. We may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies\nor product candidates, or grant licenses through alliance, joint venture or agreements on terms that are not favorable to us, in order to raise additional funds. If adequate funds\nare not available, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities with respect to our business, or terminate our operations, or may be forced to\nseek bankruptcy protection. These actions would likely reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe will need additional capital which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, which raises questions about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $127,343,657 and a working capital deficit of $1,422,710, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, a\nnet loss of $19,935,112 and cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, of $10,922,223. As of March 18, 2024, we had cash on hand of\napproximately $0.8 million. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. As we are not generating\nrevenues, we need to raise a significant amount of capital in order to pay our debts and cover our operating costs. While we recently raised funds through the sale of equity in\nJuly 2022 (approximately $6.5 million of gross proceeds), December 2022 (approximately $6.0 million of gross proceeds), April 2023 (approximately $3.0 million of gross\nproceeds), August 2023 (approximately $3.0 million) and November 2023 (approximately $0.8 million), there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional needed\ncapital or that such capital will be available under favorable terms.\n53\nWe are subject to all the substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the absence of a\nlong-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating losses until we can successfully implement our business\nstrategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. We may never ever achieve profitable operations or generate significant revenues.\nWe currently have a monthly cash requirement spend of approximately $350,000. We believe that in the aggregate, we will require significant additional capital\nfunding to support and expand the research and development and marketing of our products, fund future clinical trials, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for\nadditional equipment and development costs, payment obligations, office space and systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs until our planned\nrevenue streams from products are fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs, if ever.\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations with the proceeds from equity and debt financing. We have experienced liquidity issues due to, among other\nreasons, our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the sale of equity and debt funding that is convertible into shares of\nour common stock to fund our operations and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that exposure. We anticipate that we will need to issue equity to fund our operations and\nfund our operating expenses for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to achieve operational profitability or we are not successful in securing other forms of financing, we\nwill have to evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of\nliabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of\nassets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. The Consolidated Financial Statements included herein also\ninclude a going concern footnote.\nAdditionally, wherever possible, our board of directors (“Board of Directors” or “Board”) will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many\ninstances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock.\nOur Board has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which generally require stockholder approval for any\ntransactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then\noutstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase\nsuch shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions\nwill result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may\nalso serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing\nmanagement.\nWe will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, causing dilution to our stockholders, restricting our operations or\nadversely affecting our ability to operate our business.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, including as a result of macroeconomic conditions such as a severe or prolonged\neconomic downturn. Disruption, uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets could increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to raise funds needed to operate our\nbusiness. Disruptions could be caused by Federal Reserve policies and actions, currency concerns, inflation, economic downturn or uncertainty, monetary policies, failures of\nfinancial institutions, U.S. debt management concerns, and U.S. debt limit and budget disputes, including government shutdowns, European and worldwide sovereign debt\nconcerns, other global or geopolitical events, or other factors. Current macroeconomic conditions have negatively impacted the U.S. banking sector, including for example, the\nrecent closures and FDIC receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Although we do not have any accounts at or business relationships with these banks, we\nmay be negatively impacted by other disruptions to the U.S. banking system caused by these or similar developments.\n54\nWe have significant and increasing liquidity needs and require additional funding.\nResearch and development, management and administrative expenses, including legal expenses, and cash used for operations will continue to be significant and may\nincrease substantially in the future in connection with new research and development initiatives, clinical trials, continued product commercialization efforts and the launch of\nour future product candidates. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, continue to conduct clinical trials to support potential regulatory approval of\nmarketing applications, and to fund commercialization of our future product candidates.\nThe amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the timing of FDA and/or MHRA approval, if any, and approvals in other international markets of our future product candidates, if at all;\n● the timing and amount of revenue from sales of our products, or revenue from grants or other sources;\n● the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other product development programs;\n● costs of establishing or outsourcing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n● costs and timing of any outsourced growing and commercial manufacturing supply arrangements for our future product candidates;\n● costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our future product candidates;\n● the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n● personnel, facilities and equipment requirements; and\n● the terms and timing of any additional collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish.\n55\nWhile we expect to fund our future capital requirements from a number of sources, such as cash flow from operations and the proceeds from further public and/or\nprivate offerings, we cannot assure you that any of these funding sources will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Further, even if we can raise funds from all of the\nabove sources, the amounts raised may not be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements.\nOur License Agreements with the University of Oxford and other licensors may be terminated in certain circumstances without our consent.\nAll of our License Agreements with the University of Oxford and other licensors remain subject to various conditions and covenants, and provide for certain\ntermination rights to the licensors. Those agreements typically allow termination by the licensor for our failure to pay amounts due timely, our failure to cure a material breach\nunder the terms of the applicable license agreement, and our insolvency. As a result, if we are deemed insolvent, or in the event we seek bankruptcy protection, the licensors of\nour license agreements may terminate their license agreements with us. In the event such license agreements are terminated, we could lose the right to develop all of our\nplatforms and technologies, may lose any investments made towards developing such platforms and technologies, and may be left without any intellectual property, product\npathways, or development opportunities. Such terminations may result in the value of our securities declining in value or becoming worthless, the need for us to change our\nbusiness plan, and may result in the Company seeking bankruptcy protection.\nWe owe a significant amount of money to the University of Oxford, which funds we do not have. The university may take action against us to enforce their rights\nto payment in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our operations.\nDue to recent financial constraints, the Company has been unable to timely pay amounts due to the University of Oxford (“Oxford”), the licensor of the majority of the\nCompany’s licenses and patents and the Company’s research partner. Oxford alleges that an aggregate of approximately £929,030 is owed from the Company and one of its\nsubsidiaries to Oxford under the terms of licenses and agreements with Oxford and related parties. The Company is currently in ongoing discussions with Oxford to reduce that\namount and enter into a payment plan with regards to the amounts owed; however, no definitive terms or extensions have been agreed to date. Oxford has also notified the\nCompany that it is not willing to discuss any new projects or arrangements until all outstanding invoices have been paid or a payment plan has been agreed to; has engaged a\nlaw firm to seek the collection of the amounts owed, together with interest; and has threatened legal proceedings against us. While we are hopeful that we can come to mutually\nagreeable terms regarding a settlement, payment plan, and/or extension, with Oxford, we may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due to Oxford in the near term, if at all,\nand Oxford may take action against us, including filing legal proceedings against us seeking amounts due and interest, attempting to terminate their relationship with us, and/or\nfiling a wind-up petition against one of the Company’s subsidiaries in the U.K.. If Oxford were to take legal action against us or terminate their relationship with us, we may be\nforced to scale back our business plan and/or seek bankruptcy protection. We may be subject to litigation and damages for our failure to pay amounts due to Oxford, and may be\nforced to pay interest and penalties, which funds we do not currently have. We plan to seek to raise funding in the future to support our operations, and to pay amounts due to\nOxford, through a combination of equity offerings, debt financing or other capital sources, including potentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements, which\nmay not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. Additionally,\nin December 2023, we engaged A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners as financial advisor to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Potential\nstrategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include, but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, other\nbusiness combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic transactions involving the Company. The Company does not intend to discuss or disclose further developments\nduring this process unless and until its Board of Directors has approved a specific action or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate. There is no assurance\nthat the strategic review process will result in the approval or completion of any specific transaction or outcome.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency values.\nWe expend expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional currency of certain subsidiaries is the\nCanadian Dollar (“CAD”) or British Pound (“£” or “GBP”). The resulting translation adjustments are recognized in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of an entity from all sources other than investments by owners or distributions to owners and\nincludes foreign currency translation adjustments as described above. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded other comprehensive (loss) of\n($15,816) and ($3,702,963), respectively, as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments.\n56\nChanges in the value of the currencies which we pay expenses (and in the future receive revenues), versus each other, and the U.S. dollar, could result in an adverse\ncharge being recorded to our income statement.\nGlobal economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit,\nhigher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations, as well as the potential implications of a Congressional impasse over the U.S. debt limit or possible future\nU.S. governmental shutdowns over budget disagreements, could materially adversely affect our operations, expenses, access to capital and the market for our planned future\nproducts. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real\nestate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nIn addition, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on our funding sources, suppliers and partners.\nPotential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of our future planned products; and insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment could also lead to limitations on our ability to sell equity or issue new debt; reduce liquidity; and result in declines in the fair\nvalue of our financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\nOur industry and the broader U.S. economy have experienced higher than expected inflationary pressures during 2022 and 2023, related to continued supply\nchain disruptions, labor shortages and geopolitical instability. Should these conditions persist our business, future results of operations and cash flows could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nDuring 2022 and the early part of 2023, there were significant increases in the costs of certain materials, products and shipping costs, as a result of availability\nconstraints, supply chain disruption, increased demand, labor shortages associated with a fully employed U.S. labor force, high inflation and other factors. Supply and demand\nfundamentals have been further aggravated by disruptions in global energy supply caused by multiple geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and\nUkraine, and Israel and Hamas, which threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries. Service, materials and shipping costs have also increased accordingly with general\nsupply chain and inflation issues seen throughout the U.S. leading to increased operating costs. Supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures have in the past and may in\nthe future, adversely impact our operating costs and may negatively impact our future product costs, consulting costs and expenses which could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic uncertainty may affect our access to capital and/or increase the costs of such capital.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be volatile and uncertain due to, among other things, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, fears of recession\nand trade wars, the price of energy, fluctuating interest rates, the availability and cost of consumer credit, the availability and timing of government stimulus programs, levels of\nunemployment, increased inflation, tax rates, and the war between Ukraine and Russia which began in February 2022, and Israel and Hamas, which began in October 2023 and\nwhich threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries. These conditions remain unpredictable and create uncertainties about our ability to raise capital in the future. In the\nevent required capital becomes unavailable in the future, or more costly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, future results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nWe may not receive any amounts under our pre-merger directors’ and officers’ insurance policy in connection with certain litigation matters.\nOn June 29, 2022, AmTrust International Underwriters DAC (“AmTrust”), which was the premerger directors’ and officers’ insurance policy underwriter for KBL,\nfiled a declaratory relief action against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Declaratory Relief Action”) seeking declaration of AmTrust’s\nobligations under the directors’ and officers’ insurance policy. In the Declaratory Relief Action, AmTrust is claiming that as a result of the merger, we are no longer the insured\nunder the subject insurance policy, notwithstanding the fact that the fees which we seek to recover from AmTrust relate to matters occurring prior to the merger.\n57\nOn April 21, 2023, the Court issued an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Specifically, the Court\ngranted summary adjudication in favor of the Company on the following issues: (a) that the Company is, in fact, an insured under both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance\npolicies; (b) that certain SEC subpoena related expenses for defendants Dr. Marlene Krauss, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Director, and George Hornig,\nthe former Chairman of the Board, are within the basic scope of coverage under both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; and (c) that the Insured vs. Insured\nexclusion relied upon by AmTrust and Freedom is not applicable to bar any such coverage.\nThe Court also found that there were issues of disputed facts as to the Change in Control exclusion contained within the policies, which therefore precluded the Court\nfrom granting the remainder of the Company’s requests for summary adjudication as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court, at this time, denied the Company’s further requests\nfor summary adjudication and deemed that for the time being, the Change in Control issue is to be determined at the time of trial, in order to find that the policies provide\n(i) coverage for the fees which the Company has advanced and will advance to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig; (ii) that AmTrust has breached the policy; (iii) that\nAmTrust must pay such expenses of the Company; and that, once the AmTrust policy has been exhausted, (iv) that Freedom will be obligated to pay such expenses of the\nCompany pursuant to its policy.\nOn August 4, 2023, the Court granted the Company’s request to file a second motion for partial summary judgment in this case, this one being on the issue of whether\nAmTrust should be required to advance to the Company the defense costs being incurred by Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig during the pendency of the case. The\nCompany filed such Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and it has now been fully briefed by the parties. The hearing for such motion was held on January 11, 2024,\nhowever the Judge took the matter under submission and has not yet issued any decision on the Motion. The parties have commenced written discovery proceedings against\neach other, and it is anticipated that depositions will also occur. The Company intends to continue to vigorously pursue this matter in order to establish the Company’s\nentitlement to full payment by both AmTrust and Freedom of the subject advancement expenses of the Company.\nWhile the Company continues to believe it has a strong case against both AmTrust and Freedom and believes the Court ruling in its favor in regards to the matters\ndiscussed above is a significant positive outcome for the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this action.\nOur ability to generate revenue from any of our potential products is subject to our ability to obtain regulatory approval and fulfill numerous other requirements\nand we may never be successful in generating revenues or becoming profitable.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue or execute other business development arrangements. We do not expect to\ngenerate significant revenue, if any, unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize the product candidates we are developing or\nmay develop. Successful commercialization, to the extent it occurs, will require achievement of many key milestones, including demonstrating safety and efficacy in clinical\ntrials, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling, or entering into other agreements to commercialize, those products for\nwhich we may obtain regulatory approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government\npayors. Because of the uncertainties and risks associated with these activities, we cannot accurately and precisely predict the timing and amount, if any, of revenues, the extent\nof any further losses or when we might achieve profitability. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are sufficient\nenough for us to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\n58\nOur failure to become and remain profitable may depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business,\ndiversify our product offerings or continue our operations.\nWe have recently grown our business and will need to increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in\nmanaging our growth and executing our growth strategy.\nOur management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support our business plan and future growth. We will need to increase our number\nof full-time equivalent employees in order to conduct Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials of our future products and to establish a commercial organization and commercial\ninfrastructure. As a result of these future activities, the complexity of our business operations is expected to substantially increase. We will need to develop and expand our\nscientific, manufacturing, sales and marketing, managerial, compliance, operational, financial and other resources to support our planned research, development, manufacturing\nand commercialization activities.\nOur need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:\n● continue to improve our operational, financial, management and regulatory compliance controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n● attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees;\n● manage our commercialization activities effectively and in a cost-effective manner (currently trial and development for our clinical trials is very cost effective);\nand\n● manage our development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties.\nWe have utilized and continue to utilize the services of part-time outside consultants and contractors to perform a number of tasks for our company, including tasks\nrelated to compliance programs, clinical trial management, regulatory affairs, formulation development and other drug development functions. Our growth strategy may entail\nexpanding our use of consultants and contractors to implement these and other tasks going forward. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new\nemployees and expanding our use of consultants and contractors, we may be unable to successfully implement the tasks necessary to effectively execute on our planned\nresearch, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nWe face liability for previously restated financial statements and/or certain actions of our prior management which led to such restatements.\nWe filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on December 31, 2020 and another Current Report on Form 8-K on February 3, 2021, where we announced that due to matters\nwe discovered which related to KBL, prior to the Business Combination, certain historical financial statements were unreliable. As a result, we restated our financial statements\nfor the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, because of errors in such financial statements which were\nidentified after such financial statements were filed with the SEC in our original quarterly reports for the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020. While we\nbelieve these restatements are the result of the actions of, and are the responsibility of, the management of KBL (none of whom remain employed by us), we may be subject to\nstockholder litigation, SEC actions, fines and penalties, rating downgrades, negative publicity and difficulties in attracting and retaining key clients, employees and\nmanagement personnel as a result of such restatements. Additionally, our securities may trade at prices lower than similarly situated companies which have not had to restate\ntheir financial statements.\nOur failure to appropriately adjust processes resulting from significant one-time transactions may result in a misstatement in the financial statements.\nIn the course of our annual audit but prior to filing, we discovered that an error occurred which caused the fair value of our public warrants to be overstated by an\nimmaterial amount. This error was corrected before the 2022 financial statements were filed. While we believe that the fair value of warrants in our financial statements for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 and since such date are correctly stated, it is possible that similar errors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations, could require us to restate our financial statements for prior periods or in the future.\n59\nOperating results may vary significantly in future periods.\nOur financial results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, for among other reasons, due to commercial sales of our future product candidates; our achievement of\nproduct development objectives and milestones; clinical trial enrollment and expenses; research and development expenses; and the timing and nature of contract\nmanufacturing and contract research payments. A high portion of our costs are predetermined on an annual basis, due in part to our significant research and development costs.\nThus, small declines in future revenue could disproportionately affect financial results in a quarter.\nWe depend on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. We are highly dependent on our current management and\nscientific personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. James N. Woody, our Co-Chairmen, Sir Marc Feldmann, Ph.D., and Lawrence Steinman, M.D., our Chief\nScientific Officer, Jonathan Rothbard, Ph.D., and our scientist, Jagdeep Nanchahal. The inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our\nability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. Due to the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to\nattract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnological field is intense and we may be unable\nto continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nProblems in our manufacturing process for our future chemical entities, failure to comply with manufacturing regulations or unexpected increases in our\nmanufacturing costs could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are responsible for the manufacture and supply of our future product candidates in the CBD derivatives and α7nAChR programs for commercial use and for use in\nclinical trials. The manufacturing of our future product candidates necessitates compliance with GMPs and other regulatory requirements in international jurisdictions. Our\nability to successfully manufacture our future product candidates will involve manufacture of finished products and labeling and packaging, which includes product\ninformation, tamper proof evidence and anti-counterfeit features, under tightly controlled processes and procedures. In addition, we will have to ensure chemical consistency\namong our batches, including clinical trial batches and, if approved, marketing batches. Demonstrating such consistency may require typical manufacturing controls as well as\nclinical data. We will also have to ensure that our batches conform to complex release specifications. If we are unable to manufacture our future product candidates in\naccordance with regulatory specifications, or if there are disruptions in our manufacturing process due to damage, loss or otherwise, or failure to pass regulatory inspections of\nour manufacturing facilities, we may not be able to meet demand or supply sufficient product for use in clinical trials, and this may also harm our ability to commercialize our\nfuture product candidates on a timely or cost-competitive basis, if at all.\nWe may not develop and expand our manufacturing capability in time to meet demand for our product candidates, and the FDA, MHRA or other foreign regulatory\nauthorities may not accept our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers as being suitable for the production of our products and product candidates. Any problems in our\nmanufacturing process could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur memorandum of understanding with Celltrion Healthcare may not result in the parties entering into a definitive agreement.\nIn September 2021, we entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Celltrion Healthcare, a biopharmaceutical company, for the supply of an anti-\nTNF biosimilar drug used in our ongoing development of anti-TNF products. The parties have not entered into a definitive agreement regarding such relationship to date, and\nsuch definitive agreement may not ultimately be entered into on terms contemplated, if at all. In the event that we are unable to come to mutually agreeable definitive terms\nwith Celltrion Healthcare, the Company has been in discussions with an alternative supplier of the anti-TNF biosimilar drug which has expressed interest in proceeding. We\nmay ultimately be unable to find an alternative supplier or such alternative supplier may require less favorable terms than are currently contemplated. Any of the above may\nmaterially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n60\nWe expect to face intense competition from companies with greater resources and experience than we have; and may face competition from competitors seeking to\nmarket our products under a Section 505(b)(2) application.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. The industry continues to expand and evolve as an increasing number of competitors\nand potential competitors enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and\ndevelopment resources and experience than our company. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than our company in the development of\npharmaceutical products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. In addition, our future product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with\nproduct offerings from large and well-established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than our company or our collaboration partners\nhave. In particular, Insys Therapeutics, Inc. is developing CBD in Infantile Spasms (“IS”), and potentially other indications. Zogenix, Inc. has reported positive data in two\nPhase 3 trials of low dose fenfluramine in Dravet syndrome and has commenced a Phase 3 trial with this product in Lennox Gastaut Syndrome. Biocodex recently received\nregulatory approval from the FDA for the drug Stiripentol (Diacomit) for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Other companies with greater resources than our company may\nannounce similar plans in the future. In addition, there are non-FDA approved CBD preparations being made available from companies in the medical marijuana industry,\nwhich might attempt to compete with our future product candidates.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, experience and expertise in:\n● research and development;\n● preclinical testing;\n● designing and implementing clinical trials;\n● regulatory processes and approvals;\n● production and manufacturing; and\n● sales and marketing of approved products.\nPrincipal competitive factors in our industry include:\n● the quality and breadth of an organization’s technology;\n● management of the organization and the execution of the organization’s strategy;\n● the skill and experience of an organization’s employees and its ability to recruit and retain skilled and experienced employees;\n● an organization’s intellectual property portfolio;\n● the range of capabilities, from target identification and validation to drug discovery and development to manufacturing and marketing; and\n● the availability of substantial capital resources to fund discovery, development and commercialization activities.\nAdditionally, competitors may also seek to market versions of our drug products via a section 505(b)(2) application, which is a type of NDA provided in section 505(b)\n(2) of the FDC Act. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is in contrast to an NDA under section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act, which is commonly known as a Full NDA because it requires\nthe applicant to undertake all of the nonclinical and clinical investigations necessary for the approval of the application. In contrast, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application is one\nfor which one or more of the investigations relied on by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a\nright of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a\nmodification, such as a new indication or new dosage form, of a previously approved drug. Section 505(b)(2) applications may rely on the FDA’s previous findings for the\nsafety and effectiveness of the previously approved drug in addition to information obtained by the 505(b)(2) applicant to support the modification of the previously approved\ndrug. Preparing Section 505(b)(2) applications may be less costly and less time-consuming than preparing a Full NDA based entirely on new data and information. Section\n505(b)(2) applications are subject to the same patent certification procedures as an ANDA.\n61\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, our commercial opportunities will be reduced and our business, results of operations and financial conditions may be\nmaterially harmed.\nOur future product candidates, if approved, may be unable to achieve the expected market acceptance and, consequently, limit our ability to generate revenue from\nnew products.\nEven when product development is successful and regulatory approval has been obtained, our ability to generate sufficient revenue depends on the acceptance of our\nproducts by physicians and patients. We cannot assure you that any of our future product candidates will achieve the expected level of market acceptance and revenue if and\nwhen they obtain the requisite regulatory approvals. The market acceptance of any product depends on a number of factors, including the indication statement, warnings\nrequired by regulatory authorities in the product label and new competing products. Market acceptance can also be influenced by continued demonstration of efficacy and\nsafety in commercial use, physicians’ willingness to prescribe the product, reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health care programs and private third-\nparty payors, the price of the product, the nature of any post-approval risk management activities mandated by regulatory authorities, competition, and marketing and\ndistribution support. Further, our U.S. distribution depends on the adequate performance of a reimbursement support hub and contracted specialty pharmacies in a closed-\ndistribution network. An ineffective or inefficient U.S. distribution model at launch may lead to inability to fulfill demand, and consequently a loss of revenue. The success and\nacceptance of a product in one country may be negatively affected by its activities in another. If we fail to adapt our approach to clinical trials in the U.S. market to meet the\nneeds of EMA, MHRA or other European regulatory authorities, or to generate the health economics and outcomes research data needed to support pricing and reimbursement\nnegotiations or decisions in Europe, we may have difficulties obtaining marketing authorization for our products from EMA/European Commission or the MHRA and may\nhave difficulties obtaining pricing and reimbursement approval for our products at a national level. Any factors preventing or limiting the market acceptance of our products\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAll of our patents in the Anti-TNF and Fibrosis program are method of use patents, which may result in biosimilar drugs being used without our permission.\nThe success of our most advanced drug development platform depends on the enforceability of our method of use patents, as there are currently many biosimilar anti-\nTNF drugs in the market. If we are unable to obtain composition of matter patents, and enforce such patents, our ability to generate revenue from the anti-TNF platform may be\nsignificantly limited and competitors may be able to use our research to bring competing drugs to market which would reduce our market share.\nThe majority of our license agreements provide the licensors and/or counter-parties the right to use and/or exploit such licensed intellectual property.\nThe majority of our license agreements provide the licensors and/or counter-parties the right to use and/or exploit such licensed intellectual property, and in some cases\nprovide them ownership of such intellectual property, know-how and research results. As such, we may be in competition with parties who we have license agreements with,\nwill likely not have the sole right to monetize, sell or distribute our product candidates and may be subject to restrictions on use and territory of sales. Any or all of the above\nmay have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and ultimately the value of our securities.\n62\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials may change as more patient data becomes available, and is subject to audit and verification\nprocedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary, interim or topline data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary\nanalysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change as patient enrollment and treatment continues and more patient data\nbecome available. For example, any positive results from our preclinical testing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of our product candidate for any product candidate may not\nnecessarily be predictive of the results from planned or future clinical trials for such product candidates. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries\nhave suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials after achieving positive results in pre-clinical and early clinical development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face\nsimilar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, pre-clinical findings while clinical trials were underway or safety or efficacy observations in clinical\ntrials, including adverse events. Adverse differences between previous preliminary or interim data and future interim or final data could significantly harm our business\nprospects. We may also announce topline data following the completion of a preclinical study or clinical trial, which may be subject to change following a more comprehensive\nreview of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not\nhave received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim, topline or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results\nof the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data has been received and fully evaluated. Preliminary, interim, or\ntopline data also remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the data we previously published. As a\nresult, preliminary, interim, and topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data is available.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh\nthe importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product\nand our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive\ninformation, and you or others may not agree with what we determine to be material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. Moreover, our\ninterpretation of clinical data or our conclusions based on the preclinical in vitro and in vivo models may prove inaccurate, as preclinical and clinical data can be susceptible to\nvarying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless\nfailed to obtain FDA approval or a marketing authorization granted by the European Commission.\nIf we fail to produce positive results in our future clinical trials, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for such product\ncandidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected.\nWe have limited marketing experience, and we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our future product candidates, even if they are approved in\nthe future.\nOur ability to generate revenues ultimately will depend on our ability to sell our approved products and secure adequate third-party reimbursement. We currently have\nno experience in marketing and selling our products. The commercial success of our future products depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the\nwillingness of physicians to prescribe our future products to patients, payors’ willingness and ability to pay for our future products, the level of pricing achieved, patients’\nresponse to our future products, and the ability of our future marketing partners to generate sales. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to establish or maintain the\npersonnel, systems, arrangements and capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our future products or any product candidate approved by the FDA, MHRA or other\nregulatory authority in the future. If we fail to establish or maintain successful marketing, sales and reimbursement capabilities or fail to enter into successful marketing\narrangements with third parties, our product revenues may suffer.\n63\nIf the price for any of our future approved products decreases or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage and adequate\nreimbursement levels, our revenue and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nPatients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their\nprescription drugs. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals generally must be obtained on a\ncountry-by-country basis. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to\nnew product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost\ntherapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Even if we obtain coverage for our future product candidates, the resulting reimbursement\npayment rates may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients may not use our future product candidates if coverage is not provided or reimbursement is\ninadequate to cover a significant portion of a patient’s cost.\nIn addition, the market for our future product candidates in the U.S. will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications\nfor which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on\npharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug\nwhen a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs.\nThe current environment is putting pressure on companies to price products below what they may feel is appropriate. Our future revenues and overall success could be\nnegatively impacted if we sell future product candidates at less than an optimized price. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug\nproducts exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for our future product candidates may differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result,\nthe coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our future product\ncandidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage will be obtained. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate payment levels for, our future\nproduct candidates, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This could\naffect our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and thereby adversely impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future\nsuccess.\nIn addition, where we have chosen to collaborate with a third party on product candidate development and commercialization, our partner may elect to reduce the price\nof our products to increase the likelihood of obtaining reimbursement approvals. In many countries, products cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved\nand the negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months. In addition, pricing and reimbursement decisions in certain countries can be affected by decisions made in\nother countries, which can lead to mandatory price reductions and/or additional reimbursement restrictions across a number of other countries, which may adversely affect sales\nand profitability. In the event that countries impose prices that are not sufficient to allow us or our partners to generate a profit, our partners may refuse to launch the product in\nsuch countries or withdraw the product from the market, which would adversely affect sales and profitability.\nBusiness interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our future product candidates and could disrupt our product sales.\nLoss of our future manufacturing facilities, stored inventory or laboratory facilities through fire, theft or other causes, could have an adverse effect on our ability to\nmeet demand for our future product candidates or to continue product development activities and to conduct our business. Failure to supply our partners with commercial\nproducts may lead to adverse consequences, including the right of partners to assume responsibility for product supply. Even if we obtain insurance coverage to compensate us\nfor such business interruptions, such coverage may prove insufficient to fully compensate us for the damage to our business resulting from any significant property or casualty\nloss to our inventory.\n64\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we will incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit the commercialization of our\nfuture product candidates.\nAlthough we have never had any product liability claims or lawsuits brought against us, we face potential product liability exposure related to the testing of our future\nproduct candidates in human clinical trials, and we will face exposure to claims in jurisdictions where we market and distribute in the future. We may face exposure to claims\nby an even greater number of persons when we begin marketing and distributing our products commercially in the U.S. and elsewhere. In the future, an individual may bring a\nliability claim against us alleging that one of our future product candidates caused an injury. While we plan to take what we believe are appropriate precautions, we may be\nunable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on\ndrugs that had unanticipated side effects. Although we plan to purchase insurance to cover product liability lawsuits, if we cannot successfully defend our company against\nproduct liability claims, or if such insurance coverage is inadequate, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in\ndecreased demand for our products, reputational damage, withdrawal of clinical trial participation participants, litigation costs, product recall costs, monetary awards, increased\ncosts for liability insurance, lost revenues and business interruption.\nOur employees may have previously engaged, and/or may in the future engage, in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with\nregulatory standards and legal requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA, SEC or Office of\nInspector General regulations, or regulations of any other applicable regulatory authority, failure to provide accurate information to the FDA or the SEC, failure to disclose\naccurate information in SEC filings, failure to comply with applicable manufacturing standards, other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations, report information or data\naccurately or disclose unauthorized activities. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information, including information obtained in the course of clinical\ntrials, or illegal appropriation of drug product, which could result in government investigations and serious harm to our reputation. Despite our adoption of a Code of Ethics,\nemployee misconduct is not always possible to identify and deter. The precautions we take to detect and prevent these prohibited activities may not be effective in controlling\nunknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such\nlaws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against our company, and we are not successful in defending our company or asserting our rights, those actions could have\na significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other\nlaws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which\ncould adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries in\nwhich we do business. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit our company and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other\nprohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We and our commercial partners operate in a\nnumber of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could\npotentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to\nwhich our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the U.S., Canada,\nIsrael, the U.K. and authorities in the EU, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency\nexchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control Laws.\nHowever, there is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other\nlegal requirements, including Trade Control Laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control Laws, we may be subject to\ncriminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws by the U.S. or other authorities\ncould also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n65\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical\ninformation or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we expect to collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, credit card information,\npersonally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. The secure processing, storage, maintenance and\ntransmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take\nmeasures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, or\nviruses, breaches or interruptions due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such virus, breach\nor interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures\nin place that are designed to prevent, and if necessary, to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. However, in the future,\nany such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as\nHIPAA and European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or\ndissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to process samples, provide test results, share and monitor safety data, bill payors or patients, provide\ncustomer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects\nof our business and may damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGDPR, which applies to all EU member states includes substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules and may require us to put in place additional\nmechanisms ensuring compliance with the new and changing data protection rules. GDPR is a complex law and the regulatory guidance is still evolving, including with respect\nto how GDPR should be applied in the context of clinical trials or other transactions from which we may gain access to personal data. GDPR increases our costs of compliance\nand results in greater legal risks.\nOur research and development programs and product candidates are in development. As a result, we are unable to predict if or when we will successfully develop\nor commercialize our product candidates.\nOur clinical-stage product candidates as well as our other drug pipeline candidates will require significant further investment and regulatory approvals prior to\ncommercialization. Each of our product candidates will require clinical trial designs that meet the standards and requirements of the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities, the selection of suitable end points and patients for our clinical trials and additional clinical development, management of clinical, preclinical and\nmanufacturing activities, obtaining regulatory approval, obtaining manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization, substantial investment and significant\nmarketing efforts before we generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory\napproval from the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. By\nsuch time, if ever, as we may receive necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates, the standard of care for the treatment of diseases associated with our product\ncandidates may have evolved such that it would be necessary to modify our plans for full approval and commercial acceptance of our products may be limited by a change in\nthe standard of care.\nEven if we obtain the required financing or establish a collaboration to enable us to conduct late-stage clinical development of our product candidates and pipeline\nassets, we cannot be certain that such clinical development would be successful, or that we will obtain regulatory approval or be able to successfully commercialize any of our\nproduct candidates and generate revenue. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the clinical trial\nprocess may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for their proposed uses. Any such failure could cause us to abandon further development of\nany one or more of our product candidates and may delay development of other product candidates. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the\ndesired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay and\npossibly preclude the submission of any NDAs with the FDA, Marketing Authorisation Applications (MAA) or Conditional Marketing Authorisations (CMA) with the MHRA,\nor similar authorizations with other foreign regulatory agencies, and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenue.\n66\nWe have not previously submitted an NDA to the FDA, or MAA or CMA to the MHRA, or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any\nproduct candidate, and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory\napproval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even\nif we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon our or our collaborators’ and\nfuture collaborators’ ability to obtain regulatory approval for the companion diagnostics to be used with our product candidates, if required, and upon the size of the markets in\nthe territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we\nmay not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nFurther, even if any product candidate we develop was to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies, we\nwould continue to bear the risks that the FDA, MHRA or other similar foreign regulatory authorities could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with our product\ncandidate or that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with these existing therapies.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, will depend on achieving market acceptance and we may not be able to gain sufficient\nacceptance to generate significant revenue.\nEven if our product candidates are successfully developed and receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients,\nhealthcare payors such as private insurers or governments and other funding parties and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance for any of our products will\ndepend on a number of factors, including:\n● demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of our products;\n● the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n● limitations or warnings contained in the product’s approved labeling;\n● cost-effectiveness and availability of acceptable pricing;\n● competitive product profile versus alternative treatment methods and the superiority of alternative treatment or therapeutics;\n● the effectiveness of marketing and distribution methods and support for the products; and\n● the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors to the extent that our products receive regulatory approval.\nDisease indications may be small subsets of a disease that could be parsed into smaller and smaller indications as different subsets of diseases are defined. This\nincreasingly fine characterization of diseases could have negative consequences; including creating an approved indication that is so small as not to have a viable market for us.\nIf future technology allows characterization of a disease in a way that is different from the characterization used for large pivotal studies, it may make those studies invalid or\nreduce their usefulness, and may require repeating all or a portion of the studies. Future technology may supply better prognostic ability which could reduce the portion of\npatients projected to need a new therapy. Even after being cleared by regulatory authorities, a product may later be shown to be unsafe or not to have its purported effect,\nthereby preventing its widespread use or requiring withdrawal from the market.\nWe may not be successful in establishing development and commercialization collaborations which could adversely affect, and potentially prohibit, our ability to\ndevelop our product candidates.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved\nproducts is expensive, and therefore we have, and may in the future, seek to enter into collaborations with companies that have more resources and experience in order to\ncontinue to develop and commercialize our product candidates. We also may be required due to financial or scientific constraints to enter into additional collaboration\nagreements to research and/or to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The establishment and realization of such collaborations may not be possible or may be\nproblematic. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish such additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, or that our current or future collaborative\narrangements will be successful or maintained for any specific product candidate or indication. If we are unable to reach successful agreements with suitable collaboration\npartners for the ongoing development and commercialization of our product candidates, we may face increased costs, we may be forced to limit the scope and number of our\nproduct candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize such product candidates, and we may be unable to commercialize products or\nprograms for which a suitable collaboration partner cannot be found. If we fail to achieve successful collaborations, our operating results and financial condition will be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n67\nIn addition, the terms of any collaboration agreements may place restrictions on our activities with respect to other products, including by limiting our ability to grant\nlicenses or develop products with other third parties, or in different indications, diseases or geographical locations, or may place additional obligations on us with respect to\ndevelopment or commercialization of our product candidates. If we fail to comply with or breach any provision of a collaboration agreement, a collaborator may have the right\nto terminate, in whole or in part, such agreement or to seek damages.\nOur collaboration and licensing agreements are, and may in the future be, complex and involve sharing or division of ownership of certain data, know-how and\nintellectual property rights among the various parties. Accordingly, our collaborators could interpret certain provisions differently than we or our other collaborators which\ncould lead to unexpected or inadvertent disputes with collaborators. In addition, these agreements might make additional collaborations, partnering or mergers and acquisitions\ndifficult.\nThere is no assurance that a collaborator who is acquired by a third party would not attempt to change certain contract provisions that could negatively affect our\ncollaboration. The acquiring company may also not accept the terms or assignment of our contracts and may seek to terminate the agreements. Any one of our collaborators\ncould breach covenants, restrictions and/or sub-license agreement provisions leading us into disputes and potential breaches of our agreements with other partners.\nWe will not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates without establishing sales and marketing capabilities internally or through collaborators.\nWe may not be able to find suitable sales and marketing staff and collaborators for all of our product candidates. The development of a marketing and sales capability\nwill require significant expenditures, management resources and time. The cost of establishing such a sales force may exceed any potential product revenue, or our marketing\nand sales efforts may be unsuccessful. If we are unable to develop an internal marketing and sales capability in a timely fashion, or at all, or if we are unable to enter into a\nmarketing and sales arrangement with a third party on acceptable terms, we may be unable to effectively market and sell approved products, if any, which would prevent us\nfrom being able to generate revenue and attain profitability. Further, we may not develop an internal marketing and sales capability if we are unable to successfully develop and\nseek regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe will rely upon third-party contractors and service providers for the execution of some aspects of our development programs. Failure of these collaborators to\nprovide services of a suitable quality and within acceptable timeframes may cause the delay or failure of our development programs.\nWe outsource certain functions, tests and services to third parties, partners, medical institutions and collaborators and plan to outsource manufacturing to collaborators\nand/or contract manufacturers, and we will rely on third parties for quality assurance, clinical monitoring, clinical data management and regulatory expertise. In particular, we\nrely on our partners to run our clinical trials. There is no assurance that such individuals or organizations will be able to provide the functions, tests, drug supply or services as\nagreed upon or to acceptable quality standards, and we could suffer significant delays in the development of our products or processes. In particular, certain third party service\nproviders may be unable to comply with their contractual obligations to us due to disruptions caused by lack of qualified employees and consultants, reduced operations or\nheadcount reductions, or otherwise, and in certain cases we may have limited recourse if the non-compliance is due to factors outside of the service provider’s control.\n68\nOur business is highly dependent on the success of our product candidates. If we are unable to successfully complete clinical development, obtain regulatory\napproval for or commercialize one or more of our product candidates, or if we experience delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur future success and ability to generate significant revenue from our product candidates, which we do not expect will occur for several years, is dependent on our\nability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, including our Dupuytren’s Contracture product\ncandidate, which has previously completed a successful Phase 2b clinical trial in the U.K., a condition that affects the development of fibrous connective tissue in the palm of\nthe hand. All of our other product candidates are in earlier stages of development and will require substantial additional investment for manufacturing, preclinical testing,\nclinical development, regulatory review and approval in one or more jurisdictions. If any of our product candidates encounter safety or efficacy problems, development delays\nor regulatory issues or other problems, our development plans and business would be materially harmed.\nWe may not have the financial resources to continue development of our product candidates. Even if clinical trials are completed, we may experience other issues that\nmay delay or prevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, our product candidates, including:\n● inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidates are safe and\neffective;\n● insufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n● negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials, preclinical studies or the clinical trials of others for product candidates that are similar to ours, leading to a\ndecision or requirement to conduct additional clinical trials or preclinical studies or abandon a program;\n● product-related adverse events experienced by subjects in our clinical trials, including unexpected toxicity results, or by individuals using drugs or therapeutic\nbiologics similar to our product candidates;\n● delays in submitting an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, or comparable foreign applications or delays or failure in obtaining the necessary approvals\nfrom regulators to commence a clinical trial or a suspension or termination, or hold, of a clinical trial once commenced;\n● conditions imposed by the FDA, the EMA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n● poor effectiveness of our product candidates during clinical trials;\n● better than expected performance of control arms, such as placebo groups, which could lead to negative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials;\n● delays in enrolling subjects in clinical trials;\n● high drop-out rates of subjects from clinical trials;\n● inadequate supply or quality of product candidates or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n● greater than anticipated clinical trial or manufacturing costs;\n● unfavorable FDA, EMA, MHRA or other comparable regulatory authority inspection and review of a clinical trial site;\n69\n● failure of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or the clinical trial protocol or otherwise meet their contractual\nobligations in a timely manner, or at all;\n● unfavorable FDA, EMA, MHRA or other comparable regulatory authority inspection and review of manufacturing facilities or inability of those facilities to\nmaintain a compliance status acceptable to the FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authorities;\n● delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including the imposition of additional regulatory oversight around clinical testing generally\nor with respect to our therapies in particular; or\n● varying interpretations of data by the FDA, EMA, MHRA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nOur product candidates will require additional, time-consuming development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, clinical trials and approval\nby the FDA, EMA, MHRA and/or other applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical\nproduct development, including the possibility that such product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In\naddition, we cannot assure stockholders that any such products that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely\naccepted in the marketplace or be more effective than other commercially available alternatives.\nDue to the significant resources required for the development of our product pipeline, and depending on our ability to access capital, we must prioritize the\ndevelopment of certain product candidates over others. Moreover, we may fail to expend our limited resources on product candidates or indications that may have been\nmore profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe have three separate programs for producing anti-inflammatory agents: (1) investigating new clinical opportunities for anti-TNF, (2) identifying orally available,\nsmall molecules that are agonists of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and (3) identifying patentable analogs of CBD that initially will be used as pain medications, that are at\nvarious stages of preclinical development. Due to the significant resources required for the development of our product candidates, we must focus on specific diseases and\ndisease pathways and decide which product candidates to pursue and advance and the amount of resources to allocate to each. Our decisions concerning the allocation of\nresearch, development, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular product candidates or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of any\nviable commercial products and may divert resources away from better opportunities. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the viability or market potential of any of\nour product candidates or misinterpret trends in the pharmaceutical industry, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a result, we may (i) fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities, (ii) be required to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other\nproduct candidates or other diseases and disease pathways that may later prove to have greater commercial potential than those we choose to pursue, or (iii) relinquish valuable\nrights to such product candidates through collaboration, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to invest additional\nresources to retain sole development and commercialization rights.\nThe timelines of our clinical trials may be impacted by numerous factors and any delays may adversely affect our ability to execute our current business strategy.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. We may experience delays in clinical\ntrials at any stage of development and testing of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number\nof subjects, or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nEvents which may result in a delay or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials include:\n● inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n● delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n70\n● delays in reaching agreement with the FDA, MHRA or other foreign regulators on final trial design;\n● imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA, MHRA or other regulatory authorities;\n● delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n● delays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site;\n● delays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n● delays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise;\n● clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n● time required to add new clinical sites; and\n● delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver a sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials for our product candidates are delayed for any of the above reasons or for other reasons, our development costs\nmay increase, our approval process could be delayed, any periods after commercial launch and before expiration of patent protection may be reduced and our competitors may\nhave more time to bring products to market before we do. Any of these events could impair the commercial potential of our product candidates and could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nClinical trials of our product candidates may not uncover all possible adverse effects that patients may experience.\nClinical trials are conducted in representative samples of the potential patient population, which may have significant variability. Clinical trials are by design based on\na limited number of subjects and of limited duration for exposure to the product used to determine whether, on a potentially statistically significant basis, the planned safety and\nefficacy of any product candidate can be achieved. As with the results of any statistical sampling, we cannot be sure that all side effects of our product candidates may be\nuncovered, and it may be the case that only with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate for a longer duration, that a more complete safety\nprofile is identified. Further, even larger clinical trials may not identify rare serious adverse effects or the duration of such studies may not be sufficient to identify when those\nevents may occur. Patients treated with our products, if approved, may experience adverse reactions and it is possible that the FDA, MHRA or other regulatory authorities may\nask for additional safety data as a condition of, or in connection with, our efforts to obtain approval of our product candidates. If safety problems occur or are identified after\nour product candidates reach the market, we may, or regulatory authorities may require us to amend the labeling of our products, recall our products or even withdraw approval\nfor our products.\nFailure can occur at any stage of our drug development efforts.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, testing that could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for, or\ncommercializing our drug candidates, including but not limited to:\n● regulators or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n● conditions may be imposed upon us by the FDA and/or MHRA regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials, or we may be required to resubmit our clinical\ntrial protocols to IRBs for review due to changes in the regulatory environment;\n● the number of subjects required for our clinical trials may be larger, patient enrollment may take longer, or patients may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher\nrate than we anticipate;\n71\n● we may have to suspend or terminate one or more of our clinical trials if we, regulators, or IRBs determine that the participants are being subjected to\nunreasonable health risks;\n● our third-party contractors, clinical investigators or contractual collaborators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or fail to meet their contractual\nobligations to us in a timely manner;\n● the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials that are conducted at clinical sites in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the U.S.;\n● our tests may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional testing; and\n● the costs of our pre-clinical and/or clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical studies and trials, and if they do not perform their obligations to us, we may not be able to\nobtain approval for additional indications.\nWe do not currently have the ability to independently conduct pre-clinical studies or clinical studies and trials, and we have to date relied on third parties, such as third-\nparty contract research and governmental organizations and medical institutions to conduct studies and trials for us. Our reliance on third parties for development activities\nreduces our control over these activities. These third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our pre-clinical studies and our clinical studies and\ntrials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we\nmay be adversely affected, and our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize indications may be delayed.\nIf we conduct studies with other parties, we may not have control over all decisions associated with that trial. To the extent that we disagree with the other party on\nsuch issues as study design, study timing and the like, it could adversely affect our drug development plans.\nAlthough we also rely on third parties to manage the data from our studies and trials, we are responsible for confirming that each of our studies and trials is conducted\nin accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies will require us to comply with applicable regulations and\nstandards, including Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), for conducting, recording and reporting the results of such studies and trials to assure\nthat the data and the results are credible and accurate and that the human study and trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third-parties does not relieve us of\nthese obligations and requirements, and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval for any additional indications if these requirements are not met.\nWe will need to continue to develop and maintain distribution and production capabilities or relationships to be successful.\nWe may not be able to successfully manufacture any product, either independently or under manufacturing arrangements, if any, with third party manufacturers.\nMoreover, if any manufacturer should cease doing business with us or experience delays, shortages of supply or excessive demands on their capacity, we may not be able to\nobtain adequate quantities of product in a timely manner, or at all. Manufacturers, and in certain situations their suppliers, are required to comply with current NDA\ncommitments and current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements enforced by the FDA, and similar requirements of other countries. The failure by a manufacturer\nto comply with these requirements could affect its ability to provide us with products. Although we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers, we are ultimately\nresponsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMP. In addition, if, during a preapproval inspection or other inspection of our third-party\nmanufacturers’ facility or facilities, the FDA determines that the facility is not in compliance with cGMP, any of our marketing applications that lists such facility as a\nmanufacturer may not be approved or approval may be delayed until the facility comes into compliance with cGMP and completes a successful re-inspection by the FDA.\nAny manufacturing problem, natural disaster, or epidemic, affecting manufacturing facilities, or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our\noperations and result in lost sales. Additionally, we will be reliant on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our products. Any reliance on suppliers\nmay involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any\nunanticipated disruption to future contract manufacture caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of products, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost\nsales. If our suppliers were unable to supply us with adequate supply of our drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our drug\ncandidates.\n72\nIf we fail to discover, develop and commercialize other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business and our ability to achieve our strategic\nobjectives would be impaired. In addition, we may also seek to commercialize certain treatments that may not be proprietary to us.\nAlthough the development and commercialization of our current product candidates are our initial focus, as part of our long-term growth strategy, we plan to develop\nother product candidates. While we believe our planned products may have potential applicability to other uses, we have not conducted any clinical trials on these other uses\nand we may not be successful in developing product candidates for other uses. In addition, we intend to devote capital and resources for basic research to discover and identify\nadditional product candidates. These research programs require technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our\nresearch programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons,\nincluding the following:\n● the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n● competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete;\n● product candidates that we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights;\n● a product candidate may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise\ndoes not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n● a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n● a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals within the timeframes we expect, the development and commercialization of our\nproduct candidates may be delayed, and our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nFor planning purposes, we seek to estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development objectives.\nThese milestones may include our expectations regarding the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials, the submission of regulatory filings, or\ncommercialization objectives. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones, such as the completion of an ongoing clinical\ntrial, the initiation of other clinical programs, receipt of marketing approval or a commercial launch of a product. The potential achievement of many of these milestones may\nbe outside of our control. Each of these milestones is based on a variety of assumptions which, if not realized as expected, may cause the timing of such potential achievement\nof the respective milestones to vary considerably from our estimates, including:\n● our available capital resources or capital constraints we experience;\n● the rate of progress, costs and results of our clinical trials and research and development activities, including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating\nclinicians and collaborators;\n● our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria;\n● our receipt of approvals by the FDA, MHRA and other regulatory authorities and the timing thereof;\n73\n● clinical outcomes;\n● other actions, decisions or rules issued by regulators;\n● our ability to access sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates;\n● the efforts of our collaborators with respect to the commercialization of our product candidates; and\n● the securing of, costs related to, and timing issues associated with, product manufacturing as well as sales and marketing activities.\nIf we fail to achieve any announced milestones in the timeframes we expect, the development and commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed, and\nour business and results of operations may be harmed, and it could negatively impact our share price performance. Please see the section entitled “Item 1. Business” in this\nReport for more information.\nIf we rely on a sole source of supply to manufacture our products we could be impacted by the viability of our supplier.\nWe intend to attempt to source our products from more than one supplier. We also intend to enter into contracts with any supplier of our products to contractually\nobligate them to meet our requirements. However, if we are reliant on a single supplier and that supplier cannot or will not meet our requirements (for whatever reason), our\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to sufficiently scale-up manufacturing of our drug candidates.\nWe may not be able to successfully increase in a sufficient manner the manufacturing capacity for our drug candidates, whether in collaboration with third-party\nmanufacturers or on our own, in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. If a contract manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our drug\ncandidates, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to those improvements.\nSignificant scale-up of manufacturing may require additional validation studies, which are costly and which the FDA must review and approve. In addition, quality\nissues may arise during those scale-up activities because of the inherent properties of a drug candidate itself or of a drug candidate in combination with other components added\nduring the manufacturing and packaging process, or during shipping and storage of the finished product or active pharmaceutical ingredients. If we are unable to successfully\nscale-up manufacture of any of our drug candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development of that drug candidate and regulatory approval or commercial launch for\nany resulting drug products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply, which could significantly harm our business.\nOur and our partner’s operations are subject to risks associated with ongoing and potential future global conflicts, including specifically the operations of Yissum,\nour research partner.\nIn February 2022, an armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The sanctions announced by the United States and other countries against Russia and\nBelarus following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to date include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services, or technology in or from affected regions and travel bans and\nasset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business, and financial organizations in Russia and Belarus. The United States and other countries could\nimpose wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Separately, in October 2023, Israel and certain Iranian-backed Palestinian forces began an\narmed conflict in Israel, the Gaza Strip, and surrounding areas, which threatens to spread to other Middle Eastern countries including Lebanon and Iran.\nThese wars are increasingly affecting economic and global financial markets and exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including issues such as rising inflation\nand global supply-chain disruption. While we do not believe these conflicts currently have a material impact on our financial accounting and reporting, the degree to which we\nwill be affected in the future largely depends on the nature and duration of uncertain and unpredictable events, and our business could be impacted. Additionally, we currently\nhave agreements and relationships in place with Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Ltd. (“Yissum”), located in Israel, and\nYissum’s operations may be materially affected by the ongoing war in Israel, which may delay, prevent, or materially increase the cost of the ongoing services Yissum is\nrequired to provide to the Company. Furthermore, future global conflicts or wars could create further economic challenges, including, but not limited to, increases in inflation\nand further global supply-chain disruption. Consequently, the ongoing Russia/Ukraine Hamas/Israel conflicts and/or other future global conflicts, could result in an increase in\noperating expenses and/or a decrease in any future revenue and could further have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.\n74\nWe may enter into strategic transactions in the future which may result in a material change in our operations and/or a change of control.\nIn December 2023, we engaged A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners as financial advisor to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value.\nPotential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated by the Company as part of this process include, but are not limited to, an acquisition, merger, reverse merger,\nother business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other strategic transactions involving the Company. The Company does not intend to discuss or disclose further\ndevelopments during this process unless and until its Board of Directors has approved a specific action or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate. There is\nno assurance that the strategic review process will result in the approval or completion of any specific transaction or outcome.\nThe Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of the Company, its stockholders and its stakeholders. There is no deadline\nor definitive timetable set for completion of the strategic alternatives review process and there can be no assurance that this process will result in the Company pursuing a\ntransaction or any other strategic outcome.\nAs a result of the above, in the future, we may enter into transactions with parties seeking to merge and/or acquire us and/or our operations. While we have not entered\ninto any agreements or understandings with any such parties to date, in the event that we do enter into such a transaction or transactions in the future, new shares of common\nstock or preferred stock could be issued resulting in substantial dilution to our then current stockholders and/or a change of control. As a result, our new majority stockholders\nmay change the composition of our Board of Directors and may replace our current management. Any future transaction may also result in a change in our business focus. We\nhave not entered into any agreements relating to any strategic transaction involving the Company as of the date of this Report and may not enter into such agreements in the\nfuture. Any future strategic transaction involving the Company or its operations may have a material effect on our operations, cash flows, results of operations, prospects, plan\nof operations, the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, our officers, directors and majority stockholder(s), and the value of our securities.\nRisks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval of our Future Product Candidates\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, delay or termination. The results of clinical trials are open to differing\ninterpretations.\nWe have three separate programs for producing anti-inflammatory agents: (1) investigating new clinical opportunities for anti-TNF, (2) identifying orally available,\nsmall molecules that are agonists of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and (3) identifying patentable analogs of CBD that initially will be used as pain medications. However,\nthese programs, including the related clinical trials, are expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nRegulatory agencies may not accept clinical trial designs submitted by us, and may analyze or interpret the results of clinical trials differently than us. Even if the\nresults of our clinical trials are favorable, the clinical trials for a number of our future product candidates are expected to continue for several years and may take significantly\nlonger to complete. In addition, the FDA, MHRA or other regulatory authorities, including state, local and foreign authorities, or an IRB, with respect to a trial at our institution,\nmay suspend, delay or terminate our clinical trials at any time, require us to conduct additional clinical trials, require a particular clinical trial to continue for a longer duration\nthan originally planned, require a change to our development plans such that we conduct clinical trials for a product candidate in a different order, e.g., in a step-wise fashion\nrather than running two trials of the same product candidate in parallel, or could suspend or terminate the registrations and quota allotments we require in order to procure and\nhandle controlled substances, for various reasons, including the following, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations:\n● lack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials;\n75\n● discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by trial participants or other safety issues, such as drug interactions, including those\nwhich cause confounding changes to the levels of other concomitant medications;\n● slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials;\n● difficulty in retaining subjects who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw at any time due to adverse side effects from the therapy, insufficient efficacy,\nfatigue with the clinical trial process or for any other reason;\n● delays or inability in manufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials due to regulatory and manufacturing constraints;\n● inadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or product formulation;\n● delays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial, including “clinical holds” or delays requiring suspension or termination of a trial by a regulatory\nagency, such as the FDA, before or after a trial is commenced;\n● DEA related recordkeeping, reporting security or other violations at a clinical site, leading the DEA or state authorities to suspend or revoke the site’s-controlled\nsubstance license and causing a delay or termination of planned or ongoing trials;\n● changes in applicable regulatory policies and regulation, including changes to requirements imposed on the extent, nature or timing of studies;\n● delays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective clinical trial sites;\n● uncertainty regarding proper dosing;\n● delay or failure to supply product for use in clinical trials which conforms to regulatory specification;\n● unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n● failure of our CROs, or other third-party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n● failure by our company, our employees, our CROs or their employees to comply with all applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements relating to the conduct\nof clinical trials;\n● scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n● failure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n● regulatory concerns with CBD derivative products generally and the potential for abuse, despite only working with non-plant based non-psychoactive products;\n● insufficient data to support regulatory approval;\n● inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; or\n● difficulty in maintaining contact with patients during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data.\n76\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the\nspeed at which we can recruit eligible patients to participate in testing our product candidates. We have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials, and we may experience\nsimilar delays in the future. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, or termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nWe may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to\ncomplete our clinical trials within the expected timeframe. Patient enrollment can be impacted by factors including, but not limited to:\n● design and complexity and/or commitment of participation required in the study protocol;\n● size of the patient population;\n● eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n● clinical supply availability;\n● delays in participating site identification, qualification and subsequent activation to enroll;\n● perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including as a result of adverse effects observed in similar or competing therapies;\n● proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n● availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n● competition of site efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n● participating site motivation;\n● patient referral practices of physicians;\n● activities of patient advocacy groups;\n● ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n● severity of the disease under investigation.\nIn particular, each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our product candidates are diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials.\nThe eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove\ncostly. The treating physicians in our clinical trials may also use their medical discretion in advising patients enrolled in our clinical trials to withdraw from our studies to try\nalternative therapies. In addition, pandemics or epidemics may impact patient ability and willingness to travel to clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines and other\nrestrictions, which may negatively impact enrollment in our clinical trials, for example, our trials have in the past had difficulty recruiting a sufficient number of patients due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\n77\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll the required eligible patients per protocol to participate in the clinical trials required by the\nFDA or the EMA, MHRA or other regulatory agencies. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous\nrisks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n● difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with CROs and physicians;\n● different standards for the conduct of clinical trials;\n● our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners;\n● the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology products and treatment;\n● ability to procure and deliver necessary clinical trial materials needed to perform the study; and\n● inability to implement adequate training at participating sites remotely when in person training cannot be completed.\nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned\nclinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our ability to complete clinical trials and ultimately our results of operations.\nAny failure by our company to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state and foreign governments in each of the U.S., European and Canadian markets, in which we plan to sell\nour products, or in markets where we have product candidates progressing through the approval process.\nWe must adhere to all regulatory requirements including FDA’s GLP, GCP and GMP requirements, pharmacovigilance requirements, advertising and promotion\nrestrictions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and their European equivalents. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, including FDA pre-or\npost-approval requirements, then the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities could sanction our company. Even if a drug is approved by the FDA or other competent\nauthorities, regulatory authorities may impose significant restrictions on a product’s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-\nmarketing trials. Any of our product candidates which may be approved in the U.S. will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging,\nstorage, distribution, import, export, advertising, promotion, sampling, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and\nstate requirements. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and\nmanufacturing procedures conform to GMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers (in the event contract manufacturers are appointed in the future) are subject to\ncontinual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with GMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work will have to spend time, money and effort in all\nareas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, quality control and quality assurance. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and\nproduction problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. Promotional communications with respect to\nprescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product’s approved label. Similar restrictions\nand requirements exist in the EU and other markets where we operate.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the\nfacility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of the product, it may impose restrictions on that product or on our company,\nincluding requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may\nissue warning letters, impose civil or criminal penalties, suspend regulatory approval, suspend any of our ongoing clinical trials, refuse to approve pending applications or\nsupplements to approved applications submitted by us, impose restrictions on our operations, or seize or detain products or require a product recall.\n78\nIn addition, it is possible that our future products will be regulated by the DEA, under the Controlled Substances Act or under similar laws elsewhere. DEA scheduling\nis a separate process that can delay when a drug may become available to patients beyond an NDA approval date, and the timing and outcome of such DEA process is uncertain.\nSee also “Risks Related to Controlled Substances”, below.\nIn addition, any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to spend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative\npublicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our future\nproduct candidates. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our business and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nAny action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management’s\nattention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation. We expect to spend significant resources on compliance efforts and such expenses are unpredictable.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards might also create uncertainty, higher expenses and increase insurance costs. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary\nresources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment might result in increased management and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and\nattention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations and implementation of or changes to such healthcare laws and regulations could\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could\nimpact our ability to sell our future product candidates. If we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other federal, state or foreign regulations, we may be\nsubject to administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, we from federal health care programs and the restructuring of our operations.\nAny of these could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Since many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the courts, there is an\nincreased risk that we may be found in violation of one or more of their provisions. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we ultimately are successful in our\ndefense, will cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention away from the operation of our business. In addition, in many foreign countries,\nparticularly the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control.\nIn some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely\nfrom country to country.\nFor example, some EU jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been\nagreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular\nproduct candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Such\ndifferences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between EU member states. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or\nreimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in\nthe U.K. and EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. In the U.K. and EU, the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has\nbecome intense. As a result, barriers to entry of new products are becoming increasingly high and patients are unlikely to use a drug product that is not reimbursed by their\ngovernment. We may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, the importation\nof foreign products may compete with any future product that we may market, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nSpecifically, in the U.S., we expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage\ncriteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product. There have been judicial challenges to certain aspects of the ACA and\nnumerous legislative attempts to repeal and/or replace the ACA in whole or in part, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future.\nAt this time, the full effect that the ACA will have on our business in the future remains unclear. An expansion in the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may\ncause general downward pressure on the prices of prescription drug products, lower reimbursements or any other product for which we obtain regulatory approval, reduce\nproduct utilization and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a\nsimilar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate\nrevenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any of our future product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\n79\nInformation obtained from expanded access studies may not reliably predict the efficacy of our future product candidates in company-sponsored clinical trials and\nmay lead to adverse events that could limit approval.\nThe expanded access studies we are currently supporting are uncontrolled, carried out by individual investigators and not typically conducted in strict compliance with\nGCPs, all of which can lead to a treatment effect which may differ from that in placebo-controlled trials. These studies provide only anecdotal evidence of efficacy for\nregulatory review. These studies contain no control or comparator group for reference and this patient data is not designed to be aggregated or reported as study results.\nMoreover, data from such small numbers of patients may be highly variable. Information obtained from these studies, including the statistical principles that we and the\nindependent investigators have chosen to apply to the data, may not reliably predict data collected via systematic evaluation of the efficacy in company-sponsored clinical trials\nor evaluated via other statistical principles that may be applied in those trials. Reliance on such information to design our clinical trials may lead to trials that are not adequately\ndesigned to demonstrate efficacy and could delay or prevent our ability to seek approval of our future product candidates.\nExpanded access programs provide supportive safety information for regulatory review. Physicians conducting these studies may use our future product candidates in a\nmanner inconsistent with the protocol, including in children with conditions beyond those being studied in trials which we sponsor. Any adverse events or reactions experienced\nby subjects in the expanded access program may be attributed to our future product candidates and may limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval with labeling that we\nconsider desirable, or at all.\nThere is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials.\nGenerally, there is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials. We may suffer significant setbacks in our clinical trials similar to the\nexperience of a number of other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. Further, even if we view\nthe results of a clinical trial to be positive, the FDA, MHRA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of the data. In the event that we obtain negative\nresults from clinical trials for product candidates or other problems related to potential chemistry, manufacturing and control issues or other hurdles occur and our future\nproduct candidates are not approved, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain financing to continue our operations, our ability to execute on our current\nbusiness plan may be materially impaired, and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community might be significantly damaged. In addition, our inability to\nproperly design, commence and complete clinical trials may negatively impact the timing and results of our clinical trials and ability to seek approvals for our drug candidates.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state “fraud and abuse” laws or similar laws in other jurisdictions, we may be required to pay a penalty and/or be\nsuspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to various federal and state health care “fraud and abuse” laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to\nreduce fraud and abuse in federal and state health care programs, which could affect our company particularly upon successful commercialization of our products in the U.S.\nThe Medicare and Medicaid Patient Protection Act of 1987, or federal Anti-Kickback Statute, makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a\nparty acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase,\norder or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Under federal law, some\narrangements, known as safe harbors, are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with\nall applicable requirements, it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be\nchallenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions,\nincluding fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S.\ngovernment. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims\nlaws of several states.\n80\nWhile we believe that we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws, the government could allege violations of, or convict us of violating,\nthese laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be required to pay a penalty and could be suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state\nhealth care programs, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Member States of the EU and other countries also have anti-kickback laws and can impose penalties in case of infringement, which, in some jurisdictions, can also\nbe enforced by competitors.\nSerious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude, delay or limit approval of our future product candidates, limit\nthe scope of any approved label or market acceptance, or cause the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed.\nIf any of our future product candidates prior to or after any approval for commercial sale, cause serious or unexpected side effects, or are associated with other safety\nrisks such as misuse, abuse or diversion, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n● regulatory authorities may interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials;\n● regulatory authorities may deny regulatory approval of our future product candidates;\n● regulatory authorities may require certain labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications or limitations on the indications for use, and/or impose\nrestrictions on distribution in the form of a REMS in connection with approval or post-approval;\n● regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval, require more onerous labeling statements, impose more restrictive REMS, or require us to recall any product\nthat is approved;\n● we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n● our relationships with our collaboration partners may suffer;\n● we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or\n● our reputation may suffer. The reputational risk is heightened with respect to those of our future product candidates that are being developed for pediatric\nindications.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that the products present an unacceptable risk to participants, or if preliminary\ndata demonstrates that our future product candidates are unlikely to receive regulatory approval or unlikely to be successfully commercialized. Following receipt of approval\nfor commercial sale of a product, we may voluntarily withdraw or recall that product from the market if at any time we believe that its use, or a person’s exposure to it, may\ncause adverse health consequences or death. To date, we have not withdrawn, recalled or taken any other action, voluntary or mandatory, to remove an approved product from\nthe market, have not received approval for any products, and have not marketed any approved product. In addition, regulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards\nmay at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that\nthe clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Although we\nhave never been asked by a regulatory agency, IRB or data safety monitoring board to temporarily or permanently discontinue a clinical trial, if we elect or are forced to\nsuspend or terminate a clinical trial of any of our future product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product\nrevenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events may result in labeling statements such as warnings or contraindications. In addition,\nsuch events or labeling could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of\ncommercializing our future product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by our company or by our\ncollaboration partners.\n81\nThe development of REMS for our future product candidates could cause delays in the approval process and would add additional layers of regulatory\nrequirements that could impact our ability to commercialize our future product candidates in the U.S. and reduce their market potential.\nEven if the FDA approves our NDA for any of our future product candidates without requiring a REMS as a condition of approval of the NDA, the FDA may, post-\napproval, require a REMS for any of our future product candidates if it becomes aware of new safety information that makes a REMS necessary to ensure that the benefits of\nthe drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS elements can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use\n(“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special\nmonitoring and the use of patient registries. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy.\nWe may be required to adopt a REMS for our future product candidates to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks of abuse, misuse, diversion and other potential safety\nconcerns. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve a manageable REMS for our future product candidates, which could create material and significant limits on our\nability to successfully commercialize our future product candidates in the U.S. Delays in the REMS approval process could result in delays in the NDA approval process. In\naddition, as part of the REMS, the FDA could require significant restrictions, such as restrictions on the prescription, distribution and patient use of the product, which could\nsignificantly impact our ability to effectively commercialize our future product candidates, and dramatically reduce their market potential, thereby adversely impacting our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Even if initial REMS are not highly restrictive, if, after launch, our future product candidates were to be subject to\nsignificant abuse/non-medical use or diversion from illicit channels, this could lead to negative regulatory consequences, including a more restrictive REMS.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are\nultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nWe are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the U.S. without obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA. Foreign\nregulatory authorities, such as the EMA and MHRA, impose similar requirements. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is\ninherently unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including substantial discretion of\nthe regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a\nproduct candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. To date, we have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or similar drug approval submissions to\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities for our most advanced product candidate for the early stage treatment of Dupuytren’s Contracture, or any other product candidate. We\nmust complete additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans before we will be able to obtain these\napprovals.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that\nany clinical trial design that we submit will be accepted by the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or that clinical trials will be conducted as\nplanned or completed on schedule, if at all. The clinical development of our initial and potential additional product candidates is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent at any\nstage of development, including failure to demonstrate efficacy in a clinical trial or across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of adverse events that are severe or\nmedically or commercially unacceptable, failure to comply with protocols or applicable regulatory requirements, and determination by the FDA, MHRA or any other\ncomparable foreign regulatory authority that a product candidate may not continue development or is not approvable. It is possible that even if any of our product candidates\nhas a beneficial effect, that effect will not be detected during clinical evaluation as a result of one or more of a variety of factors, including the size, duration, design,\nmeasurements, conduct or analysis of our clinical trials. Conversely, as a result of the same factors, our clinical trials may indicate an apparent positive effect of such product\ncandidate that is greater than the actual positive effect, if any. Similarly, in our clinical trials, we may fail to detect toxicity of, or intolerability caused by, such product\ncandidate, or mistakenly believe that our product candidates are toxic or not well tolerated when that is not in fact the case. Serious adverse events, or SAEs, or other adverse\neffects, as well as tolerability issues, could hinder or prevent market acceptance of the product candidate at issue.\n82\nOur current and future product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n● the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n● we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and\neffective for our proposed indication;\n● the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for\napproval;\n● we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n● the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from clinical trials or preclinical studies;\n● the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA or other submission or to\nobtain regulatory approval in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere;\n● the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find deficiencies with the manufacturing processes of third-party manufacturers with\nwhich we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n● the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our\nclinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of clinical trial results may result in us failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any product\ncandidate we develop, which would substantially harm our business, results of operations and prospects. The FDA, MHRA or other comparable foreign authorities have\nsubstantial discretion in the approval process and determining when or whether regulatory approval will be granted for any product candidate that we develop. Even if we\nbelieve the data collected from future clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or any other\nregulatory authority.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we\nrequest, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may\napprove a product candidate with labeling that does not include the claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the\nforegoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nRisks Related to our Reliance Upon Third Parties\nOur existing collaboration arrangements with certain universities and any that we may enter into in the future with other partners may not be successful, which\ncould adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our future product candidates.\nWe are seeking collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of our future product\ncandidates. We may, with respect to our future product candidates, enter into new arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining commercialization\nrights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for each product candidate, both\nin the U.S. and internationally. To the extent that we decide to enter into collaboration agreements, we will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and\nthe terms of any collaboration or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\n83\nAny existing or future collaboration that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and\nactivities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.\nDisagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding development, intellectual property, regulatory or commercialization matters, can lead to delays in the\ndevelopment process or commercialization of the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be\ndifficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority. Any such termination or expiration could harm our business reputation and may adversely affect\nit financially.\nWe expect to depend on a limited number of suppliers for materials and components in order to manufacture our future product candidates. The loss of these\nsuppliers, or their failure to supply us on a timely basis, could cause delays in our current and future capacity and adversely affect our business.\nWe expect to depend on a limited number of suppliers for the materials and components required to manufacture our future product candidates. As a result, we may not\nbe able to obtain sufficient quantities of critical materials and components in the future. A delay or interruption by our suppliers may also harm our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. In addition, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy, and we may experience delays in meeting\ndemand in the event we must switch to a new supplier. The time and effort to qualify for and, in some cases, obtain regulatory approval for a new supplier could result in\nadditional costs, diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields, any of which would negatively impact our operating results. Our dependence on single-source\nsuppliers exposes us to numerous risks, including the following: our suppliers may cease or reduce production or deliveries, they may be subject to government investigations\nand regulatory actions that limit or prevent production capabilities for an extended period of time, raise prices or renegotiate terms; our suppliers may become insolvent; we\nmay be unable to locate a suitable replacement supplier on acceptable terms or on a timely basis, or at all; and delays caused by supply issues may harm our reputation, frustrate\nour customers and cause them to turn to our competitors for future needs.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our future product candidates or our proprietary technology in the marketplace.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely\nupon a combination of patents, trade secret protection (i.e., know-how), and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property of our future product candidates. The\nstrengths of patents in the pharmaceutical field involve complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain\naspects of our products and technology. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents globally can be prohibitively expensive.\nOur policy is to look to patent technologies with commercial potential in jurisdictions with significant commercial opportunities. However, patent protection may not\nbe available for some of the products or technology we are developing. If we must spend significant time and money protecting, defending or enforcing our patents, designing\naround patents held by others or licensing, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business, results of operations and financial condition\nmay be harmed. We may not develop additional proprietary products that are patentable. As of the date hereof, we have an extensive portfolio of patents, including many\ngranted patents and patents pending approval.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain. The scope and extent of patent protection for our future product candidates are particularly\nuncertain. Our future product candidates will be based on medicinal chemistry instead of cannabis plants. While we have sought patent protection, where appropriate, directed\nto, among other things, composition-of-matter for its specific formulations, their methods of use, and methods of manufacture, we do not have and will not be able to obtain\ncomposition of matter protection on these previously known CBD derivatives per se. We anticipate that the products we develop in the future will be based upon synthetic\ncompounds we may discover. Although we have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection in the U.S., Europe and other countries for our proprietary technologies,\nfuture product candidates, their methods of use, and methods of manufacture, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection. If any of our products are\napproved and marketed for an indication for which we do not have an issued patent, our ability to use our patents to prevent a competitor from commercializing a non-branded\nversion of our commercial products for that non-patented indication could be significantly impaired or even eliminated.\n84\nPublication of information related to our future product candidates by our company or others may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to these\nproducts and product candidates. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights. In\naddition, any of our issued patents may be opposed and/or declared invalid or unenforceable. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may face competition\nfrom companies who attempt to create a generic product to compete with our future product candidates. We may also face competition from companies who develop a\nsubstantially similar product to our future product candidates that is not covered by any of our patents.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems\nof certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to\npharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf third parties claim that intellectual property used by our company infringes upon their intellectual property, our operating profits could be adversely affected.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the U.S., involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. We\nmay, from time to time, be notified of claims that we are infringing upon patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties, and we\ncannot provide assurances that other companies will not, in the future, pursue such infringement claims against us, our commercial partners or any third-party proprietary\ntechnologies we have licensed. If we were found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property right, or if we failed to obtain or renew a license under a patent or other\nintellectual property right from a third party, or if a third party from whom we were licensing technologies was found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property\nrights of another third party, we may be required to pay damages, including damages of up to three times the damages found or assessed, if the infringement is found to be\nwillful, suspend the manufacture of certain products or reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible, or we may be unable to enter certain new product markets. Any such\nclaims could also be expensive and time consuming to defend and divert management’s attention and resources. Our competitive position could suffer as a result. In addition, if\nwe have declined or failed to enter into a valid non-disclosure or assignment agreement for any reason, we may not own the invention or our intellectual property, and our\nproducts may not be adequately protected. Thus, we cannot guarantee that any of our future product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe\non any third party’s intellectual property.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be\nsignificantly diminished.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade\nsecrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with current and former employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored\nresearchers, contract manufacturers, vendors and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent\ndisclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, we cannot\nguarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets. Any party with whom we or they have executed such\nan agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such\nbreaches.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Also,\nsome courts inside and outside the U.S. are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed\nby a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they disclose such trade secrets, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If\nany of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, our competitive position would be harmed.\n85\nThe expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely affect our future revenues and operating earnings.\nWe rely on patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of our product candidates.\nIn particular, patent protection is important in the development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates. Patents covering our product candidates normally\nprovide market exclusivity, which is important in order to improve the probability that our product candidates are able to become profitable.\nOne of our patents relating to our Fibrosis and anti-TNF program will expire in 2033; however, the majority of the patent portfolio has a longer lifespan. While we are\nseeking additional patent coverage which may protect the technology underlying these patents, there can be no assurances that such additional patent protection will be granted,\nor if granted, that these patents will not be infringed upon or otherwise held enforceable. Even if we are successful in obtaining a patent, patents have a limited lifespan. In the\nU.S., the natural expiration of a utility patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it\naffords, is limited. Without patent protection of our product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such methods and compositions.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments by extending the patent term, our business may be harmed.\nOur commercial success will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property in the U.S. and other countries with respect to\nour product candidates. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting our product\ncandidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates begin to be commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the U.S. and, if available, in other\ncountries where we are prosecuting patents.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited\npatent term extension, or PTE, under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman\nAmendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent as compensation for patent term lost during development and the\nFDA regulatory review process, which is limited to the approved indication (and potentially additional indications approved during the period of extension) covered by the\npatent. This extension is limited to only one patent that covers the approved product, the approved use of the product, or a method of manufacturing the product. However, the\napplicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the U.S., and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether\nsuch extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. We may not be granted an extension\nbecause of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable\nrequirements. Moreover, the applicable time-period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. Even if we are able to obtain an extension, the\npatent term may still expire before or shortly after we receive FDA marketing approval. If we are unable to extend the expiration date of our existing patents or obtain new\npatents with longer expiry dates, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical\ndata to obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nRisks Related to Controlled Substances\nControlled substance legislation differs between countries, and legislation in certain countries may restrict or limit our ability to sell our future product\ncandidates.\nMost countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, which governs international trade\nand domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to\nus obtaining marketing approval for our future products in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations\nto permit our future products to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In that case, we would be unable\nto market our future product candidates in those countries in the near future or perhaps at all.\n86\nThe product candidates that we are developing may be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations and failure to comply with these laws and\nregulations, or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations, both during clinical development and\npost approval, and our financial condition.\nThe product candidates that we are developing may contain controlled substances as defined in The United States Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the\nCSA. Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain\nregistration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled\nsubstances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, no currently “accepted medical use”\nin the U.S., lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the U.S. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the\nU.S. which contain a controlled substance are listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence\nand Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.\nWhile cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, products approved for medical use in the U.S. that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts should be placed in\nSchedules II-V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the “accepted medical use” requirement. If and when any of our future product candidates receive FDA approval, the DEA\nwill make a scheduling determination. If the FDA, the DEA or any foreign regulatory authority determines that our future product candidates may have potential for abuse, it\nmay require us to generate more clinical or other data than we currently anticipate to establish whether or to what extent the substance has an abuse potential, which could\nincrease the cost and/or delay the launch of that product.\nFacilities conducting research, manufacturing, distributing, importing or exporting, or dispensing controlled substances must be registered (licensed) to perform these\nactivities and have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All these facilities must\nrenew their registrations annually, except dispensing facilities, which must renew every three years. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments\nthat handle controlled substances. Obtaining the necessary registrations may result in delay of the importation, manufacturing or distribution of our future products.\nFurthermore, failure to maintain compliance with the CSA, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings\nto restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.\nIndividual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Although state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states\nare separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule our future product candidates as well. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain\nfederal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our partners must also obtain\nseparate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet\napplicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nBecause our products may be controlled substances in the U.S., to conduct clinical trials in the U.S., each of our research sites must submit a research protocol to the\nDEA and obtain and maintain a DEA researcher registration that will allow those sites to handle and dispense our products and to obtain product from our importer. If the DEA\ndelays or denies the grant of a research registration to one or more research sites, the clinical trial could be significantly delayed, and we could lose clinical trial sites. The\nimporter for the clinical trials must also obtain an importer registration and an import permit for each import.\n87\nThe legislation on cannabis in the EU differs among the member states, as this area is not yet fully harmonized. In Germany, for example, cannabis is regulated as a\ncontrolled substance (Betäubungsmittel) and its handling requires specific authorization.\nThe legalization and use of medical and recreational cannabis in the U.S. and abroad may impact our business.\nThere is a substantial amount of change occurring in the U.S. regarding the use of medical and recreational cannabis products. While cannabis products not approved\nby the FDA are Schedule I substances as defined under federal law, and their possession and use is not permitted according to federal law (except for research purposes, under\nDEA registration), according to the website worldpoplulationreview.com, at least 38 states and the District of Columbia have enacted state laws to enable possession and use of\ncannabis for medical purposes, and at least 19 states and the District of Columbia for recreational purposes. The U.S. Farm Bill, which was passed in 2018, descheduled certain\nmaterial derived from hemp plants with extremely low THC content. Although our business is quite distinct from that of online and dispensary cannabis companies, future\nlegislation authorizing the sale, distribution, use, and insurance reimbursement of non-FDA approved cannabis products could affect our business.\nAccounting Risks\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, impair long-lived assets and intangible assets, including goodwill and acquired in-process research and development.\nWe review long-lived assets and certain identifiable assets (including intangible assets) for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is\nan indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. An impairment exists when the carrying value of the long-lived or intangible asset (including goodwill and\nacquired in-process research and development) is not recoverable and exceeds its estimated fair value. Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the\nfair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. We review goodwill yearly, or more frequently whenever circumstances and situations change such that\nthere is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered, for impairment by initially considering qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. If\nit is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative analysis is performed to identify goodwill\nimpairment.\nOur publicly-traded stock closed at $1,482.00 per share as of December 31, 2021; during 2022, the market value of our single reporting unit significantly declined. As\nof March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the market value of our publicly-traded stock fell to $984.20, $322.24, $252.70 and $64.41, per\nshare, respectively, and as such, we elected to conduct a quantitative analysis of goodwill to assess for impairment as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. We\ndetermined the fair market value of our single reporting unit and compared that value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit and determined that goodwill was impaired\nas of both measurement dates. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value exceeded the fair market value by $18,872,850 and $14,674,428,\nrespectively. To recognize the impairment of goodwill, we recorded losses for these amounts at the end of the third and fourth quarters, which appear as a loss on goodwill\nimpairment of $33,547,278 on the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIntangible assets and in-process research and development (“IP R&D”) assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that were acquired on July 16, 2019 in\nconnection with the Reorganization, which have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. IP R&D assets are considered to be indefinite-lived\nuntil the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. During the period that the IP R&D assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are\ntested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IP\nR&D assets are less than their carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon regulatory approval, and we are able to commercialize\nproducts associated with the IP R&D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If\ndevelopment is terminated or abandoned, we may record a full or partial impairment charge related to the IP R&D assets, calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the IP\nR&D assets over their estimated fair value.\n88\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet was $12,405,084 (which consists of carrying value of $1,462,084 and\n$10,943,000 related to the Company’s CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). Per the valuation obtained from a third party as of year-end, the fair\nmarket value of the Company’s IP R&D assets was determined to be $9,063,000 (which consists of fair market values of $0 and $9,063,000 related to the Company’s CBR\nPharma subsidiary and 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). As of this measurement date, the carrying value of the CBR Pharma and 180 LP subsidiaries’ assets exceeded their fair\nmarket values by $1,462,084 and $1,880,000, respectively. As such, management determined that the consolidated IP R&D assets were impaired by $3,342,084, and in order to\nrecognize the impairment, the Company recorded a loss for this amount during the fourth quarter of 2022, which appears as a loss on impairment of IP R&D assets on the\nincome statement. This reduced the IP R&D asset balances of its CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary to zero and $9,063,000, respectively, as of December 31,\n2022; the total consolidated IP R&D asset balance is $9,063,000 after impairment.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet was $9,063,000 (which consists of a balance related to the Company’s 180\nLP subsidiary); the Company typically assesses asset impairment on an annual basis unless a triggering event or other facts or circumstances indicate that an evaluation should\nbe performed at an earlier date. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the Company assessed general economic conditions, industry and market considerations, the Company’s\nfinancial performance and all relevant legal, regulatory, and political factors that might indicate the possibility of impairment and concluded that, when these factors were\ncollectively evaluated, it was likely that the asset was impaired. The Company recorded a loss in the amount of $9,063,000, which appeared as a loss on impairment to IP R&D\nassets on the income statement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet is $0.\nAn impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period, even if the value of our common stock increases in the future. We have in the\npast and could in the future incur additional impairments of long-lived assets and/or intangible assets, including acquired in-process research and development and goodwill,\nwhich may be material.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, identify material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. If\nnot remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material\nmisstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and the trading price of our securities.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that\nthe financial information we report contains material errors. A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in\nthe normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis.\nMaintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial\nstatements and we are committed to remediating our material weaknesses in such controls as promptly as possible. However, there can be no assurance as to when these\nmaterial weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development\nof new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our\nreporting and financial obligations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our\noperations or may lose confidence in our reported financial information. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and Nasdaq,\nwe could face severe consequences from those authorities. Any of these cases could result in a material adverse effect on our business, on our financial condition or have a\nnegative effect on the trading price of our common stock and warrants. Further, if we fail to remedy any future deficiencies or maintain the adequacy of our disclosure controls\nand procedures and our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation against us or our management.\n89\nWe can give no assurance that the measures we would take in the future will remediate any additional material weaknesses which could be identified, or restatements\nof our financial statements will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of those\ncontrols.\nFurther, in the future, if we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm\nis unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (to the extent we may be required in the future), investors\ncould lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also\nsubject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the SEC or Nasdaq, as applicable, or other regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, even if we would be successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify\nirregularities or facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements or our periodic reports filed with the SEC. This may require us to restate prior financial statements.\nWe may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations.\nOur implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported\nfinancial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Warrants\nThe market price of our common stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These\nfactors include, without limitation:\n● “short squeezes”;\n● comments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media;\n● large stockholders exiting their position in our securities or an increase or decrease in the short interest in our securities;\n● actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;\n● changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n● the commencement, enrollment or results of our planned or future clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n90\n● the success of competitive drugs or therapies;\n● regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries;\n● the success of competitive products or technologies;\n● developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n● the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n● the level of expenses related to our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n● litigation matters, including amounts which may or may not be recoverable pursuant to our officer and director insurance policies, regulatory actions affecting the\nCompany and the outcome thereof;\n● the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates;\n● actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n● our inability to obtain or delays in obtaining adequate drug supply for any approved drug or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n● disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n● significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n● variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n● changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems, including coverage and adequate reimbursement for any approved drug;\n● market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n● general economic, political, and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the financial markets in the U.S. and abroad; and\n● investors’ general perception of us and our business.\nStock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, during 2022, the closing sales prices of our common stock ranged from a\npost-split adjusted high of $1,482.04 per share to a low of $23.56 per share and during fiscal 2023, the closing sales prices of our common stock ranged from a high of $100.70\nper share to a low of $3.21 per share. During this time, we do not believe that we have experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that\nwould explain such price volatility or trading volume; however, we have sold equity which was dilutive to existing stockholders. These broad market fluctuations may\nadversely affect the trading price of our securities. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our\ncommon stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively\naffect the liquidity of our common stock.\n91\nInformation available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media may include\nstatements not attributable to us and may not be reliable or accurate.\nWe are aware of a large volume of information being disseminated by third parties relating to our operations, including in blogs, message boards and social and other\nmedia. Such information as reported by third parties may not be accurate, may lead to significant volatility in our securities and may ultimately result in our common stock or\nother securities declining in value.\nThe exercise of our outstanding options and warrants, and the sale of common stock upon exercise thereof, may adversely affect the trading price of our\nsecurities.\nAs of March 20, 2024, we had (i) outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of 17,788 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of\n$633.95 per share; and (ii) outstanding warrants to purchase 983,473 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $83.97 per share (when not including the\n275,205 pre-funded warrants). For the life of the options and warrants, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without\nassuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot\npredict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect, if any, that\nfuture issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common\nstock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, the common stock issuable upon exercise/conversion of outstanding convertible securities may represent overhang that may also adversely affect the\nmarket price of our common stock. Overhang occurs when there is a greater supply of a company’s stock in the market than there is demand for that stock. When this happens\nthe price of our stock will decrease, and any additional shares which stockholders attempt to sell in the market will only further decrease the share price. If the share volume of\nour common stock cannot absorb shares sold by holders of our outstanding convertible securities, then the value of our common stock will likely decrease.\nOur outstanding public warrants are significantly out of the money.\nEach Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-seven hundred sixtieth of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per 1/760th of one share\n($4,370.00 per whole share), subject to adjustment. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants became exercisable 12\nmonths from the closing of the IPO and expire five years after the completion of the Business Combination (November 6, 2025). The Public Warrants are significantly out of\nthe money and because no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants, the Public Warrants are only exercisable in multiples of 760. As a result, the\nPublic Warrants may not have any significant value. Additionally, warrant holders not holding at least 760 Public Warrants or who hold Public Warrants which would be\nexercisable for a fractional share of common stock, must sell any warrants to obtain value from the fractional interest. As a result, the trading of the Public Warrants may be\nlimited or sporadic, and such Public Warrants may not have any significant value. Any holder of Public Warrants holding less than 760 Public Warrants or a number of Public\nWarrants not evenly divisible by 760 will not receive any common stock upon the exercise of Public Warrants, as no fractional shares of common stock are issuable upon\nexercise thereof.\n92\nA significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock and cause significant\ndilution to existing stockholders.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Most of our common stock is\navailable for immediate resale in the public market, including (a) options to purchase 17,788 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $633.95 per\nshare; and (b) warrants to purchase 987,473 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $83.97 per share (such amount does not include 257,205 pre-\nfunded warrants which were outstanding as of December 31, 2023, all of which have been exercised as of March 7, 2024). If a significant number of shares were sold, such\nsales would increase the supply of our common stock, thereby potentially causing a decrease in its price. The exercise of outstanding convertible securities will also cause\nsignificant dilution to existing stockholders and will likely cause the per-share value of our common stock to decline, possibly significantly. Some or all of our shares of\ncommon stock may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to effective registration statements and/or compliance with Rule 144, which sales could have a\ndepressive effect on the market for our shares of common stock. Subject to certain restrictions, a person who has held restricted shares for a period of six months may generally\nsell common stock into the market. The sale of a significant portion of such shares when such shares are eligible for public sale may cause the value of our common stock to\ndecline in value.\nThere may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their shares. The market price of our common stock may\ncontinue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock will likely continue to be highly volatile. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common stock\nare beyond our control, such as conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common stock. This situation is attributable to a number of factors,\nincluding the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that\ngenerate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company\nsuch as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable.\nAs a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a mature issuer which\nhas a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. It is possible that a broader or more active\npublic trading market for our common stock will not develop or be sustained, or that trading levels will not continue. These factors may materially adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock, regardless of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility\nhas significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These\nbroad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe face significant penalties and damages in the event registration statements we have previously filed to register certain securities sold in our prior offerings are\nsubsequently suspended or terminated.\nPursuant to certain prior private offerings of securities, we entered into registration rights agreements which required us to file certain registration statements to\nregister the resale of the privately sold shares and certain securities issuable upon exercise/conversion thereof, and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statements\nfor certain periods of time. To date, all such required registration statements have been declared effective by the SEC. However, in the event the registration statements are\nsubsequently suspended or terminated, or we otherwise fail to meet certain requirements set forth in the registration rights agreements, we could be required to pay significant\npenalties which could adversely affect our cash flow and cause the value of our securities to decline in value.\nProvisions of certain outstanding warrants could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nProvisions of certain outstanding warrants could make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. Certain outstanding warrants prohibit us from\nengaging in certain transactions constituting “fundamental transactions” unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under each of the outstanding\nwarrants issued in connection with the July 2022 Offering, the December 2022 Offering, the April 2023 Offering and August 2023 Offering (each as defined and/or discussed\nherein), and the outstanding December 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants and December 2023 Common Warrants, respectively. Further, such outstanding warrants provide that, in the\nevent of certain transactions constituting “fundamental transactions,” with some exception, holders of such warrants will have the right, at their option, to require us to\nrepurchase such warrants at a price described in the applicable warrants (based on the Black Scholes Value of such warrants). These and other provisions of the warrants could\nprevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to stockholders.\n93\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the\nprice of our common stock to decline.\nWe may issue additional common stock, convertible securities, or other equity in the future. We also issue common stock to our employees, directors, and other service\nproviders pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. New investors in such\nissuances could also receive rights senior to those of current stockholders.\nResales of our common stock in the public market may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could occur at any time. The issuance of new shares of our common stock could result in resales of our\ncommon stock by our current stockholders concerned about the potential ownership dilution of their holdings. In turn, these resales could have the effect of depressing the\nmarket price for our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The\nperception in the public market that our stockholders might sell shares of our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. Up to $125,000,000 in\ntotal aggregate value of securities have been registered by us on a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 that we filed with the Commission on June 3, 2022, and which was\ndeclared effective on June 24, 2022. However, as of the date of this Report, our public float was less than $75 million, and under SEC regulations for so long as our public float\nremains less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using our shelf registration statement on Form\nS-3 is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float. At such time as our public float again exceeds $75 million, the number of securities we may sell under a Form S-3\nregistration statement will no longer be limited by such rules. Additionally, if our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common\nstock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. The market price for shares of our common stock may drop significantly when\nsuch securities are sold in the public markets. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional\nshares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nRisks Associated with Our Governing Documents and Delaware Law\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limits their liability, which may result in a major cost to\nus and hurt the interests of our stockholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers or directors.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides for indemnification as follows: “To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation is authorized to provide\nindemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, such agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to which Delaware law permits the Corporation to provide\nindemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the\nindemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, subject only to limits created by applicable Delaware law\n(statutory or non-statutory), with respect to actions for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and others.”\nWe have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the\nSecurities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws, other than the payment by us of\nexpenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by a director, officer or controlling\nperson in connection with our activities, we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent) submit to a court of appropriate\njurisdiction, the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.\nThe legal process relating to this matter if it were to occur is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity, either of which factors is likely to\nmaterially reduce the market and price for our shares.\n94\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains a specific provision that limits the liability of our directors for monetary damages to us and our stockholders and\nrequires us, under certain circumstances, to indemnify officers, directors and employees.\nThe limitation of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights to them may result in\nsubstantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains a specific provision that limits the liability of our directors for monetary damages to us and our stockholders. We also have\ncontractual indemnification obligations under our employment and engagement agreements with our executive officers and directors. The foregoing indemnification obligations\ncould result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup.\nThese provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly\ndiscourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers, even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our\nstockholders.\nOur directors have the right to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and additional shares of our common stock.\nOur directors, within the limitations and restrictions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and without further action by our stockholders, have the authority to\nissue shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to fix the number of shares and the relative rights, conversion rights, voting rights, and terms of\nredemption, liquidation preferences and any other preferences, special rights and qualifications of any such series. Any issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely\naffect the rights of holders of our common stock. Should we issue additional shares of our common stock at a later time, each investor’s ownership interest in our stock would\nbe proportionally reduced.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, as well\nas provisions of Delaware law, might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading\nprice of our common stock.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that\nmay discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might\notherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock or warrants. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove\nour management. Our corporate governance documents include the following provisions:\n● a classified board of directors, as a result of which our Board is divided into two classes, with each class serving for staggered two-year terms;\n● the removal of directors only for cause;\n● requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to\nour Board;\n● prohibiting stockholders’ ability to take action via written consents to action;\n● providing that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, or the Board pursuant to a resolution\nadopted by a majority of the Board;\n● authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; and\n● limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers.\n95\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the\nability of stockholders holding shares representing more than 15% of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock from engaging in certain business combinations with us.\nAny provision of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended or our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect\nof delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the\nprice that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our\ncommon stock or warrants. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock\nor warrants in an acquisition.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, contains exclusive forum provisions that may discourage lawsuits against us and\nour directors and officers.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended provides that unless the corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action\nasserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder of the Company to us or our stockholders, (iii) any\naction asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws,\nor (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThe choice of forum provision in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation does not waive our compliance with our obligations under the federal\nsecurities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Moreover, the provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or by\nthe Securities Act. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the\nrules and regulations thereunder, and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts with respect to suits brought to enforce a duty or\nliability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain claims under the Securities\nAct.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with\nus or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find one or more of these exclusive\nforum provisions inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs\nassociated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions or forums, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, contains provisions whereby we renounced any interest in any corporate opportunity\noffered to any director or officer, subject to certain exceptions.\nOur Section Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides that to the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any\nother analogous doctrine, does not apply with respect to us or any of our officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, and that we renounce any expectancy that any\nof our directors or officers will offer any such corporate opportunity of which he or she may become aware to us, except that the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply\nwith respect to any of our directors or officers only with respect to a corporate opportunity (i) that was offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as our director or\nofficer, (ii) that is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and (iii) to the extent the director or officer is\npermitted to refer such opportunity to us without violating any legal obligation.\nAdditionally, each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities\npursuant to which such officer or director may be required to present a business opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under applicable law.\nAccordingly, there may arise conflicts of interest in whether to present a potential business combination opportunity to our company. These conflicts may not be resolved in our\nfavor. Our renouncement of corporate opportunities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations moving forward and/or create conflicts of interest or\nperceived conflicts of interest which may have a material adverse effect on the value of our securities.\n96\nOur directors allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs.\nOur directors are not required to, and do not, commit their full time to our affairs, and certain of our directors hold positions, including other directorships, with other\ncompanies in the life sciences industry, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and others which they provide services to. If\nour directors’ other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to\ndevote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our operations. Additionally, such persons may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various\nbusiness activities. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. Additionally, our directors, because of our corporate opportunity waiver, discussed above, may choose to,\nor be required to, provide corporate opportunities to the other companies which they are affiliated with. Actual or perceived conflicts of interest may have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations which may have a material adverse effect on the value of our securities.\nCompliance, Reporting and Listing Risks\nWe incur significant costs to ensure compliance with U.S. and Nasdaq reporting and corporate governance requirements.\nWe incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with applicable U.S. and Nasdaq corporate governance requirements,\nincluding requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq. The rules of Nasdaq include requiring us to maintain\nindependent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. All of such SEC and Nasdaq obligations require a\ncommitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management’s time and attention from our\nday-to-day operations. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities\nmore time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer\nliability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it\nmay be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board or as executive officers.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a reporting company, and given our limited capital resources, such additional costs may have an adverse impact on\nour profitability.\nWe are an SEC-reporting company. The rules and regulations under the Exchange Act require reporting companies to provide periodic reports with interactive data\nfiles, which require that we engage legal, accounting and auditing professionals, and eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and EDGAR (Electronic Data\nGathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) service providers. The engagement of such services can be costly, and we may continue to incur additional losses, which may adversely\naffect our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the SEC, have required\nchanges in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies. For example, as a result of being a reporting company, we\nare required to file periodic and current reports and other information with the SEC and we have adopted policies regarding disclosure controls and procedures and regularly\nevaluate those controls and procedures.\nThe additional costs we continue to incur in connection with being a reporting company (expected to be several hundred thousand dollars per year) will continue to\nfurther stretch our limited capital resources. Due to our limited resources, we have to allocate resources away from other productive uses in order to continue to comply with\nour obligations as an SEC reporting company. Further, there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient resources to continue to meet our reporting and filing obligations with\nthe SEC as they come due.\n97\nWe are not in compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, may not be able to comply with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards in the future, and\nas a result our common stock and warrants may be delisted from Nasdaq.\nOur common stock and Public Warrants trade on Nasdaq under the symbols “ATNF” and “ATNFW,” respectively. Notwithstanding such listing, there can be no\nassurance any broker will be interested in trading our securities. Therefore, it may be difficult to sell our securities publicly. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to\nmaintain our listings on Nasdaq for any period of time by perpetually satisfying Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements.\nOn September 7, 2023, the Company received written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the\nCompany that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the\nminimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company’s\ncommon stock for the thirty (30) consecutive business days from July 26, 2023 to September 6, 2023, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement.\nThe notification letter stated that the Company has 180 calendar days or until March 5, 2024, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain\ncompliance, the bid price of the Company’s common stock must have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. If the\nCompany does not regain compliance by March 5, 2024, an additional 180 days may be granted to regain compliance, so long as the Company meets The Nasdaq Capital\nMarket initial listing criteria (except for the bid price requirement) and notifies Nasdaq in writing of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by\neffecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company does not qualify for the second compliance period or fails to regain compliance during the second 180-day period,\nthe Company’s common stock will be subject to delisting, at which point the Company would have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel.\nThe Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with\nthe minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, including affecting a reverse stock split. The Company held a special stockholders’ meeting on February\n16, 2024, to seek approval, for among other things, an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split\nof our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, by a ratio of between one-for-four to one-for-forty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be\ndetermined by our Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof in its discretion, at any time after approval of the amendment and prior to February 16, 2025. On\nFebruary 16, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock in the amount of one-for-nineteen,\nwhich was effective on February 28, 2024. On March 13, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it has regained full compliance with the\nminimum bid price for continued listing on Nasdaq, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), because Nasdaq has determined that for 10 consecutive business days, the\nclosing bid price of the Company’s common stock was at or above $1.00 per share.\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the shareholder approval\nrequirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), which require prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving the issuance of 20% or\nmore of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the applicable Minimum Price (as defined in Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)).\nThe Staff’s determination under Listing Rule 5635(d) relates to the offering and issuance by the Company of an aggregate of: (i) 35,102 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock, at a price of $12.35 per share, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 207,814 shares of common stock, at a price of $12.3481 per pre-funded warrant and\n(iii) warrants to purchase up to 242,915 shares of common stock. The offering price per share and associated common warrant was $12.35 and the offering price per pre-funded\nwarrant and associated common warrant was $12.3481.\nThe Staff determined that the offering was not a “public offering” for the purposes of Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules due to the type of offering, a best efforts\noffering pursuant to a placement agency agreement, and the fact that one investor purchased 98% of the offering. As a result, because the offering represented greater than 20%\nof the common stock outstanding and was priced below the Minimum Price, the Staff determined that the Company was required to obtain prior shareholder approval under\nListing Rule 5635(d).\n98\nThe October 11, 2023 letter provided the Company 45 days to submit a plan to regain compliance. The plan of compliance was subsequently submitted by the\nCompany to Nasdaq on November 9, 2023, and on November 14, 2023, Nasdaq granted the Company an extension, until December 15, 2023, to complete certain transactions\nset forth in the plan of compliance, in order to remedy its prior violation of Nasdaq rules as described in the October 11, 2023 letter from Nasdaq.\nThe Company undertook several transactions in November and December 2023, including amending the terms of the warrants discussed above, to not be exercisable\nuntil the Company’s stockholders approve such issuance in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, in order to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)).\nAs a result of those transactions, on December 14, 2023, Nasdaq provided the Company written notice that the Company has complied with the terms of the prior\nextension; that the Company complies with Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)); and that the matter is now closed.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity\nrequirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Rule”) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to\nmaintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000. In the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company reported a\nstockholders’ deficit of ($149,327), which is below the minimum stockholders’ equity required for continued listing pursuant to the Rule. Additionally, the Company does not\nmeet the alternative Nasdaq continued listing standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nNasdaq provided the Company until January 2, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance. We submitted the plan to regain compliance in a timely manner,\nand on January 11, 2024, Nasdaq advised the Company that it has determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with the Rule.\nThe terms of the extension are as follows: on or before May 13, 2024, the Company must complete certain transactions described in greater detail in the compliance\nplan, contemplated to result in the Company increasing its stockholders’ equity to more than $2.5 million, and opt for one of the two following alternatives to evidence\ncompliance with the Rule: Alternative 1: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available report (e.g., a Form 8-K) including: 1. A disclosure of the\nStaff’s deficiency letter and the specific deficiency(ies) cited; 2. A description of the completed transaction or event that enabled the Company to satisfy the stockholders’\nequity requirement for continued listing; and 3. An affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, the Company believes it has regained compliance with the\nstockholders’ equity requirement based upon the specific transaction or event referenced in Step 2; or Alternative 2: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a\npublicly available report including: 1. Steps 1 & 2 set forth above; 2. A balance sheet no older than 60 days with pro forma adjustments for any significant transactions or event\noccurring on or before the report date; and 3. That the Company believes it satisfies the stockholders’ equity requirement as of the report date. The pro forma balance sheet must\nevidence compliance with the stockholders’ equity requirement.\nAdditionally, in either case the Company is required to disclose that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company’s ongoing compliance with the stockholders’ equity\nrequirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting.\nRegardless of which alternative the Company chooses, if the Company fails to evidence compliance upon filing its next periodic report with the SEC following the end\nof such compliance period (i.e., its Quarterly Report for the Quarter ended June 30, 2024), the Company may be subject to delisting. In the event the Company does not satisfy\nthese terms, Nasdaq will provide written notification that its securities will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal Nasdaq’s determination to a Hearings Panel.\nThe Company is currently evaluating various courses of action to regain compliance and is hopeful that it can regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum\nstockholders’ equity standard within the compliance period. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the transactions contemplated in the\ncompliance plan, which the Company expects will allow it to regain compliance with the Rule, or that such transactions will result in the Company regaining compliance with\nthe Rule, within the compliance period granted by Nasdaq, if at all.\n99\nAmong the conditions required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq requires us to maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders’ equity or\n$500,000 in net income over the prior two years or two of the prior three years. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, our stockholders’ equity was below $2.5\nmillion and we did not otherwise meet the net income requirements described above, and as such, we are not currently in compliance with Nasdaq’s continue listing standards\nrelating to minimum stockholders’ equity. If we fail to timely remedy our compliance with such applicable requirement, our common stock and Public Warrants may be\ndelisted.\nOur failure to meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements for the reasons above, or any other reason, may result in our securities being delisted from Nasdaq.\nAdditional conditions required for continued listing on Nasdaq include requiring that we have a majority of independent directors, a two-person compensation\ncommittee and a three-member audit committee (each consisting of all independent directors). As a result, our common stock and Public Warrants may be delisted from\nNasdaq.\nEven if we demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq, we will have to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing requirements to continue\nto be listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading our common stock and Public Warrants more difficult for investors,\npotentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or\npurchase of our common stock and Public Warrants, the sale or purchase of our common stock and Public Warrants would likely be made more difficult, and the trading volume\nand liquidity of our common stock and Public Warrants could decline. Delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it\nmore difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by\nother parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could\nseverely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and Public Warrants and the ability of our stockholders and warrant holders to sell our common stock and Public\nWarrants in the secondary market. If our common stock and Public Warrants are delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock and Public Warrants may be eligible to trade on an\nover-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB Market or the OTC Pink market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our common stock and Public\nWarrants or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock and Public Warrants. In the event our common stock and Public Warrants is delisted from\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on an over-the counter quotation system.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the\nfuture for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests.\nThese provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of our Board to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make it more\ndifficult for the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control of the Company. Together, these provisions may make it\nmore difficult for the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our\nsecurities.\n100\nOur proprietary information, or that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, may be lost or we may suffer security breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we expect to collect and store sensitive data, including valuable and commercially sensitive intellectual property, clinical trial\ndata, our proprietary business information and that of our future customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers, clinical\ntrial subjects and employees, patients, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our\noperations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error,\nmalfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any\nsuch access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory\npenalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and our ability to conduct clinical trials, which could adversely affect\nour business and reputation and lead to delays in gaining regulatory approvals for our future product candidates. Although we maintain business interruption insurance\ncoverage, our insurance might not cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nFailure of our information technology systems, including cybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, could significantly disrupt the operation of our\nbusiness.\nOur business increasingly depends on the use of information technologies, which means that certain key areas such as research and development, production and sales\nare to a large extent dependent on our information systems or those of third-party providers. Our ability to execute our business plan and to comply with regulators’\nrequirements with respect to data control and data integrity, depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems, or IT\nsystems and the IT systems supplied by third-party service providers. As information systems and the use of software and related applications by our company, our business\npartners, suppliers, and customers become more cloud-based, there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, including more sophisticated and\ntargeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information.\nIn addition, our IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters.\nMoreover, despite network security and backup measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar\ndisruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we and our third-party service providers have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT\nsystems, a successful cybersecurity attack or other data security incident could result in the misappropriation and/or loss of confidential or personal information, create system\ninterruptions, or deploy malicious software that attacks our systems. It is also possible that a cybersecurity attack might not be noticed for some period of time. In addition,\nsustained or repeated system failures or problems arising during the upgrade of any of our IT systems that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data, and in particular to\noperate our proprietary technology platform, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The occurrence of a cybersecurity attack or incident could result in\nbusiness interruptions from the disruption of our IT systems, or negative publicity resulting in reputational damage with our stockholders and other stakeholders and/or\nincreased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. In addition, the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or\nconfidential information could expose us or other third–parties to regulatory fines or penalties, litigation and potential liability, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may acquire other companies which could divert our management’s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our\noperations and harm our operating results.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our product offerings, enhance our technical\ncapabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in\nidentifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the\nacquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition or realize anticipated cost savings or\nsynergies. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n● incurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n101\n● diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;\n● unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n● harm to our existing business relationships with collaboration partners as a result of the acquisition;\n● harm to our brand and reputation;\n● the potential loss of key employees;\n● use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n● use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results arising from the impairment assessment\nprocess. Acquisitions may also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an\nacquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we make acquisitions in the future, funding permitting, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired\ncompany’s assets, personnel and operations with our own. We do not anticipate that any acquisitions or mergers we may enter into in the future would result in a change of\ncontrol of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core\nbusiness. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and\nincrease our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n● the difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;\n● the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n● difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n● the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n● the potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross-marketing of the products to new and existing customers;\n● the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired;\n● potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the\nmarketing and sales of acquired products or operations, or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company\nprior to our acquisition; and\n● potential expenses under the labor, environmental and other laws of various jurisdictions.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection\nwith an acquisition, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees,\nincrease our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\n102\nWe may apply working capital and future funding to uses that ultimately do not improve our operating results or increase the value of our securities.\nIn general, we have complete discretion over the use of our working capital and any new investment capital we may obtain in the future. Because of the number and\nvariety of factors that could determine our use of funds, our ultimate expenditure of funds (and their uses) may vary substantially from our current intended operating plan for\nsuch funds.\nWe intend to use existing working capital and future funding for research and development, and general corporate purposes, including the potential expenses related to\ncompleting a reverse merger and legal expenses. We will also use capital for general working capital purposes. However, we do not have more specific plans for the use and\nexpenditure of our capital. Our management has broad discretion to use any or all of our available capital reserves. Our capital could be applied in ways that do not improve our\noperating results or otherwise increase the value of a stockholder’s investment.\nWe have never paid or declared any dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid or declared any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock. Likewise, we do not anticipate paying, in the near future, dividends or\ndistributions on our common stock. Any future dividends on common stock will be declared at the discretion of our Board and will depend, among other things, on our\nearnings, our financial requirements for future operations and growth, and other facts as we may then deem appropriate. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on\nour common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock.\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common\nstock.\nWherever possible, our Board will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will\nconsist of restricted shares of our common stock or where shares are to be issued to our officers, directors and applicable consultants. Our Board of Directors has authority,\nwithout action or vote of the stockholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in\nthe issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain\nexceptions), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock,\npossibly at a discount to market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, which may further dilute common stock book value,\nand that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be\nissued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nIn order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will need to continue to depend on our relationships with third parties, including our technology providers.\nIdentifying partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be effective in providing\nincentives to third parties to favor their products or services, or utilization of, our products and services. In addition, acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result\nin a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to\ncompete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these\nrelationships will result in increased customer use of our products or increased revenue.\n103\nClaims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to, and expect to continue to be regularly subject to, actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings. In\naddition, we have filed lawsuits against certain parties for matters we discovered which related to KBL, prior to the Business Combination. Any of these types of proceedings\nmay have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. Our current\nlegal proceedings are described under, and incorporated by reference in, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings”. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to\nsignificant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves and possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and\nunpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should\nany of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could require us to make substantial\nfuture payments, prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring\ndevelopment of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq\nand other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws,\nregulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business,\ninvestments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and results of operations.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to\nthose conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nOur executive officers and directors are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in business activities similar to those that are conducted\nby us. Our officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe\ncertain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business opportunity should be presented to our\ncompany or to another entity. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential opportunity may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our\nCertificate of Incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to\nsuch person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would\notherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or\nfinancial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a strategic\ntransaction with a target business that is affiliated with our directors or executive officers. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for\ntheir own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. Certain of our\nofficers and directors hold positions with companies which may be competitors of us. See also the biographies of our officers and directors incorporated by reference herein\nbelow under “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance”.\n104\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, COVID-19 spread to other parts of the\nword, including the U.S. and Europe, and efforts to contain its spread have intensified, with varying degrees of success. As a result, businesses have closed and limits have been\nplaced on travel and everyday activities. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot\nbe predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the U.S. and other countries, business closures or business\ndisruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the U.S. and other countries to contain and treat the disease. Should the COVID-19 pandemic continue, our plans could be\ndelayed or interrupted. The spread of COVID-19 has also created global economic uncertainty, which may cause partners, suppliers and potential customers to closely monitor\ntheir costs and reduce their spending budget. The foregoing could materially adversely affect the clinical trials, supply chain, financial condition and financial performance of\nour company.\nEnrollment of patients in our clinical trials, maintaining patients in our ongoing clinical trials, doing follow up visits with recruited patients and collecting data have\nbeen, and may continue to be, delayed or limited as certain of our clinical trial sites limit their onsite staff or temporarily close as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and\nongoing government restrictions. In addition, patients may not be able or willing to visit clinical trial sites for dosing or data collection purposes due to limitations on travel and\nphysical distancing imposed or recommended by federal or state governments or patients’ reluctance to visit the clinical trial sites during the pandemic. These factors resulting\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic could delay or prevent the anticipated readouts from our clinical trials, which could ultimately delay or prevent our ability to generate revenues\nand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The foregoing could materially adversely affect the clinical trials, supply chain, financial condition and\nfinancial performance of our company.\nAdditionally, our Frozen Shoulder trial has been adversely affected. The trial was opened to recruitment at the end of May 2022 following delays in gaining approvals\ndue to backlogs in the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) system due to COVID-19 and consequential staff vacancies. Nine participants were recruited for\nparticipation in the trial through mid-February 2023. The U.K. research system has faced unprecedented challenges following the COVID-19 pandemic both in terms of support\nservices and at the point of delivery of clinical care. This has resulted in the NIHR instituting their Recovery and Reset program to identify and close trials that are facing\nchallenges. Our Frozen Shoulder trial was considered to be one of such trials, due to the considerable challenges we faced to open recruitment sites and enroll sufficient\nparticipants. Therefore, the NIHR has asked the chief investigators to close the trial for further recruitment. This closure or future closures or difficulties relating to the\nrecruitment of participants in future studies could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete studies, the timeline for future drugs and our ability to generate\nrevenues and support our operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change.\nThe long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict; however, such effects may be widespread. Impacts from climate change may include physical risks\n(such as rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions-which may affect our current operations due to among other things, the fact that a majority of\nour operations we are based in California, which is prone to inclement weather), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being),\ncompliance costs and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes) and other adverse effects. The effects of climate change could increase the cost of certain\nproducts, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business. Climate\nchange could also lead to increased costs as a result of physical damage to or destruction of our facilities, loss of inventory, and business interruption due to weather events that\nmay be attributable to climate change. These events and impacts could materially adversely affect our business operations, financial position or results of operation.\nEnvironmental, social and governance matters may impact our business and reputation.\nGovernmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees are increasingly sensitive to environmental,\nsocial and governance, or ESG, concerns, such as diversity and inclusion, climate change, water use, recyclability or recoverability of packaging, and plastic waste. This focus\non ESG concerns may lead to new requirements that could result in increased costs associated with developing, manufacturing and distributing our products. Our ability to\ncompete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for more environmentally friendly products, packaging or\nsupplier practices, or by failure to meet such customer expectations or demand. We risk negative stockholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as\ndamage to our brand and reputation, if we do not act responsibly, or if we are perceived to not be acting responsibly in key ESG areas, including equitable access to medicines,\nproduct quality and safety, diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency, and addressing human\ncapital factors in our operations. If we do not meet the ESG expectations of our investors, customers and other stakeholders, we could experience reduced demand for our\nproducts, loss of customers, and other negative impacts on our business and results of operations.\n105\nThe U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU could result in increased regulatory and legal complexity, which may make it more difficult for us to do business in the U.K.\nand/or Europe and impose additional challenges in securing regulatory approval of our product candidates in the U.K. and/or Europe.\nThe U.K.’s exit from the EU as of January 31, 2020, with a transitional period up to December 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit”, has caused political and\neconomic uncertainty, including in the regulatory framework applicable to our operations and product candidates in the U.K. and the EU, and this uncertainty may persist for\nyears. Brexit could, among other outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the EU, and result in increased legal and regulatory\ncomplexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. As one of the Brexit consequences, the EMA has relocated from the U.K. to the Netherlands.\nThis has led to a significant reduction of the EMA workforce, which has resulted and could further result in significant disruption and delays in its administrative procedures,\nsuch as granting clinical trial authorization or opinions for marketing authorization, disruption of importation and export of active substance and other components of new drug\nformulations, and disruption of the supply chain for clinical trial product and final authorized formulations.\nThe cumulative effects of the disruption to the regulatory framework may add considerably to the development lead time to marketing authorization and\ncommercialization of products in the EU and/or the U.K. It is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, which can disrupt the timing of our clinical trials and\nregulatory approvals. In addition, changes in, and legal uncertainty with regard to, national and international laws and regulations may present difficulties for our clinical and\nregulatory strategy. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our\nproduct candidates in the U.K. and/or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenues and achieve and sustain profitability.\nIn addition, as a result of Brexit, other European countries may seek to conduct referenda with respect to their continuing membership with the EU. Given these\npossibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the absence of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of\nthe U.K. from the EU will have, how such withdrawal will affect us, and the full extent to which our business could be adversely affected.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges to our business.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about pharmaceutical companies’ research, product candidates, and the diseases such product candidates are\nbeing developed to prevent. Social media practices in the pharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution\ncreates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business, resulting in potential regulatory actions against us. For example, subjects may use\nsocial media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical trial or to report an alleged adverse event. When such events occur, there is a risk that we\nfail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations, or we may not be able to defend our business or the public’s legitimate interests in the face of\nthe political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our investigational product candidates. There is also a risk of\ninappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social media or networking website. Certain data protection\nregulations, such as the GDPR, apply to personal data contained on social media. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable\nregulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions or incur harm to our business, including damage to our reputation.\n106\nWe may incur indebtedness in the future which could reduce our financial flexibility, increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations and our costs.\nWe may incur significant amounts of indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n● a significant portion of our cash flows is required to be used to service our indebtedness;\n● a high level of debt increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n● covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness limit our ability to borrow additional funds and provide additional security\ninterests, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n● a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, may be able to take advantage\nof opportunities that our indebtedness may prevent us from pursuing; and\n● debt covenants may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry.\nA high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the principal or\ninterest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. If we do not have sufficient funds and are\notherwise unable to arrange financing, we may have to sell significant assets or have a portion of our assets foreclosed upon which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards.\nOur consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”),\nwhich periodically is revised or reinterpreted. From time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies,\nincluding the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the SEC. It is possible that future accounting standards may require changes to the accounting treatment in\nour consolidated financial statements and may require us to make significant changes to our financial systems. Such changes might have a materially adverse impact on our\nfinancial position or results of operations.\nFor all of the foregoing reasons and others set forth herein, an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY.\nThe Company understands the importance of preventing, assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. Consultants\nspecializing in cybersecurity risk were engaged to assess, identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats separately from the Company’s other risk assessment processes.\nThe cybersecurity risks assessed include operational risks, fraud, disaster recovery, and violation of data privacy or security laws. The assessment includes cybersecurity threats\nassociated with the use of third-party service providers.\nAs a result of the cybersecurity risk assessment performed, the Company has implemented certain enhancements to cybersecurity processes and controls. This includes\nformal monitoring of capital equipment, verifying data encryption and security updates are in place, and enhancing the security of data sharing and transmission. Additional\nrecommendations were made by the consultants, but due to budget constraints they are being considered for future enhancement.\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the heading “Failure of our information technology\nsystems, including cybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, could significantly disrupt the operation of our business”, included as part of our risk factor disclosures\nat Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our CFO is responsible for the oversight of\nrisks from cybersecurity threats, having prior experience managing business risks including those related to cybersecurity. The Board receives information and updates\nperiodically with respect to the effectiveness of our cybersecurity and information security framework, data privacy and risk management. The Board will also be provided\nupdates on any material incidents relating to information systems security and cybersecurity incidents. Although management and the Board will be made aware of\ncybersecurity incidents that could materially impact the Company, formal monitoring of all cybersecurity incidents is planned for future implementation.\nAs of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, there have been no cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected the Company’s business strategy, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\n107\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nThe Company’s headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California. The Company believes its existing leased office space is suitable for the conduct of its business. We\nbelieve that this arrangement is suitable for the conduct of our business, but we will secure a physical location for our operations if and when we believe that it becomes\nnecessary.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, we may be a party to litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business.\nSuch current litigation or other legal proceedings are described in, and incorporated by reference in, this “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K from, “Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies”, under the heading “Litigation and Other Loss Contingencies”, in the consolidated financial statements included herein\nbeginning on page F-1. The Company believes that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition or results of operations. However, assessment of the current litigation or other legal claims could change in light of the discovery of facts not presently\nknown to the Company or by judges, juries or other finders of fact, which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation\nor claims.\nAdditionally, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in\nexcess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNot applicable.\n108\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock and warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “ATNF” and “ATNFW,” respectively.\nHolders\nAs of March 19, 2024, there were 852,758 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by 71 holders of record, and 180,828 shares of common stock\nunderlying 11,500,000 public warrants outstanding to purchase shares of our common stock. Each public warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one-seven hundred\nsixtieth of one share of our common stock at a price of $5.75 per 1/760th of one share or $4,370 per whole share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time\ncommencing on December 6, 2020 (30 days after our initial business combination) and ending on November 6, 2025 (five years after our initial business combination), at 5:00\np.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. If a warrant holder holds 760 warrants, such warrants will be exercisable for one share of our common\nstock. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants and warrants must be exercised for whole shares only.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we\nwill retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the\ndiscretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize\nany future gains on their investments.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThe Company has not sold any equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and through the date of this report, except as has been previously\nincluded in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or in a Current Report on Form 8-K, except as described below:\nOn March 12, 2024, a holder of Class K Special Voting Shares converted such shares into 14 shares of common stock of the Company in a transaction exempt from\nregistration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. As a result of such conversion, there are no longer any Class K Special Voting Shares.\n109\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nSpecial Voting Shares\nWe have two classes of preferred stock designated, named our Class C Special Voting Shares and our Class K Special Voting Shares (collectively, the “Special Voting\nShares”), with the rights and preferences specified below.\nThe Special Voting Shares have a par value of $0.0001 per share. The rights and preferences of each Special Voting Shares consists of the following:\n● the right to vote in all circumstances in which our common stock have the right to vote, with the common stock as one class;\n● the Special Voting Shares entitle the holder Odyssey Trust Company (the Trustee) to an aggregate number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock\nthat were issuable to the holders of the previously outstanding shares of CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC and/or Katexco Purchaseco ULC, Canadian subsidiaries of\n180 (the “Exchangeable Shares”);\n● the holder of the Special Voting Shares (and, indirectly, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares) has the same rights as the holders of the common stock as to\nnotices, reports, financial statements and attendance at all stockholder meetings;\n● no entitlement to dividends;\n● the holder of the Special Voting Shares is not entitled to any portion of any related distribution upon windup, dissolution or liquidation of the Company; and\n● the Company may cancel the Special Voting Shares when there are no Exchangeable Shares outstanding and no option or other commitment of CannBioRex\nPurchaseco ULC and Katexco Purchaseco ULC which could require either CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC and Katexco Purchaseco ULC to issue more\nExchangeable Shares.\nAs set forth above, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, through the applicable Special Voting Share, have voting rights and other attributes corresponding to the\ncommon stock. The Exchangeable Shares provide an opportunity for certain former Canadian resident holders of CBR Pharma or Katexco securities to obtain a deferral of\ntaxable capital gains for Canadian income tax purposes in connection with the Reorganization.\nAs of the date of this Report, there are no Class C Special Voting Shares or Class K Special Voting Shares outstanding.\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\n110\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of 180 Life Sciences Corp. as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements that are included elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains statements that are forward-looking. See “Cautionary\nStatement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” above. Actual results could differ materially because of the factors discussed in “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual\nReport, and other factors that we may not know.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $127,343,657 and a working capital deficit of $1,422,710, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, a\nnet loss of $19,935,112 and cash used in operating activities of $10,922,223. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company\nwill continue as a going concern. As we are not generating revenues, we need to raise a significant amount of capital in order to pay our debts and cover our operating costs.\nWhile the Company raised capital in July 2022, December 2022, April 2023, August 2023 and November 2023, there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional\nneeded capital or that such capital will be available under favorable terms.\nWe are subject to all the substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the absence of a\nlong-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating losses until we can successfully implement our business\nstrategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. We may never ever achieve profitable operations or generate significant revenues.\nWe currently have a minimum monthly cash requirement spend of approximately $350,000. We believe that in the aggregate, we will require significant additional\ncapital funding to support and expand the research and development and marketing of our products, fund future clinical trials, repay debt obligations, provide capital\nexpenditures for additional equipment and development costs, payment obligations, office space and systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs until\nour planned revenue streams from products are fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs, if ever.\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations with the proceeds from equity and debt financing. We have experienced liquidity issues due to, among other\nreasons, our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the issuance of equity and promissory notes that are convertible into\nshares of our common stock to fund our operations and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that exposure. We anticipate that we will need to issue equity to fund our\noperations and repay our outstanding debt for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to achieve operational profitability, or we are not successful in securing other forms of\nfinancing, we will have to evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash. Our current cash balance is only expected to be sufficient to fund\nour planned business operations through approximately May 2024. If additional capital is not available, we may not be able to pursue our planned business operations, may be\nforced to change our planned business operations, or may take other actions that could adversely impact our stockholders, including seeking bankruptcy protection.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America\non a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the consolidated financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to\ncontinue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus also include a going concern footnote.\nAdditionally, wherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-\ncash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has\nauthority, without action or vote of the shareholders, but subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which\nwould result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock),\nto issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to\nraise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing\nshareholders, may further dilute the common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to\nmaintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\n111\nOrganization of MD&A\nOur Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (the “MD&A”) is provided in addition to the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. MD&A is organized as follows:\n● Business Overview and Recent Events. A summary of the Company’s business and certain material recent events.\n● Significant Financial Statement Components. A summary of the Company’s significant financial statement components.\n● Results of Operations. An analysis of our financial results comparing the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n● Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our balance sheets and cash flows and discussion of our financial condition.\n● Critical Accounting Estimates. Accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported\nfinancial results and forecasts.\nBusiness Overview and Recent Events\nThis MD&A and the related financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily cover the operations of 180, which is a clinical stage biotechnology\ncompany headquartered in Palo Alto, California, focused on the development of therapeutics for unmet medical needs in chronic pain, inflammation, fibrosis and other\ninflammatory diseases, where anti-TNF therapy will provide a clear benefit to patients, by employing innovative research, and, where appropriate, combination therapy. We\nhave three product development platforms:\n● fibrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”);\n● drugs which are derivatives of cannabidiol (“CBD”); and\n● alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (“α7nAChR”).\nDue to restrictions in the Company’s resources, the Company has not made progress in the α7nAChR platform and has suspended further research and development\nactivity in the meantime.\nWe have several future product candidates in development, including one product candidate which has recently completed a successful Phase 2b clinical trial in the\nUnited Kingdom for Dupuytren’s Contracture, a condition that affects the development of fibrous connective tissue in the palm of the hand. 180 was founded by several world-\nleading scientists in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors.\nWe intend to invest resources to successfully complete the clinical programs that are underway, discover new drug candidates, and develop new molecules to build up\non our existing pipeline to address unmet clinical needs. The product candidates are designed through a platform comprised of defined unit operations and technologies. This\nwork is performed in a research and development environment that evaluates and assesses variability in each step of the process to define the most reliable production\nconditions.\nWe may rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) and other third parties for the manufacturing and processing of the product candidates in\nthe future. We believe the use of contract manufacturing and testing for the first clinical product candidates is cost-effective and has allowed us to rapidly prepare for clinical\ntrials in accordance with our development plans. We expect that third-party manufacturers will be capable of providing and processing sufficient quantities of these product\ncandidates to meet anticipated clinical trial demands.\n112\nSignificant Financial Statement Components\nResearch and Development\nTo date, 180’s research and development expenses have related primarily to discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical development of its three product platforms:\n(1) fibrosis and anti-TNF, (2) drugs which are derivatives of CBD, and (3) α7nAChR (currently suspended). Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs\nassociated with those three product platforms, which include:\n● expenses incurred under agreements with 180’s collaboration partners and third-party contract organizations, investigative clinical trial sites that conduct research\nand development activities on its behalf, and consultants;\n● costs related to production of clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers;\n● laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of preclinical and clinical trials;\n● employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; and\n● facilities and other expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation and amortization expense and other supplies.\nWe expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We accrue for costs incurred as services are provided by monitoring the\nstatus of each project and the invoices received from our external service providers. We adjust our accrual as actual costs become known. When contingent milestone payments\nare owed to third parties under research and development arrangements or license agreements, the milestone payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are\nachieved.\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development\ncosts than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that research and development\nexpenses will increase over the next several years as clinical programs progress and as we seek to initiate clinical trials of additional product candidates. It is also expected that\nincreased research and development expenses will be incurred as additional product candidates are selectively identified and developed. However, it is difficult to determine\nwith certainty the duration and completion costs of current or future preclinical programs and clinical trials of product candidates.\nThe duration, costs, timing of clinical trials, and development of product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n● per patient trial costs;\n● the number of patients that participate in the trials;\n● the number of sites included in the trials;\n● the countries in which the trials are conducted;\n113\n● the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;\n● the number of doses that patients receive;\n● the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n● potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n● the impact of COVID-19 on the length of our trials;\n● the duration of patient follow-up; and\n● the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidates.\nIn addition, the probability of success for each product candidate will depend on numerous factors, including competition, manufacturing capability, and commercial\nviability. We will determine which programs to pursue and fund in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an assessment of each\nproduct candidate’s commercial potential.\nBecause the product candidates are still in clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts\nnecessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Due to the early-stage\nnature of these programs, we do not track costs on a project-by-project basis. As these programs become more advanced, we intend to track the external and internal cost of\neach program.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other staff-related costs, including stock-based compensation for shares of common stock issued\nand options granted to founders, directors, and personnel in executive, commercial, finance, accounting, legal, investor relations, facilities, business development, and human\nresources functions that include vesting conditions.\nOther significant general and administrative costs include costs relating to facilities and overhead costs, legal fees relating to corporate and patent matters, litigation,\nSEC filings, insurance, investor relations costs, fees for accounting and consulting services, and other general and administrative costs. General and administrative costs are\nexpensed as incurred, and we accrue amounts for services provided by third parties related to the above expenses by monitoring the status of services provided and receiving\nestimates from our service providers and adjusting our accruals as actual costs become known.\nIt is expected that the general and administrative expenses will increase over the next several years to support our continued research and development activities,\nmanufacturing activities, potential commercialization of our product candidates and the increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases are anticipated to\ninclude increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel, developing commercial infrastructure, fees to outside consultants, lawyers and accountants, and increased\ncosts associated with being a public company, as well as expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and SEC requirements,\ninsurance and investor relations costs.\n114\nOther Income\nOther income primarily represents fees earned for research and development work performed for other companies, some of which are related parties.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense related to debt instruments.\nLoss on Goodwill Impairment\nLoss on goodwill impairment represents an excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair market value during the reporting period which is not\nrecoverable.\nLoss on IP R&D assets impairment\nLoss on IP R&D assets impairment represents an excess of the carrying value of the assets over its estimated fair market value during the reporting period which is not\nrecoverable.\nChange in Fair Value of IR R&D assets\nChange in fair value of IP R&D assets represents the non-cash change in fair value of the assets during the reporting period.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities represents the non-cash change in fair value of derivative liabilities during the reporting period. Gains resulting from\nchange in fair value of derivative liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were driven by decreases in stock price during the period, resulting in a lower\nfair value of the underlying liability.\nGain on Issuance of Common Stock for Services\nThe gain on issuance of common stock for services represents the excess of the price per share paid for services rendered over the fair market value of the shares on\nthe date they were issued.\n115\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating Expenses:\nResearch and development $ 2,303,751 $ 2,191,834\nResearch and development – related parties 480,777 240,731\nGeneral and administrative 10,646,417 15,459,788\nGeneral and administrative – related parties 46,555 5,612\nTotal Operating Expenses 13,477,500 17,897,965\nLoss From Operations (13,477,500) (17,897,965)\nOther (Expense) Income:\nOther income 21,074 -\nInterest expense (44,828) (28,175)\nInterest income – related parties - 1,508\nLoss on goodwill impairment - (33,547,278)\nLoss on IP R&D assets impairment (9,063,000) (3,342,084)\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities 75,323 15,144,986\nGain on issuance of common stock for services 204,405 -\nTotal Other Expense, Net (8,807,026) (21,771,043)\nLoss Before Income Taxes (22,284,526) (39,669,008)\nIncome tax benefit 2,349,414 942,749\nNet Loss $ (19,935,112) $ (38,726,259)\nResearch and Development\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred research and development expenses of $2,303,751 compared to $2,191,834 incurred for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, representing an increase of $111,917 or 5%. The change is attributable to a decrease in the R&D Tax credit, which increased research and development\nexpenses in the current period by approximately $400,000; there were also net increases of approximately $370,000 in expenses incurred by Oxford University. These increases\nwere offset by i) reductions in salaries and bonuses of approximately $570,000 due to reductions/terminations and ii) decreases in fees paid to the Scientific Advisory Board of\napproximately $90,000.\nResearch and Development – Related Parties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred research and development expenses – related parties of $480,777 compared to $240,731 incurred for the year\nended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of $240,046 or 100%. The change is attributable to a decrease in the R&D Tax credit, which increased research and\ndevelopment expenses by approximately $125,000, as well as an increase of approximately $200,000 in consulting fees. These increases were offset by a reduction in stock-\nbased compensation of approximately $80,000.\nGeneral and Administrative\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $10,646,417 compared to $15,459,788 incurred for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, representing a decrease of $4,813,371 or 31%. The change resulted from reductions in legal expenses, insurance expenses, accrued bonuses and stock-\nbased compensation expenses of approximately $2.8 million, $800,000, $700,000 and $500,000, respectively.\n116\nGeneral and Administrative – Related Parties\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred general and administrative expenses – related parties of $46,555 compared to $5,612 incurred for the year\nended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of $40,943, or 730%. The increase is primarily related to an increase in related party consulting expenses of $41,000.\nOther Expenses, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred other expenses, net of $8,807,026 compared to $21,771,043 for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nrepresenting a decrease in other expenses of $12,964,017 or 60%. The decrease in expenses was primarily because of i) an impairment to goodwill in the prior year of\n$33,547,278 (see Note 5 - Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, to the consolidated financial statements included herein), offset by ii) a decrease in\nimpairment to IP R&D assets in the current year from the prior year of $5,720,916, and iii) a decrease in the current year from the prior year in the change in fair value of\nderivative liabilities of $15,069,663.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had cash balances of $1,975,799 and $6,970,110, respectively, and a working capital deficit of $1,422,710 and working capital\nof $3,270,608, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash used in operating activities was $10,922,223 and $12,127,585, respectively. Our cash used in operations for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $19,935,112, adjusted for non-cash expenses in the aggregate amount of $9,026,993, as well as\n$14,101 of net cash used in changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. A significant portion of the non-cash expenses during the year relates to $9.1 million of non-\nrecurring expenses associated with the impairment of IP R&D assets (see Note 5 – Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets, to the consolidated financial\nstatements included herein). Our cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to our net loss of $38,726,259, adjusted for non-cash\nexpenses in the aggregate amount of $23,876,048, as well as $2,722,626 of net cash used in changes in the levels of operating assets and liabilities. A significant portion of the\nnon-cash expenses during the year relates to $36.9 million of non-recurring expenses associated with the impairment of goodwill and IP R&D assets (see Note 5 – Intangible\nAssets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets, to the consolidated financial statements included herein), offset by changes in fair value of derivative liabilities of $15,144,986 for\nthe year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no cash provided by investing activities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash provided by financing activities was $5,907,887 and $10,873,606, respectively. Cash provided by financing\nactivities during the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily comprised of i) proceeds from the sale of common stock and common stock warrants from the April and\nAugust 2023 Offerings of $5,999,488 and ii) proceeds from the repricing of pre-funded warrants and common warrants from the August 2023 Offering of $830,769, partially\noffset by iii) aggregate offering costs paid in connection with our April and August 2023 Offerings and the repricing of the August 2023 Offering of $634,816, as well as iv)\nproceeds from and repayments of loans of $969,322 and $1,257,389, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was\nprimarily comprised of i) proceeds from the sale of July 2022 common stock and common stock warrants of $6,499,737, ii) proceeds from the sale of December 2022 common\nstock and common warrants of $5,999,851 and iii) proceeds from loans payable of $1,060,890, partially offset by iv) offering costs paid in connection with our July 2022 and\nDecember 2022 Offerings of $529,982 and $484,991, respectively, and v) repayments of loans payable and loans payable – related parties of $1,591,035 and $81,277,\nrespectively.\nOur product candidates may never achieve commercialization and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We expect that our\nresearch and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase. As a result, until such time, if ever, as we are able\nto generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including\npotentially collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if\naccomplished, may result in dilution to our then stockholders. Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-\nparty clinical research and development services, license payments or milestone obligations that may arise, laboratory and related supplies, clinical costs, potential\nmanufacturing costs, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs.\n117\nOur material cash requirements and time periods of such requirements from known contractual and other obligations include milestone and royalty payments related to\nlicense agreements with Oxford University and Yissum, payments related to the D&O insurance, payments to consultants and payments related to outside consulting firms,\nsuch as legal counsel, auditors, accountants, etc. These cash requirements, in the aggregate, amount to approximately $6,000,000 for 2024 and $38,000,000 for the years 2025\nthrough 2028.\nFurther, our operating plans may change, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials and other research\nand development activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the\ndevelopment and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with\nour current and anticipated product development programs.\nWe have not yet achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur cash outflows from operations. It is expected that our research and development and general and\nadministrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will eventually need to raise additional capital to fund our operations. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfunds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms.\nOur operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working capital and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe conditions outlined above indicated that there was a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statement issuance\ndate. However, in July 2022, December 2022, April 2023, August 2023 and November 2023, the Company raised additional capital of approximately $6.0 million, $5.5 million,\n$2.7 million, $2.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and with current cash on hand of approximately $0.8 million as of March 18, 2024, the Company expects to be able to\ncontinue as a going concern through May 2024.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.\nGAAP”), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nRecent Financings\nJuly 2022 Offering\nOn July 17, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of\n9,211 shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,927 shares of common stock (“July 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants”), and common stock\nwarrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 16,138 shares of common stock (the “July 2022 Common Warrants”), at a combined purchase price of $402.80 per share and warrant\n(the “July 2022 Offering”).

Aggregate gross proceeds from the August 2023 Offering were $2,999,606. Net proceeds to the Company from the offering,\nafter deducting the placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $2.7 million. The placement agent fees and\noffering expenses of approximately $300,000 were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The August 2023 Offering closed on August 14, 2023.\nAmendment to August 2023 Offering\nOn October 11, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq, stating that Nasdaq had determined that the Company failed to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder\napproval requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5635(d), which requires prior shareholder approval for transactions, other than public offerings, involving the issuance of 20%\nor more of the pre-transaction shares outstanding at less than the Minimum Price. The letter from Nasdaq referred to the August 2023 Offering and requested the Company to\nsubmit a plan of compliance no later than November 27, 2023. On November 9, 2023, the Company submitted a plan of compliance to Nasdaq, and on November 14, 2023,\nNasdaq provided a letter of extension to the Company.\nPursuant to the compliance plan submitted to Nasdaq, on November 28, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the August 2023 Offering (“Amendment to\nthe August 2023 Offering”), whereby (i) the Purchaser agreed to pay an additional $830,769 in connection with the repricing of the August Shares and August Pre-Funded\nWarrants (the “Repricing Amount”), (ii) the Company agreed to issue to the Purchaser additional pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 257,205 shares of common stock, with\nan exercise price of $0.0019 per share (the “Additional Pre- Funded Warrants”), and warrants to purchase up to 477,058 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of\n$3.23 per share (the “Additional Common Warrants”, collectively the “Additional Warrants”), and (iii) the Company and the Purchaser agreed to enter into the warrant\namendment agreement.

The placement agent fees and offering expenses of approximately $60,000 were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in\ncapital. The Amendment to the August 2023 Offering closed on December 1, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of its assets, liabilities, revenue\nand expenses. The Company has identified certain estimates as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its past or present results of operations related to in-\nprocess research and development (“IP R&D”). These estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact,\non the Company’s consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. The Company believes that\nthe estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made.\nHowever, actual results may differ from those estimates, and these differences may be material.\n119\nIn-Process Research and Development\nThe Company has a significant amount of IP R&D assets that are assessed at least annually for impairment. The impairment analyses of these assets are considered\ncritical because of their significance to the Company. Intangible assets arising from business combinations or acquisitions, such as IP R&D assets are initially recorded at\nestimated fair value. IP R&D assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects.\nThe Company is required to assess IP R&D assets at least annually, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates it is more likely than\nnot the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit was less than its carrying value. In assessing IP R&D assets for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors\nto determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nIP R&D Assets Impairment\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet was $12,405,084 (which consists of carrying value of $1,462,084 and\n$10,943,000 related to the Company’s CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). Per the valuation obtained from a third party as of year-end, the fair\nmarket value of the Company’s IP R&D assets was determined to be $9,063,000 (which consists of fair market values of $0 and $9,063,000 related to the Company’s CBR\nPharma subsidiary and 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). As of this measurement date, the carrying value of the CBR Pharma and 180 LP subsidiaries’ assets exceeded their fair\nmarket values by $1,462,084 and $1,880,000, respectively. As such, management determined that the consolidated IP R&D assets were impaired by $3,342,084 and, in order to\nrecognize the impairment, the Company recorded a loss for this amount during the fourth quarter of 2022, which appears as a loss on impairment of IP R&D assets on the\nincome statement. This reduced the IP R&D asset balances of its CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary to zero and $9,063,000, respectively, as of December 31,\n2022; the total consolidated IP R&D asset balance was $9,063,000 after impairment.\n120\nDuring 2023, the Company assessed the most recent delays in its commercialization timeline, general economic conditions, industry and market considerations, the\nCompany’s financial performance and all relevant legal, regulatory, and political factors that might indicate the possibility of impairment and concluded that, when these factors\nwere collectively evaluated, it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The Company recorded a loss in the amount of $9,063,000, which appeared as a loss on\nimpairment to IP R&D assets on the income statement. As a result, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet became $0 (nil) as of December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, as a result of the write-off of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet and the loss on impairment to IP R&D assets on the income statement, the Company\nrecorded a decrease in its deferred tax liability relating to the impairment of the IP R&D assets of $2.3 million as income tax benefit relating to impairment of the IP R&D\nassets in the same amount on the income statement (see Note 5 – Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets, to the consolidated financial statements included\nherein, for further information).\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements included within this Annual Report for a summary of recently issued\nand adopted accounting pronouncements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nPursuant to Item 305 of Regulation S-K (§ 229.305(e)), the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a “smaller reporting\ncompany,” as defined by Rule 229.10(f)(1), however, the Company has provided the following information below relating to interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. As of December 31, 2023, we had\n$1,975,799 in cash and cash equivalents. We intend to hold our cash in interest-bearing money market accounts. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity,\nwhich is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Due to the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents and the low risk profile of its investments, an\nimmediate 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash equivalents.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA.\nThe information required by this Item is included in this Report as set forth in the “Index to Consolidated Financial Statements” which appears on page F-1 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, after the signature pages of this Report, and is incorporated by reference herein.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\n121\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act as of December 31, 2023. Based on such evaluation,\nthe principal executive officer and the principal financial officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of 180 Life Sciences Corp. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in\nExchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be\neffective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods\nare subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the\nannual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a company with limited accounting resources, a significant amount of\nmanagement’s time and attention has been and will be diverted from our business to ensure compliance with these regulatory requirements.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting\ncompany, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies.\nManagement of 180 Life Sciences Corp., including our principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in “Internal\nControl - Integrated Framework” (2013).\nManagement concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023, based on those criteria.\n122\nRemediation Of Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company had previously reported, as of December 31, 2022, that it had identified the following material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting:\n● The Company’s review and control procedures did not operate at the appropriate level of precision to detect an error in fair value of warrants related to a one-time\nreverse stock split and the fair value of IP R&D assets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has taken corrective action and/or placed in operation, controls to address the material weakness described\nabove, including implementing a detailed fluctuations/variance analysis for income statement items, as well as adding a layer of review to SEC reporting. We have performed\nthe following steps in 2023:\n1. Implemented an analysis of fluctuations and variances on a quarterly basis for the Income Statement which would detect material movements in account balances\nfrom both a dollar amount and percentage change perspective and research any differences over a defined threshold.\n2. Implemented an additional layer of review over the SEC reporting process and ensure that the overall financial statements and preparation are subject to\nconcurring review by a member of the SEC reporting team other than the SEC reporting manager.\nBased on the corrective actions described above, and testing completed for the year ended December 31, 2023, management has concluded that material weakness\nnoted above that existed as of December 31, 2022 has been remediated.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, that materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, none of the Company’s directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f))\nadopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of\nRule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.”\nITEM 9C.

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and\nthe related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph – Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the Company has\na significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions\nraise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting.\nAs part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2019\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 22, 2024\nPCAOB ID #688\nF-2\n180 LIFE SCIENCES CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Amounts in US Dollars, except share amounts)\nNOTE 1 - BUSINESS ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS\n180 Life Sciences Corp., formerly known as KBL Merger Corp. IV (“180LS”, or together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), was a blank check company\norganized under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 7, 2016. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition,\nshare purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.\n180 Life Corp. (“180”, f/k/a 180 Life Sciences Corp. and CannBioRx Life Sciences Corp.) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and was incorporated in the\nState of Delaware on January 28, 2019. The Company is located in the United States (“U.S.”) and is a medical pharmaceutical company focused upon unmet medical needs in\nthe areas of inflammatory diseases, fibrosis, and chronic pain by employing innovative research and, where appropriate, combination therapies, through 180’s three wholly-\nowned subsidiaries, 180 Therapeutics L.P. (“180 LP”), CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“CBR Pharma”), and Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Katexco”). 180 LP, CBR\nPharma and Katexco are together, the “180 Subsidiaries.” Katexco was incorporated on March 7, 2018 under the provisions of the British Corporation Act of British Columbia.\nAdditionally, 180’s wholly-owned subsidiaries Katexco Callco, ULC, Katexco Purchaseco, ULC, CannBioRex Callco, ULC, and CannBioRex Purchaseco, ULC were formed\nin the Canadian Province of British Columbia on May 31, 2019 to facilitate the acquisition of Katexco, CBR Pharma and 180 LP. On July 1, 2021, the assets and liabilities of\nthe Canadian companies (Katexco and CBR Pharma) were transferred to their respective subsidiaries, which are Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. (“Katexco U.S.”) and\nCannBioRex Pharma Limited (“CBR Pharma U.K.”).\nThe Company is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of therapeutics for unmet medical needs in chronic pain, inflammation, fibrosis,\nand other inflammatory diseases, where anti-TNF therapy will provide a clear benefit to patients, by employing innovative research, and, where appropriate, combination\ntherapy. We have three product development platforms:\n● fibrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”);\n● drugs which are derivatives of cannabidiol (“CBD”); and\n● alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (“α7nAChR”).\nDue to restrictions in the Company’s resources, the Company has not made progress in the α7nAChR platform and has suspended further research and development\nactivity in the meantime.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war and fluctuating interest rates on the economy\nand the capital markets and has concluded that, while it is reasonably possible that such events could have negative effects on the Company’s financial position, the specific\nimpacts are not readily determinable as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might\nresult from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nThe current challenging economic climate may lead to adverse changes in cash flows, working capital levels and/or debt balances, which may also have a direct\nimpact on the Company’s future operating results and financial position. The ultimate duration and magnitude of the impact and the efficacy of government interventions on the\neconomy and the financial effect on the Company is not known at this time. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and not\nin the Company’s control.\nReverse Stock-Split during 2024\nOn February 26, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a one-for-19 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding common stock and the filing of a\nCertificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to affect such reverse stock split, which was filed on February 26, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split became effective\non February 28, 2024 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time, with shares beginning trading on a split-adjusted basis at market open on February 28, 2024. In connection with the Reverse\nStock Split, every 19 shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time were automatically converted into one share of the Company’s\ncommon stock.\nIn connection with the reverse split, all outstanding options, warrants, and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of common\nstock were adjusted, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under the Company’s equity incentive plans were also\nappropriately adjusted. Following the reverse split, the par value of the Common Stock remained unchanged at $0.0001 par value per share. The reverse split did not change the\nauthorized number of shares of common stock or preferred stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse split, and stockholders who would otherwise\nbe entitled to receive a fractional share instead received one whole share of common stock in lieu of such fractional share.\nThe effects of the 1-for-19 Reverse Stock Split have been retroactively reflected throughout this Report; see Note 13 – Subsequent Events for additional details.\nF-9\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENT’S PLANS\nThe Company has not generated any revenues and has incurred significant losses since inception. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit\nof $127,343,657 and working capital deficit of $1,422,710 and for the year ended December 31, 2023, a net loss of $19,935,112 and cash used in operating activities of\n$10,922,223. The Company expects to invest a significant amount of capital to fund research and development. As a result, the Company expects that its operating expenses\nwill increase significantly, and consequently will require significant revenues to become profitable. Even if the Company does become profitable, it may not be able to sustain\nor increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company cannot predict when, if ever, it will be profitable. There can be no assurance that the intellectual property\nof the Company, or other technologies it may acquire, will meet applicable regulatory standards, obtain required regulatory approvals, be capable of being produced in\ncommercial quantities at reasonable costs, or be successfully marketed. The Company plans to undertake additional laboratory studies with respect to the intellectual property,\nand there can be no assurance that the results from such studies or trials will result in a commercially viable product or will not identify unwanted side effects.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the assumption of a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets\nand discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company’s ability to continue its operations is dependent upon obtaining new financing for its ongoing\noperations. Future financing options available to the Company include equity financings and loans and if the Company is unable to obtain such additional financing timely, or\non favorable terms, the Company may have to curtail its development, marketing and promotional activities, which would have a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, and it could ultimately be forced to discontinue its operations and liquidate. These matters raise substantial doubt about the\nCompany’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, which is defined as within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements\nare issued. Realization of the Company’s assets may be substantially different from the carrying amounts presented in these consolidated financial statements and the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may become necessary, should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America\n(“U.S. GAAP”).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries 180 LP, CBR Pharma, Katexco and 180 Life Corp.\n(“180LC”). All inter-company balances and transactions among the companies have been eliminated upon consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are presented in\nU.S. Dollars.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, together with amounts disclosed in the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s significant\nestimates and assumptions used in these financial statements include, but are not limited to, the fair value of financial instruments, warrants, options and derivative liabilities;\nR&D tax credits and accruals, and the estimates and assumptions related to the impairment analysis of IP R&D assets. Certain of the Company’s estimates could be affected by\nexternal conditions, including those unique to the Company and general economic conditions. It is reasonably possible that these external factors could have an effect on the\nCompany’s estimates and may cause actual results to differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company’s reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional currency of certain subsidiaries is the Canadian Dollar (“CAD”) or British Pound\n(“GBP”). Assets and liabilities are translated based on the exchange rates at the balance sheet date (0.7547 and 0.7369 for the CAD, 1.2730 and 1.2098 for the GBP as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively), while expense accounts are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period (0.7458 and 0.7689 for the CAD, and\n1.2667 and 1.2173 for the GBP for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively). Equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting\ntranslation adjustments are recognized in stockholders’ (deficit) equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of an entity from all sources other than investments by owners or distributions to owners and includes\nforeign currency translation adjustments as described above. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded other comprehensive loss of $15,816\nand $3,702,963, respectively, as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments.\nForeign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, including intercompany transactions, are included in results of\noperations. The Company recognized $2,380 and $12,777 in foreign currency transaction losses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Such amounts\nhave been classified within general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nF-10\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents in the financial statements. The Company\nhad no cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 or 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had bank accounts in the United States and the United Kingdom; of its\navailable cash balance, $25,474 is restricted cash. The Company’s cash deposits in United States and English financial institutions may at times be in excess of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) insurance limits, respectively. The Company has not experienced losses in\nsuch accounts and periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of its financial institutions.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination. The Company reviews\ngoodwill yearly, or more frequently whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered, for\nimpairment by initially considering qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nincluding goodwill, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative analysis is performed to identify goodwill impairment. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the\nfair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it is unnecessary to perform a quantitative analysis. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment\nand proceed directly to performing a quantitative analysis. See “Note 5 – Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets” for further information.\nIntangible Assets and In-Process Research and Development (“IP R&D”)\nIntangible assets consist of licensed patents held by Katexco as well as technology licenses acquired in connection with the Reorganization. Licensed patents are\namortized over the remaining life of the patent. Technology licenses represent the fair value of licenses acquired for the development and commercialization of certain licenses\nand knowledge. The technology licenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the underlying patents. It will be necessary to monitor and\npossibly adjust the useful lives of the licensed patents and technology licenses depending on the results of the Company’s research and development activities.\nIP R&D assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that were acquired on July 16, 2019 in connection with the Reorganization, which have not reached\ntechnological feasibility and have no alternative future use. IP R&D assets are considered to have indefinite-lives until the completion or abandonment of the associated\nresearch and development projects. During the period that the IP R&D assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more\nfrequently if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IP R&D assets are less than their carrying\namounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon regulatory approval, and the Company is able to commercialize products associated with the IP\nR&D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned,\nthe Company may record a full or partial impairment charge related to the IP R&D assets, calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the IP R&D assets over their\nestimated fair value. During 2023, the Company recorded a loss on impairment to IP R&D assets in the amount of $9,063,000, and as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nbalance of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet was $0 and $9,063,000, respectively. See “Note 5 – Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets” for further\ninformation.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company measures the fair value of financial assets and liabilities based on the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820 “Fair Value\nMeasurements” (“ASC 820”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nF-11\nASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires\nan entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may\nbe used to measure fair value:\n● Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n● Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable; and\n● Level 3 - Inputs that are unobservable (for example, cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions).\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting primarily of loans payable, approximate their fair values as presented in these\nconsolidated financial statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s derivative liabilities were valued using level 3 inputs (see Note 7 –\nDerivative Liabilities for additional information).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. The fair value of the award\nis measured on the grant date and is estimated by management based on observations of the recent cash sales prices of common stock. The fair value amount is then recognized\nover the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Upon the exercise of an option or warrant, the\nCompany issues new shares of common stock out of its authorized but unissued shares.\nDerivative Liabilities and Convertible Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its debt and equity issuances to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives requiring\nseparate recognition in the Company’s financial statements. Entities must consider whether to classify contracts that may be settled in its own stock, such as warrants, as equity\nof the entity or as an asset or liability. If an event that is not within the entity’s control could require net cash settlement, then the contract should be classified as an asset or a\nliability rather than as equity.\nThe result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market at each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability and\nthe change in fair value is recorded in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. In circumstances where there are multiple embedded\ninstruments that are required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single, compound derivative instrument. The classification of\nderivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. Equity instruments\nthat are initially classified as equity that become subject to reclassification are reclassified to liability at the fair value of the instrument on the reclassification date. Derivative\ninstrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument is expected within\ntwelve months of the balance sheet date.\nF-12\nIf the embedded conversion options do not require bifurcation, the Company then evaluates for the existence of a beneficial conversion feature by comparing the fair\nvalue of the Company’s underlying stock as of the commitment date to the effective conversion price of the instrument (the intrinsic value).\nDebt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption and are classified in interest expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Preferred stock discounts are only accreted to their redemption value if redemption becomes probable.\nAmendments to convertible instruments are evaluated as to whether they should be accounted for as a modification of the original instrument with no change to the\naccounting or, if the terms are substantially changed, as an extinguishment of the original instrument and the issuance of a new instrument.\nThe Company has computed the fair value of warrants and options issued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected term used for warrants,\nconvertible notes and convertible preferred stock are the contractual life and the expected term used for options issued is the estimated period of time that options granted are\nexpected to be outstanding. The Company utilizes the “simplified” method to develop an estimate of the expected term of “plain vanilla” option grants. The Company is\nutilizing an expected volatility figure based on a review of the historical volatilities, over a period of time, equivalent to the expected life of the instrument being valued, of\nsimilarly positioned public companies within its industry. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a\nremaining term consistent with the expected term of the instrument being valued.\nNet Loss Per Common Share\nBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss\nper common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the number of additional common shares that would\nhave been outstanding if the common share equivalents had been issued (computed using the treasury stock or if converted method), if dilutive.\nThe following common share equivalents are excluded from the calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding, because their inclusion would have been\nanti-dilutive:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nOptions 17,788 8,561\nWarrants 983,473(1) 180,832\nTotal potentially dilutive shares 1,001,261 189,393\n(1) Note that amount excludes 257,205 warrants that require holders to pay a nominal amount of consideration; such underlying shares are included in the weighted average\noutstanding shares calculation for the purposes of basic earnings per share as of December 31, 2023. As such, this number of warrants will differ from those disclosed in\nNote 7 by the same amount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $2,303,751\nand $2,191,834, respectively, of research and development expenses. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, research and development expenses – related parties were $480,777\nand $240,731, respectively. See Note 12 – Related Parties for more information on research and development expenses – related parties.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”).\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included or excluded in the financial\nstatements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective\nfinancial reporting amounts (“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\nThe Company utilizes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be\ntaken in a tax return. The Company’s policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax related interest as interest expense and penalties as general and administrative expenses in\nthe consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nF-13\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The\nstandard’s main goal is to improve financial reporting by requiring earlier recognition of credit losses on financing receivables and other financial assets in scope. The new\nguidance represents significant changes to accounting for credit losses, including i) full lifetime expected credit losses will be recognized upon initial recognition of an asset in\nscope; ii) the current incurred loss impairment model that recognizes losses when a probable threshold is met will be replaced with the expected credit loss impairment method\nwithout recognition threshold; and iii) the expected credit losses estimate will be based upon historical information, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. ASU 2016-13 is effective for SEC filers (excluding those that are eligible to be a smaller reporting company) for periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and for\nall other entities, for periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has adopted this standard effective January 1, 2023, and its adoption did not have a material\nimpact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOn November 27, 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The amendments were designed to\nimprove reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim\ndisclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for\nentities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The purpose of the amendments is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s\noverall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The ASU applies to all public entities that are required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280.\nAs the Company is not required to report segment information, this pronouncement does not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and\nrelated disclosures.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU focuses on income tax\ndisclosures around effective tax rates and cash income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 largely follows the proposed ASU issued earlier in 2023 with several important modifications\nand clarifications discussed below. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (generally, calendar year 2025)\nand effective for all other business entities one year later. Entities should adopt this guidance on a prospective basis, though retrospective application is permitted. The\nCompany is currently assessing the implications of this ASU.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 4 - PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nInsurance $ 934,990 $ 1,027,292\nResearch and development expense tax credit receivable 440,161 546,563\nProfessional fees 279,039 310,017\nValue-added tax receivable 9,917 48,774\nTaxes - 25,634\n$ 1,664,107 $ 1,958,280\nF-14\nNOTE 5 - INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nIntangible assets consist of the following as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nAmortization\nPeriod As of December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2022\nin Years at Gross Net Gross Net\nDecember 31, Asset Accumulated Carrying Asset Accumulated Carrying\n2023 Value Amortization Value Value Amortization Value\nLicensed patents 11.4 $ 599,686 $ (174,552) $ 425,134 $ 596,259 $ (142,654) $ 453,605\nTechnology license 15.6 1,562,744 (368,308) 1,194,436 1,485,159 (279,906) 1,205,253\n$ 2,162,430 $ (542,860) $ 1,619,570 $ 2,081,418 $ (422,560) $ 1,658,858\nChanges in the gross asset value of licensed patents and technology licenses from the dates acquired are the result of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate.\nThe Company recorded amortization expense of $105,675 and $109,004 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to intangible assets,\nwhich is included in general and administrative expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nFuture amortization related to intangible assets is as follows:\nFor the Years Ending December 31,\n2024 $ 113,793\n2025 113,793\n2026 113,793\n2027 113,793\n2028 113,793\nThereafter 1,050,606\n$ 1,619,571\nGoodwill Impairment\nThe Company’s publicly traded stock closed at $1,482.00 per share as of December 31, 2021; during 2022, the market value of the Company’s single reporting unit\nsignificantly declined. As of March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the market value of the Company’s publicly traded stock fell to\n$984.20, $322.24, $252.70 and $64.41, per share, respectively, and as such, the Company elected to conduct a quantitative analysis of goodwill to assess for impairment as of\nSeptember 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022. The Company determined the fair market value of its single reporting unit and compared that value with the carrying amount of\nthe reporting unit and determined that goodwill was impaired as of both measurement dates. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value exceeded the\nfair market value by $18,872,850 and $14,674,428, respectively. To recognize the impairment of goodwill, the Company recorded losses for these amounts at the end of the\nthird and fourth quarters, which appear as a loss on goodwill impairment of $33,547,278 on the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance for goodwill is $0 for both periods.\nF-15\nThe following is a summary of goodwill activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 for the Company’s single reporting unit, which includes the recorded losses on\ngoodwill impairment described above.\nCBR\nPharma 180 LP Consolidated\nGoodwill Goodwill Goodwill\nBalance, January 1, 2022 $ 23,749,631 $ 13,238,255 $ 36,987,886\nCurrency translation (3,440,608) - (3,440,608)\nImpairment of goodwill (20,309,023) (13,328,255) (33,547,278)\nBalance, December 31, 2022 $ - $ - $ -\nIP R&D Assets Impairment\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet was $12,405,084 (which consists of carrying amounts of $1,462,084 and\n$10,943,000 related to the Company’s CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). Per the valuation obtained from a third party as of year-end, the fair\nmarket value of the Company’s IP R&D assets was determined to be $9,063,000 (which consists of fair values of $0 and $9,063,000 related to the Company’s CBR Pharma\nsubsidiary and 180 LP subsidiary, respectively). As of this measurement date, the carrying values of the CBR Pharma and 180 LP subsidiaries’ assets exceeded their fair market\nvalues by $1,462,084 and $1,880,000, respectively. As such, management determined that the consolidated IP R&D assets were impaired by $3,342,084 and, in order to\nrecognize the impairment, the Company recorded a loss for this amount during the fourth quarter of 2022, which appears as a loss on impairment to IP R&D assets on the\nincome statement. This reduced the IP R&D asset balances of its CBR Pharma subsidiary and its 180 LP subsidiary to zero and $9,063,000, respectively, as of December 31,\n2022.\nF-16\nDuring 2023, the Company assessed the most recent delays in its commercialization timeline, general economic conditions, industry and market considerations, the\nCompany’s financial performance and all relevant legal, regulatory, and political factors that might indicate the possibility of impairment and concluded that, when these factors\nwere collectively evaluated, it was more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The Company recorded a loss in the amount of $9,063,000, which appeared as a loss on\nimpairment to IP R&D assets on the income statement. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet is $0.\nBecause of the write-off of the IP R&D assets on the balance sheet and the loss on impairment to IP R&D assets on the income statement, the Company recorded a\ndecrease in its deferred tax liability relating to the impairment of the IP R&D assets of $2.3 million as income tax benefit relating to impairment of the IP R&D assets in the\nsame amount on the income statement for the period ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following is a summary of IP R&D activity for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 for the Company, which includes the recorded losses for the IP R&D\nassets described above.\nCBR 180 LP IP Consolidated\nPharma IP R&D IP R&D\nR&D Assets Assets Assets\nBalance, January 1, 2022 $ 1,632,780 $ 10,943,000 $ 12,575,780\nCurrency translation (170,696) - (170,696)\nImpairment of IP R&D assets (1,462,084) (1,880,000) (3,342,084)\nBalance, December 31, 2022 - 9,063,000 9,063,000\nImpairment of IP R&D assets - (9,063,000) (9,063,000)\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ - $ - $ -\nNOTE 6 - ACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccrued expenses consist of the following as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nConsulting fees $ 645,081 $ 531,829\nProfessional fees 184,846 3,945\nLitigation accrual (1) 49,999 125,255\nEmployee and director compensation (2) 530,383 1,558,024\nResearch and development fees 378,683 22,023\nInterest 70,923 36,422\nOther 9,899 7,018\n$ 1,869,814 $ 2,284,516\n(1) See Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies, Potential Legal Matters.\n(2) See Note 13 – Subsequent Events for additional details for this current year balance.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accrued expenses - related parties were $0 and $188,159, respectively.

Each Public SPAC Warrant entitles\nthe holder to purchase one-seven hundred sixtieth of one share of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per 1/760th of one share, or $4,370.00 per whole\nshare, subject to adjustment. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants are currently exercisable and will expire on\nNovember 6, 2025, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant\nupon 30 days’ notice (“30-day redemption period”), only in the event that the last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $6,840.00 per share for any 20 trading days\nwithin a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given, provided there is an effective registration statement with\nrespect to the shares of common stock underlying such Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the 30-day\nredemption period. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption as described above, the Company’s management will have the option to require all holders that\nwish to exercise Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” Management has determined that the Public Warrants contain a tender offer provision which could result in the\nPublic Warrants settling for the tender offer consideration (including potentially cash) in a transaction that didn’t result in a change-in-control. This feature results in the Public\nWarrants being precluded from equity classification. Accordingly, the Public Warrants are classified as liabilities measured at fair value, with changes in fair value each period\nreported in earnings. The fair value of the Public SPAC Warrants on the date of the issuance was $1,978,000. At December 31, 2023 and 2022 the Public SPAC Warrants were\nrevalued at $58 and $31,625, respectively, which resulted in decreases of $31,567 and $8,017,225 in the fair value of the derivative liabilities during the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decreases in fair value of these derivative liabilities were recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nF-19\nPrivate SPAC Warrants\nParticipants in KBL’s initial private placement received an aggregate of 502,500 Private SPAC Warrants (“Private SPAC Warrants”). Each Private Warrant entitles the\nholder to purchase one-seven hundred sixtieth of one share of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per 1/760th of one share, or $4,370.00 per whole\nshare, subject to adjustment. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. The Private Warrants are currently exercisable and will expire five years after the\ncompletion of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Private Warrants are non-redeemable so long as they are held by original holders or\ntheir permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by other parties, the Company may redeem the Private Warrants, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per\nWarrant upon 30 days’ notice (“30-day redemption period”), only in the event that the last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $6,840.00 per share for any 20\ntrading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which notice of redemption is given, provided there is an effective registration\nstatement with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such Warrants and a current prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available throughout the\n30-day redemption period. If the Company calls the Private Warrants for redemption as described above, the Company’s management will have the option to require all holders\nthat wish to exercise Private Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” Management has determined that the Private Warrants contain a tender offer provision which could result\nin the Private Warrants settling for the tender offer consideration (including potentially cash) in a transaction that didn’t result in a change-in-control. This feature (amongst\nothers) results in the Private Warrants being precluded from equity classification. Accordingly, the Private Warrants are classified as liabilities measured at fair value, with\nchanges in fair value each period reported in earnings. The fair value of the Private SPAC Warrants on the date of the issuance was $587,925. At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe Private SPAC Warrants were revalued at $0 and $1,256, respectively, which resulted in decreases of $1,256 and $466,069 in the fair value of the derivative liabilities during\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decreases in fair value of these derivative liabilities were recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement\nof operations.\nPIPE Warrants\nOn February 23, 2021, the Company issued five-year warrants (the “PIPE Warrants”) to purchase 6,748 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1,900.00 per\nshare in connection with the private offering (see Note 10 – Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity, Common Stock). The PIPE Warrants did not meet the requirements for equity\nclassification due to the existence of a tender offer provision that could potentially result in cash settlement of the PIPE Warrants that didn’t meet the limited exception in the\ncase of a change-in-control. Accordingly, the PIPE Warrants are liability-classified and the Company recorded the $7,294,836 fair value of the PIPE Warrants, which was\ndetermined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as derivative liabilities. The PIPE Warrants were revalued on December 31, 2023 and 2022 at $0 and $42,100,\nrespectively, which resulted in decreases in the fair value of the derivative liabilities of $42,100 and $6,474,200 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe following assumptions were used to value the PIPE Warrants at issuance:\nFebruary 23,\n2021\nRisk-free interest rate 0.59%\nExpected term in years 5.00\nExpected volatility 85%\nExpected dividends 0%\nOther Warrants\nAGP Warrant\nIn connection with the closing of the Business Combination on November 6, 2020, the Company became obligated to assume five-year warrants for the purchase of\n168 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $2,006.40 per share (the “AGP Warrant Liability”) that had originally been issued by KBL to an investment\nbanking firm in connection with a prior private placement.\nF-20\nOn March 12, 2021, the Company issued a warrant to AGP (the “AGP Warrant”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 168 shares of the Company’s common stock at a\npurchase price of $2,006.40 per share, subject to adjustment, in full satisfaction of the existing AGP Warrant Liability. The exercise of the AGP Warrant is limited at any given\ntime to prevent AGP from exceeding beneficial ownership of 4.99% of the then total number of issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock upon such\nexercise. The warrant is exercisable at any time between May 2, 2021 and May 2, 2025. The newly issued AGP Warrant did not meet the requirements for equity classification\ndue to the existence of a tender offer provision that could potentially result in cash settlement of the AGP Warrant that did not meet the limited exception in the case of a\nchange-in-control. Accordingly, the AGP Warrant will continue to be liability-classified. The AGP Warrant was revalued on December 31, 2023 and 2022 at $0 and $400,\nrespectively, which resulted in decreases in the fair value of the derivative liabilities of $400 and $143,931 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following assumptions were used to value the AGP Warrant at issuance:\nMarch 12,\n2021\nRisk-free interest rate 0.68%\nExpected term in years 3.84\nExpected volatility 85%\nExpected dividends 0%\nAlpha Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”) Warrant\nIn connection with the Alpha Settlement Agreement that was agreed to on July 29, 2021 (signed on July 31, 2021), the Company issued a three-year warrant for the\npurchase of 66 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $2,686.60 per share (the “Alpha Warrant Liability” and the “Alpha Warrant”). The exercise of\nshares of the Alpha Warrant is limited at any given time to prevent Alpha from exceeding a beneficial ownership of 4.99% of the then total number of issued and outstanding\nshares of the Company’s common stock upon such exercise. The warrant is exercisable until August 2, 2024. The newly issued Alpha Warrant did not meet the requirements for\nequity classification due to the existence of a tender offer provision that could potentially result in cash settlement of the Alpha Warrant that did not meet the limited exception\nin the case of a change-in-control. Accordingly, the Alpha Warrant is liability-classified and the Company recorded the $95,677 fair value of the Alpha Warrant, which was\ndetermined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, as a derivative liability. The Alpha Warrant was revalued on December 31, 2023 and 2022 at $0 for both periods,\nwhich resulted in decreases in the fair value of the derivative liabilities of $0 and $43,561 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following assumptions were used to value the Alpha Warrant at issuance:\nJuly 29,\n2021\nRisk-free interest rate 0.37%\nExpected term in years 3.00\nExpected volatility 85%\nExpected dividends 0%\nF-21\nWarrant Activity\nA summary of the warrant activity (including certain warrants granted in August 2021, July 2022, December 2022, April 2023, August 2023 and November 2023 as\npart of private offerings, all of which are equity-classified; see Note 10 - Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity) during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is presented\nbelow:\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted Remaining Life\nNumber of Average in Intrinsic\nWarrants Exercise Price Years Value\nOutstanding, January 1, 2022 29,355 $ 3,442.24 4.1 $ -\nIssued 237,312 65.36 5.4\nExercised (85,837) 0.0019 -\nOutstanding, December 31, 2022 180,832 $ 644.80 5.1 125,211\nIssued 1,329,275 1.95 4.1 1,706,815\nExercised (269,429) 0.0019 - -\nOutstanding, December 31, 2023 1,240,678 $ 83.98 5.1 $ 1,832,026\nExercisable, December 31, 2023 29,355 $ 3,444.24 2.1 -\nA summary of outstanding and exercisable warrants as of December 31, 2023 is presented below:\nWarrants Outstanding Warrants Exercisable\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Number of Remaining Number of\nPrice Shares Life in Years Shares\n$ 1,900.00 6,748 2.2 6,748\n$ 2,006.40 168 1.3 168\n$ 2,686.60 66 0.6 66\n$ 2,850.00 6,579 2.6 6,579\n$ 4,370.00 15,793 1.9 15,794\n$ 3.23 954,119(1) - -\n$ 0.0019 257,205(2) - -\n1,240,678 2.1 29,355\n(1) Note that this number of shares is comprised of the July 2022, December 2022, April 2023, August 2023 and the Amendment to the August 2023 common warrants; as of\nDecember 31, 2023, none of these warrants were exercisable, as the meeting to obtain shareholder approval for these warrants did not occur until February 16, 2024.

The BBLS is unsecured and\nbears interest at 2.5% per annum. The maximum loan amount is GBP £50,000 and the length of the loan is six years, with payments beginning 12 months after the date of\ndisbursement. Early repayment is allowed, without early repayment fees. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded accrued interest of GBP £248 (USD $316)\nand GBP £477 (USD $732), respectively, related to the BBLS loan. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded interest expense of GBP £549\n(USD $683) and GBP £721 (USD $901), respectively, related to the BBLS loan.\nOn December 10, 2022, the Company entered into a financing arrangement for a Directors and Officers Insurance Policy (the “D&O Insurance”) with First Insurance\nFunding to finance $872,034 of a total D&O Insurance amount of $1,060,891 inclusive of premiums, taxes, and fees. During 2023, the Company paid in full the balance of the\n2022 D&O Insurance. On December 10, 2023, the Company entered into a financing arrangement for another policy with First Insurance Funding to finance $903,098 of a total\nD&O Insurance amount of $969,322 inclusive of premiums, taxes, and fees. As of December 31, 2023, a total of $872,390 remains financed in loans payable, due in monthly\ninstallments of $90,310.\nInterest Expense (Income) on Loans Payable\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized interest expense — related parties associated with outstanding loans payable of $18,436\nand $14,156, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized interest income — related parties associated with outstanding loans payable of $0 and\n($1,490), respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued interest and accrued interest — related parties associated with outstanding loans payable of $70,923 and $0,\nrespectively.

See Note 12 — Related Parties for additional details.\nF-25\nNOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation and Other Loss Contingencies\nThe Company records liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has no liabilities recorded for loss contingencies as of December 31, 2023.\nPotential Legal Matters\nAction Against Former Executive of KBL\nOn September 1, 2021, the Company initiated legal action in the Chancery Court of Delaware against Dr. Marlene Krauss, the Company’s former Chief Executive\nOfficer and director (“Dr. Krauss”) and two of her affiliated companies, KBL IV Sponsor, LLC and KBL Healthcare Management, Inc. (collectively, the “KBL Affiliates”) for,\namong other things, engaging in unauthorized monetary transfers of the Company’s assets, non-disclosure of financial liabilities within the Company’s Consolidated Financial\nStatements, issuing shares of stock without proper authorization; and improperly allowing stockholder redemptions to take place. The Company’s complaint alleges causes of\naction against Dr. Krauss and/or the KBL Affiliates for breach of fiduciary duties, ultra vires acts, unjust enrichment, negligence and declaratory relief, and seeks compensatory\ndamages in excess of $11,286,570, together with interest, attorneys’ fees and costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its legal actions.\nOn October 5, 2021, Dr. Krauss and the KBL Affiliates filed an Answer, Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint (the “Krauss Counterclaims”) against the Company\nand twelve individuals who are, or were, directors and/or officers of the Company, i.e., Marc Feldmann, Lawrence Steinman, James N. Woody, Teresa DeLuca, Frank Knuettel\nII, Pamela Marrone, Lawrence Gold, Donald A. McGovern, Jr., Russell T. Ray, Richard W. Barker, Shoshana Shendelman and Ozan Pamir (collectively, the “Third-Party\nDefendants”). On October 27, 2021, the Company and Ozan Pamir filed an Answer to the Krauss Counterclaims, and all of the other Third-Party Defendants filed a Motion to\nDismiss as to the Third-Party Complaint.\nOn January 28, 2022, in lieu of filing an opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, Dr. Krauss and the KBL Affiliates filed a Motion for leave to file amended counterclaims\nand third-party complaint, and to dismiss six of the current and former directors previously named, i.e., to dismiss Teresa DeLuca, Frank Knuettel II, Pamela Marrone, Russell\nT. Ray, Richard W. Barker and Shoshana Shendelman. The Motion was granted by stipulation and, on February 24, 2022, Dr. Krauss filed an amended Answer, Counterclaims\nand Third-Party Complaint (the “Amended Counterclaims”). In essence, the Amended Counterclaims allege (a) that the Company and the remaining Third-Party Defendants\nbreached fiduciary duties to Dr. Krauss by making alleged misstatements against Dr. Krauss in SEC filings and failing to register her shares in the Company so that they could\nbe traded, and (b) the Company breached contracts between the Company and Dr. Krauss for registration of such shares, and also failed to pay to Dr. Krauss the amounts\nalleged to be owing under a promissory note in the principal amount of $371,178, plus an additional $300,000 under Dr. Krauss’s resignation agreement. The Amended\nCounterclaims seek unspecified amounts of monetary damages, declaratory relief, equitable and injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and costs.\nOn March 16, 2022, Donald A. McGovern, Jr. and Lawrence Gold filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Counterclaims against them, and the Company and the\nremaining Third-Party Defendants filed an Answer to the Amended Counterclaims denying the same. On April 19, 2022, Dr. Krauss stipulated to dismiss all of her\ncounterclaims and allegations against both Donald A. McGovern, Jr. and Lawrence Gold, thereby mooting their Motion to Dismiss the Amended Counterclaims against them.\nThe Company and the Third-Party Defendants intend to continue to vigorously defend against all of the Amended Counterclaims, however, there can be no assurance that they\nwill be successful in the legal defense of such Amended Counterclaims. In April 2022, Donald A. McGovern, Jr. and Lawrence Gold were dismissed from the lawsuit as parties.\nDiscovery has not yet commenced in the case. The Company and the Third-Party Defendants intend to continue to vigorously defend against all the Amended Counterclaims,\nhowever, there can be no assurance that they will be successful in the legal defense of such Amended Counterclaims.\nF-26\nAction Against the Company by Dr. Krauss\nOn August 19, 2021, Dr. Krauss initiated legal action in the Chancery Court of Delaware against the Company. The original Complaint sought expedited relief and\nmade the following two claims: (1) it alleged that the Company is obligated to advance expenses including, attorney’s fees, to Dr. Krauss for the costs of defending against the\nSEC and certain Subpoenas served by the SEC on Dr. Krauss; and (2) it alleged that the Company is also required to reimburse Dr. Krauss for the costs of bringing this lawsuit\nagainst the Company. On or about September 3, 2021, Dr. Krauss filed an Amended and Supplemental Complaint (the “Amended Complaint”) in this action, which added the\nfurther claims that Dr. Krauss is also allegedly entitled to advancement by the Company of her expenses, including attorney’s fees, for the costs of defending against the Third-\nParty Complaint in the Tyche Capital LLC action referenced below, and the costs of defending against the Company’s own Complaint against Dr. Krauss as described\nabove. On or about September 23, 2021, the Company filed its Answer to the Amended Complaint in which the Company denied each of Dr. Krauss’ claims and further raised\nnumerous affirmative defenses with respect thereto.\nOn November 15, 2021, Dr. Krauss filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication as to certain of the issues in the case, which was opposed by the Company. A hearing on\nsuch Motion was held on December 7, 2021, and, on March 7, 2022, the Court issued a decision in the matter denying the Motion for Summary Adjudication in part and\ngranting it in part. The Court then issued an Order implementing such a decision on March 29, 2022. The parties are now engaging in proceedings set forth in that\nimplementing Order. The Court granted Dr. Krauss’s request for advancement of some of the legal fees which Dr. Krauss requested in her Motion, and the Company was\nrequired to pay a portion of those fees while it objects to the remaining portion of disputed fees.\nOn October 10, 2022, Dr. Krauss filed an application to compel the Company to pay the full amount of fees requested by Dr. Krauss for May-July 2022, and to modify\nthe Court’s Order. The Company filed its Opposition thereto. On January 18, 2023, Dr. Krauss filed a Second Application to compel the Company to pay the full amount of fees\nrequested by Dr. Krauss for August-October 2022, and to modify the Court’s Order. The Company filed its Opposition thereto. On May 3, 2023, the Court issued an Order\ngranting both of Dr. Krauss’s Applications for payment of the full amount of requested attorney’s fees totaling $714,557 for the months of May through October 2022, which\nwere paid in May 2023. Notwithstanding the Order, such ruling does not constitute any final adjudication as to whether Dr. Krauss will ultimately be entitled to permanently\nretain such advancements, and Dr. Krauss has posted an undertaking with the Court affirmatively promising to repay all such amounts if she is eventually found to be liable for\nthe Company’s and/or the SEC’s claims against her. The Company is seeking payment for a substantial portion of such amounts from its director and officers’ insurance policy,\nof which no assurance can be provided that the directors and officers insurance policy will cover such amounts.\nAction Against Tyche Capital LLC\nThe Company commenced and filed an action against defendant Tyche Capital LLC (“Tyche”) in the Supreme Court of New York, in the County of New York, on\nApril 15, 2021. In its Complaint, the Company alleged claims against Tyche arising out of Tyche’s breach of its written contractual obligations to the Company as set forth in a\n“Guarantee and Commitment Agreement” dated July 25, 2019, and a “Term Sheet for KBL Business Combination With CannBioRex” dated April 10, 2019 (collectively, the\n“Subject Guarantee”). The Company alleges in its Complaint that, notwithstanding demand having been made on Tyche to perform its obligations under the Subject Guarantee,\nTyche has failed and refused to do so, and is currently in debt to the Company for such failure in the amount of $6,776,686, together with interest accruing thereon at the rate\nset forth in the Subject Guarantee.\nOn or about May 17, 2021, Tyche responded to the Company’s Complaint by filing an Answer and Counterclaims against the Company alleging that it was the\nCompany, rather than Tyche, that had breached the Subject Guarantee. Tyche also filed a Third-Party Complaint against six third-party defendants, including three members of\nthe Company’s management, Sir Marc Feldmann, Dr. James Woody, and Ozan Pamir (collectively, the “Individual Company Defendants”), claiming that they allegedly\nbreached fiduciary duties to Tyche with regards to the Subject Guarantee. In that regard, on June 25, 2021, each of the Individual Company Defendants filed a Motion to\nDismiss Tyche’s Third-Party Complaint against them.\nOn November 23, 2021, the Court granted the Company’s request to issue an Order of attachment against all of Tyche’s shares of the Company’s stock that had been\nheld in escrow. In so doing, the Court found that the Company had demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of the case based on the facts alleged in the Company’s\nComplaint.\nF-27\nOn February 18, 2022, Tyche filed an Amended Answer, Counterclaims and Third-Party Complaint. On March 22, 2022, the Company and each of the Individual\nCompany Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss all of Tyche’s claims. A hearing on such Motion to Dismiss was held on August 25, 2022, and the Court granted the Motion to\nDismiss entirely as to each of the Individual Company Defendants, and also as to three of the four Counterclaims brought against the Company, only leaving Tyche’s\ndeclaratory relief claim. On September 9, 2022, Tyche filed a Notice of Appeal as to the Court’s decision, which has not yet been briefed or adjudicated. On August 26, 2022,\nTyche filed a Motion to vacate or modify the Company’s existing attachment Order against Tyche’s shares of the Company’s stock held in escrow. The Company has filed its\nOpposition thereto, and the Court summarily denied such Motion without hearing on January 3, 2023. Tyche subsequently filed a Notice of Appeal as to that denial and filed its\nOpening Brief on January 30, 2023. The Company filed its opposition brief on March 2, 2023, and the matter was taken under submission by the Appellate Court. On May 4,\n2023, the Appellate Court issued its decision unanimously affirming the ruling of the lower Court in the Company’s favor.\nOn January 30, 2023, the Company filed a Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment and to Dismiss Affirmative Defenses against Tyche. Tyche filed opposition\nthereto, and hearings on the Company’s Motion were ultimately held on September 11 and 19, 2023. In its ruling, the Court granted the Company’s Motion, but referred the\nquestion as to the amount of the Company’s damages against Tyche to a special referee. The Court and the parties are now in the process of appointing the special referee so\nthat a determination can be made as to the amount of the Company’s damages against Tyche. Tyche filed a Notice of Appeal as the Court’s summary judgment ruling on\nOctober 12, 2023. No briefing for the appeal has yet occurred. The Company intends to continue to vigorously pursue its claims against Tyche, and the Company and the\nIndividual Company Defendants intend to continue to vigorously defend against all of Tyche’s claims should they be appealed; however, there can be no assurance that they\nwill be successful in such endeavors.\nAction Against Ronald Bauer & Samantha Bauer\nThe Company and two of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Katexco Pharmaceuticals Corp. and CannBioRex Pharmaceuticals Corp. (collectively, the “Company\nPlaintiffs”), initiated legal action against Ronald Bauer and Samantha Bauer, as well as two of their companies, Theseus Capital Ltd. and Astatine Capital Ltd. (collectively, the\n“Bauer Defendants”), in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on February 25, 2022. The Company Plaintiffs are seeking damages against the Bauer Defendants for\nmisappropriated funds and stock shares, unauthorized stock sales, and improper travel expenses, in the combined sum of at least $4,395,000 CAD [$3,317,408 USD] plus the\nadditional sum of $2,721,036 USD (which relate to the aforementioned damages).\nThe Bauer Defendants filed a Response to the Civil Claim Complaint of the Company on May 6, 2022, in which the Bauer Defendants denied the Company’s claims\nand set forth their own version of the facts in the matter. Discovery has not yet commenced in the case. There can be no assurance that the Company Plaintiffs will be successful\nin this legal action.\nDeclaratory Relief Action Against the Company by AmTrust International\nOn June 29, 2022, AmTrust International Underwriters DAC (“AmTrust”), which was the premerger directors’ and officers’ insurance policy underwriter for KBL,\nfiled a declaratory relief action against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Declaratory Relief Action”) seeking declaration of\nAmTrust’s obligations under the directors’ and officers’ insurance policy. In the Declaratory Relief Action, AmTrust is claiming that as a result of the merger the Company is\nno longer the insured under the subject insurance policy, notwithstanding the fact that the fees which the Company seeks to recover from AmTrust relate to matters occurring\nprior to the merger.\nOn September 20, 2022, the Company filed its Answer and Counterclaims against AmTrust for bad faith breach of AmTrust’s insurance coverage obligations to the\nCompany under the subject directors’ and officers’ insurance policy, and seeking damages of at least $2 million in compensatory damages, together with applicable punitive\ndamages. In addition, the Company brought a Third-Party Complaint against its excess insurance carrier, Freedom Specialty Insurance Company (“Freedom”) seeking\ndeclaratory relief that Freedom will also be required to honor its policy coverage as soon as the amount of AmTrust’s insurance coverage obligations to the Company have been\nexhausted. On October 25, 2022, AmTrust filed its Answer to the Company’s Counterclaims and, on October 27, 2022, Freedom filed its Answer to the Third-Party Complaint.\nF-28\nOn November 22, 2022, the Company filed a Motion for Summary Adjudication against both AmTrust and Freedom. The Motion was fully briefed and a hearing was\nheld on March 9, 2023. The standard to prevail on a Motion for Summary Adjudication in the Court is high to prevail and requires a judge to find that there are no disputed\nissues of fact so that they can rule on the issues as a matter of law. In this instance the judge found three major issues could be decided as a matter of law in the Company’s\nfavor and that one issue, the Change in Control exclusion, requires further discovery.\nOn April 21, 2023, the Court issued an Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\nSpecifically, the Court granted summary adjudication in favor of the Company on the following issues: (a) that the Company is, in fact, an insured under both the\nAmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; (b) that certain SEC subpoena related expenses for defendants Dr. Marlene Krauss, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer\nand Director, and George Hornig, the former Chairman of the Board, are within the basic scope of coverage under both the AmTrust and Freedom insurance policies; and (c)\nthat the Insured vs. Insured exclusion relied upon by AmTrust and Freedom is not applicable to bar any such coverage.\nThe Court also found that there were issues of disputed facts as to the Change in Control exclusion contained within the policies, which therefore precluded the Court\nfrom granting the remainder of the Company’s requests for summary adjudication as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court, at this time, denied the Company’s further requests\nfor summary adjudication and deemed that for the time being, the Change in Control issue is to be determined at the time of trial, in order to find that the policies (i) provide\ncoverage for the fees which the Company has advanced and will advance to Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig; (ii) that AmTrust has breached the policy; (iii) that\nAmTrust must pay such expenses of the Company; and that, once the AmTrust policy has been exhausted, (iv) Freedom will be obligated to pay such expenses of the Company\npursuant to its policy.\nOn August 4, 2023, the Court granted the Company’s request to file a second motion for partial summary judgment in this case, this one being on the issue of whether\nAmTrust should be required to advance to the Company the defense costs being incurred by Dr. Marlene Krauss and George Hornig during the pendency of the case. The\nMotion for Partial Summary Judgment was fully briefed by the parties, and a hearing for such Motion was held on January 11, 2024. After the matter was taken under\nsubmission, on February 12, 2024, the Court granted the Company’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against both AmTrust and Freedom, and ordered as follows: (a)\nAmTrust is obligated under its insurance policy with the Company to advance to the Company all defense costs in excess of the deductible that the Company has advanced, or\nwill advance, to Dr. Krauss and Mr. Hornig in connection with certain SEC Subpoenas, and (b) upon exhaustion of the AmTrust insurance policy, Freedom is obligated to do\nthe same pursuant to its excess liability insurance policy with the Company. This Order applies throughout the interim of the case, but does not constitute a final judgment, and\nboth the Company and the two insurers retain their rights to contest all applicable issues at trial, which is scheduled for May 12, 2025. A final judgment following trial could\npotentially confirm these obligations of the insurers or, alternatively, reverse and require the Company to repay all or portions of such advance payments. There is no assurance\nat this time as to what the final judgment may entail.\nThe parties have commenced written discovery proceedings against each other and anticipate that depositions will also occur. The Company intends to continue to\nvigorously pursue this matter in order to establish the Company’s entitlement to full and final payment by both AmTrust and Freedom of the subject advancement expenses of\nthe Company. While the Company continues to believe it has a strong case against both AmTrust and Freedom, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this\naction.\nStanford License Agreement\nOn May 8, 2018, Katexco entered into a six-month option agreement (the “Stanford Option”) with Stanford University (“Stanford”) under which Stanford granted the\nCompany a six-month option to acquire an exclusive license for patents (the “Licensed Patents”) which are related to biological substances used to treat auto- immune diseases.\nIn consideration for the Stanford Option, the Company paid Stanford $10,000 (the “Option Payment”), which was creditable against the first anniversary license maintenance\nfee payment.\nOn July 25, 2018, Katexco exercised their six-month option and entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Stanford License Agreement”) with Stanford.\nPursuant to the Stanford License Agreement, beginning upon the first anniversary of the effective date, and each anniversary thereafter, the Company will pay Stanford, in\nadvance, a yearly license maintenance fee of $20,000, on each of the first and second anniversaries and $40,000 on each subsequent anniversary, which will be expensed on a\nstraight-line basis annually.\nF-29\nFurthermore, the Company will be obligated to make the following milestone payments:\ni) $100,000 upon initiation of Phase II trial;\nii) $500,000 upon the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a product (the “Licensed Product”) resulting from the Licensed Patents; and\niii) $250,000 upon each new Licensed Product thereafter.\nThe Stanford License Agreement is cancellable by the Company with 30 days notice. Royalties, calculated at 2.5% of 95% of net product sales, will be payable to\nStanford. Also, the Company will reimburse Stanford for patent expenses as per the agreement. The Company paid Stanford $20,000 for the annual license maintenance fee that\nwas recorded to prepaid expenses and is being expensed on a straight-line basis over 12 months, which had a zero balance as of December 31, 2021. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded patent and license fees of $55,526 and $69,278, respectively, related to the Stanford License Agreement, which is\nincluded in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nOxford University Agreements\nOn September 18, 2020, CBR Pharma entered into a 3 year research and development agreement (the “3 Year Oxford Agreement”) with Oxford to research and\ninvestigate the mechanisms underlying fibrosis in exchange for aggregate consideration of $1,085,738 (£795,468), of which $109,192 (£80,000) is to be paid 30 days after the\nproject start date and the remaining amount is to be paid in four equal installments of $244,136 (£178,867) on the six month anniversary and each of the annual anniversaries of\nthe project start date.

The agreement can be terminated by either party upon\nwritten notice or if the Company remains in default on any payments due under this agreement for more than 30 days. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany recognized $0 (£0) and $123,891 (£101,778), respectively, of research and development expenses in connection with the 2 Year Oxford Agreement, which is reflected\nwithin accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company owed Oxford no monies for the 2-year agreement.\nOn May 24, 2021, the Company entered into a research agreement with the University of Oxford (“Oxford” and the “Fifth Oxford Agreement”), pursuant to which the\nCompany will sponsor work at the University of Oxford to conduct a multi-center, randomized, double blind, parallel group, feasibility study of anti-TNF injection for the\ntreatment of adults with frozen shoulder during the pain-predominant phase. As a consideration, the Company agreed to make the following payments to Oxford:\nAmount Due\nMilestone (excluding VAT)\nUpon signing of the Fifth Oxford Agreement £ 70,546\n6 months post signing of the Fifth Oxford Agreement £ 70,546\n12 months post signing of the Fifth Oxford Agreement £ 70,546\n24 months post signing of the Fifth Oxford Agreement £ 70,546\nF-30\nThe Company paid the first milestone of $97,900 (£70,546) on September 3, 2021, which was due upon signing of the Fifth Oxford Agreement, which was recorded to\nprepaid expenses and will be amortized over the term of the agreement on a straight-line basis. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded\n$74,465 (£58,788) and $271,931 (£223,394), respectively, of research and development expenses and has prepaid balances of $0 (£0) and $14,233 (£11,756), respectively,\nrelated to the Fifth Oxford Agreement.\nOn November 2, 2021, the Company and Oxford University entered into a twenty-year licensed technology agreement of the HMGB1 molecule, which is related to\ntissue regeneration, whereby Oxford University agreed to license the technology to the Company for research, development and use of the licensed patents. The Company\nagreed to pay Oxford University for past patent costs $66,223 (£49,207), an initial License fee of $13,458 (£10,000), future royalties based on sales and milestones, and an\nannual maintenance fee of $4,037 (£3,000). The Company has the option to terminate the agreement after the third anniversary of the agreement. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $721,362 and $10,581, respectively, of research and development expenses related to this agreement.\nDue to the ongoing costs of the HMGB1 research program and the need for the Company to focus its resources on the Company’s primary platform to treat fibrosis\nusing anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor), the Board of Directors of the Company elected to terminate the Company’s HMGB1 license agreement with Oxford on September 22,\n2023, and on September 22, 2023, the Company and Oxford entered into a termination letter, formally terminating the License effective September 22, 2023. The termination\nletter also clarified amounts that we owed after termination of the License, including approximately $20,000 in unbilled fees. No material early termination penalties were\nincurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the license.\nDue to recent financial constraints, the Company has been unable to timely pay amounts due to Oxford, the licensor of the majority of the Company’s licenses and\npatents and the Company’s research partner. Oxford alleges that an aggregate of approximately £929,030 is owed from the Company and one of its subsidiaries to Oxford under\nthe terms of licenses and agreements with Oxford and related parties. The Company is currently in ongoing discussions with Oxford to reduce that amount and enter into a\npayment plan with regards to the amounts owed; however, no definitive terms or extensions have been agreed to date. Oxford has also notified the Company that it is not\nwilling to discuss any new projects or arrangements until all outstanding invoices have been paid or a payment plan has been agreed to; has engaged a law firm to seek the\ncollection of the amounts owed, together with interest; and has threatened legal proceedings against us. While we are hopeful that we can come to mutually agreeable terms\nregarding a settlement, payment plan, and/or extension, with Oxford, we may not have sufficient funds to pay amounts due to Oxford in the near term, if at all, and Oxford may\ntake action against us, including filing legal proceedings against us seeking amounts due and interest, attempting to terminate their relationship with us, and/or filing a wind-up\npetition against one of the Company’s subsidiaries in the UK. If Oxford were to take legal action against us or terminate their relationship with us, we may be forced to scale\nback our business plan and/or seek bankruptcy protection. We may be subject to litigation and damages for our failure to pay amounts due to Oxford, and may be forced to pay\ninterest and penalties, which funds we do not currently have.\nKennedy License Agreement\nOn September 27, 2019, 180 LP entered into a license agreement (the “Kennedy License Agreement”) with the Kennedy Trust for Rheumatology Research\n(“Kennedy”) exclusively in the U.S., Japan, United Kingdom and countries of the EU, for certain licensed patents (the “Kennedy Licensed Patents”), including the right to\ngrant sublicenses, and the right to research, develop, sell or manufacture any pharmaceutical product (i) whose research, development, manufacture, use, importation or sale\nwould infringe the Kennedy Licensed Patents absent the license granted under the Kennedy License Agreement or (ii) containing an antibody that is a fragment of or derived\nfrom an antibody whose research, development, manufacture, use, importation or sale would infringe the Kennedy Licensed Patents absent the license granted under the\nKennedy License Agreement, for all human uses, including the diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of diseases and conditions.\nAs a consideration for the grant of the Kennedy Licensed Patents, 180 LP paid Kennedy an upfront fee of GBP £60,000, (USD $74,000) on November 22, 2019, which\nwas recognized as an intangible asset for the purchase of the licensed patents and is being amortized over the remaining life of the patents. 180 LP will also pay Kennedy\nroyalties equal to (i) 1% of the net sales for the first annual GBP £1 million (USD $1,283,400) of net sales, and (ii) 2% of the net sales after the net sales are at or in excess of\nGBP £1 million, as well as 25% of all sublicense revenue, provided that the amount of such percentage of sublicense revenue based on amounts which constitute royalties shall\nnot be less than 1% on the first cumulative GBP £1 million of net sales of the products sold by such sublicenses or their affiliates, and 2% on that portion of the cumulative net\nsales of the products sold by such sublicenses or their affiliates in excess of GBP £1 million.\nThe term of the royalties paid by the Company to Kennedy will expire on the later of (i) the last valid claim of a patent included in the Kennedy Licensed Patents\nwhich covers or claims the exploitation of a product in the applicable country; (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the product in the country; or (iii) 10 years from\nthe first commercial sale of the product in the country. The Kennedy License Agreement may be terminated without cause by providing a 90-day notice.\nF-31\nPetcanna Sub-License Agreement\nOn August 20, 2018, CBR Pharma entered into a sub-license agreement (the “Sub-License Agreement”) with its wholly owned subsidiary, Petcanna Pharma Corp.\n(“Petcanna”), of which the Company’s former Chief Financial Officer is a director. Petcanna is a private company with one common principal with the Company.\nPursuant to the terms of the Sub-license Agreement, the Company has granted a sub-license on the Licensed Patents to pursue development and commercialization for\nthe treatment of all veterinary conditions. In consideration, Petcanna will (a) issue 450,000 common shares of its share capital (the “Petcanna Shares”) 30 days after the\neffective date; and (b) pay royalties of 1% of net sales. The Company will be issued 85% and Yissum will be issued 15% of the 450,000 common shares of the Petcanna\nsubsidiary. The Petcanna shares are deemed to be founders shares with no value. The Petcanna shares have not been issued as of December 31, 2023.\nOperating Leases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an update to the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”). The new standard required most leases to be\nrecognized on the balance sheet as a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the present value of amounts expected to be\npaid over the lease term. Recognition of the costs of these leases on the income statement are disaggregated and recognized as both operating expense (for the amortization of\nthe right-of-use asset) and interest expense (for the portion of the lease payment related to interest). This standard was adopted by the Company upon issuance.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the Company can elect (by asset class) not to record on the balance sheet a lease whose term is 12 months or less and does not include a\npurchase option that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. If elected, the lease would be treated like an operating lease under previous GAAP; payments would be\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When determining whether the lease qualifies for this election, the Company would include renewal options only if they\nare considered part of the lease term, i.e., those options the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. If the lease term increases to more than 12 months, or if it is reasonably\ncertain the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company would no longer be able to apply this practical expedient and would apply ASC 842 guidance.\nRegarding leases (of which it currently has none), the Company would use the practical expedient for short-term operating leases that are 12 months or less. This\npractical expedient has been elected as a package and it would be applied consistently to all leases. Additionally, if the Company’s leases are considered operating in nature and\ntherefore not reflected on the balance sheet, the Company will recognize the short-term lease payments as rent/lease expense monthly on the income statement.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no leases as well as no lease or rent expense as of those dates.\nConsulting Agreements\nNanchahal Consulting Agreement\nOn February 22, 2021, the Company entered into a consultancy agreement (as amended, the “Consulting Agreement”) with a related party, Prof. Jagdeep Nanchahal\n(the “Consultant”). The Consulting Agreement was effective December 1, 2020.\nPursuant to the Consulting Agreement, the Company agreed to pay the Consultant 15,000 British Pounds (GBP) per month (approximately $20,800) during the term of\nthe agreement, increasing to 23,000 GBP per month (approximately $32,000) on the date (a) of publication of the data from the phase 2b clinical trial for Dupuytren’s\nContracture (RIDD) and (b) the date that the Company has successfully raised over $15 million in capital. The Company also agreed to pay the Consultant the following bonus\namounts:\n● the sum of £100,000 (approximately $138,000) upon submission of the Dupuytren’s Contracture clinical trial data for publication in a peer-reviewed journal\n(“Bonus 1”);\n● the sum of £434,673 GBP (approximately $605,000) (“Bonus 2”), which is earned and payable upon the Company raising a minimum of $15 million in additional\nfunding, through the sale of debt or equity, after December 1, 2020 (the “Vesting Date”). Bonus 2 is payable within 30 days of the Vesting Date and shall not be\naccrued, due or payable prior to the Vesting Date. Bonus 2 is payable, at the election of the Consultant, at least 50% (fifty percent) in shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock, at the lower of (i) $1,140.00 per share, or (ii) the trading price on the date of the grant, with the remainder paid in GBP;\n● the sum of £5,000 (approximately $7,000) on enrollment of the first patient to the phase 2 frozen shoulder trial (“Bonus 3”); and\n● the sum of £5,000 (approximately $7,000) for enrollment of the first patient to the phase 2 delirium/POCD trial (“Bonus 4”).\nF-32\nThe Consulting Agreement has an initial term of three years, and renews thereafter for additional three-year terms, until terminated as provided in the agreement. The\nConsulting Agreement can be terminated by either party with 12 months prior written notice (provided the Company’s right to terminate the agreement may only be exercised if\nthe Consultant fails to perform his required duties under the Consulting Agreement), or by the Company immediately under certain conditions specified in the Consulting\nAgreement if (a) the Consultant fails or neglects efficiently and diligently to perform the services required thereunder or is guilty of any breach of its or his obligations under\nthe agreement (including any consent granted under it); (b) the Consultant is guilty of any fraud or dishonesty or acts in a manner (whether in the performance of the services or\notherwise) which, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, has brought or is likely to bring the Consultant, the Company or any of its affiliates into disrepute or is convicted\nof an arrestable offence (other than a road traffic offence for which a non-custodial penalty is imposed); or (c) the Consultant becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or\ncomposition with his creditors. If the Consulting Agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason other than cause, the Consultant is entitled to a lump sum payment of\n12 months of his fee as of the date of termination.\nEffective March 30, 2021, in satisfaction of amounts owed to the Consultant for 50% of Bonus 2, the Company issued 265 shares of the Company’s common stock to\nthe Consultant. Additionally, on April 15, 2021, in satisfaction of amounts owed to the Consultant for an additional 19% of Bonus 2, the Company issued 100 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock to the Consultant.\nEffective August 27, 2021, in satisfaction of amounts owed to the Consultant for the remainder of Bonus 2, the Company issued 162 shares of the Company’s common\nstock to the Consultant since the Company raised $15 million in a financing transaction, as per the agreement. All issuances were made under the Company’s 2020 Omnibus\nIncentive Plan. See Note 10 – Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity.\nIn December 2021, the Dupuytren’s Contracture clinical trial data was submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal and Bonus 1 was paid to the Consultant.\nOn April 27, 2022, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Consulting Agreement, whereby upon acceptance of the data for the Phase 2b clinical trial for\nDupuytren’s Contracture for publication, the Consultant’s monthly fee will increase to £23,000, provided that £4,000 of such increase will be accrued and £19,000 of such fees\nwill be payable monthly per the payroll practices of the Company in cash effective March 1, 2022 and until the earlier of (a) November 1, 2022 or (b) the date upon which the\nCompany has sufficient cash on hand to pay the accrued amount, which the Company expects will not be until it has raised a minimum of $15,000,000 (the “Funding\nDetermination Date”), at which time the accrued amount will be due.\nOn December 28, 2022, the Company entered into an Amendment to the Consulting Agreement, whereby the Consultant’s monthly fee will increase to £35,000\nbeginning on January 1, 2023 until the end of the term of the agreement; if the agreement is terminated by the Company for any reason other than cause, the consultant will be\nentitled to a lump sum payment of 12 months of his monthly fee as of the date of termination.\nFeldmann Consulting Agreements\nOn June 1, 2018, CannBioRex Pharma Limited (“CannBioRex”) and Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann Ph.D., our Executive Co-Chairman, entered into a consulting\nagreement; pursuant to the agreement, Prof. Sir Feldmann serves as the Chairman, CEO and Executive Director of CannBioRex or in such other capacity consistent with his\nstatus. Prof. Sir Feldmann receives compensation of £115,000 per year, with annual compensation reviewed by the Board and eligibility for discretionary bonuses, as\ndetermined by the Board. CannBioRex also reimburses Prof. Sir Feldmann’s travelling and other business expenses.\nThe agreement contains a customary non-compete clause prohibiting Prof. Sir Feldmann from working for any competing businesses during the term of his\nemployment, or holding equity in other businesses, except he may hold or beneficially own securities of publicly-traded companies if the aggregate beneficial interests of him\nand his family does not exceed 5% of that class of securities. The agreement does not have a fixed term, and either party may terminate the agreement by delivering written\nnotice 9 months in advance. CannBioRex may also terminate the agreement at any time with immediate effect by giving written notice. If CannBioRex terminates Prof. Sir\nFeldmann’s employment without providing 9 months written notice, he will become entitled to a payment equal to his basic salary he would have been entitled to receive if 9\nmonths’ notice were given.\nF-33\nOn November 17, 2021, the Board, as recommended by the Compensation Committee, increased the salary of Prof. Sir Feldmann to $225,000 per annum.\nEffective on April 27, 2022, CannBioRex and Prof. Sir Feldmann entered into an amendment to the consulting agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed\neffective March 1, 2022, that Sir Feldmann’s paid salary would be reduced by $225,000 (100%), and that the reduction would be accrued for and paid on a future date.

On December 15,\n2022, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), with the Stockholder Authority, approved an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation to affect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment filed to affect the\nReverse Stock Split, the Reverse Stock Split was effective on December 19, 2022 and the shares of the Company’s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital\nMarket (“NASDAQ”) on a post-split basis on December 19, 2022, with new CUSIP number: 68236V203. No change was made to the trading symbol for the Company’s shares\nof common stock or public warrants, “ATNF” and “ATNFW”, respectively, in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.\nBecause the Certificate of Amendment did not reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock, the effect of the Reverse Stock Split was to increase the\nnumber of shares of common stock available for issuance relative to the number of shares issued and outstanding. The Reverse Stock Split did not alter the par value of the\ncommon stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of the common stock. Any fractional shares remaining after the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the nearest\nwhole share.\nWith regards to the Company’s 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Company’s Compensation Committee and Board deem it in\nthe best interests of the Company and its stockholders to (i) adjust the number of shares of Company common stock available for issuance under the Incentive Plans downward\nby a factor of 20 (with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole share); (ii) reduce the number of shares of common stock issuable upon each outstanding option\nto purchase shares of common stock of the Company, and all other outstanding awards, by a factor of 20 (with any fractional shares rounded down to the nearest whole share);\nand (iii) adjust the exercise price of any outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock previously granted under the Incentive Plans up by a factor of 20 (rounded up\nto the nearest whole cent), in each case to adjust equitably for the Exchange Ratio of the Reverse Stock Split, which such adjustments effective automatically upon\neffectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split. The effects of the one-for-twenty reverse stock split have been retroactively reflected throughout the financial statements and notes to\nthe financial statements.\nReverse Stock Split during 2024\nOn February 16, 2024, at a Special Meeting of the Stockholders of the Company, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s Second\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per\nshare, by a ratio of between one-for-four to one-for-forty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be determined by our Board of Directors or a duly\nauthorized committee thereof in its discretion, at any time after approval of the amendment and prior to February 16, 2025. On February 16, 2024, the Company’s Board\napproved an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-19. Pursuant to\nthe Certificate of Amendment filed to affect the Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse Stock Split was effective on February 28, 2024 and the shares of the Company’s common\nstock began trading on NASDAQ on a post-split basis on February 28, 2024, with new CUSIP number: 68236V302. No change was made to the trading symbol for the\nCompany’s shares of common stock or public warrants, “ATNF” and “ATNFW”, respectively, in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.\nIn addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options and other equity awards (including shares reserved for issuance under the\nCompany’s equity compensation plans) were proportionately adjusted by the applicable administrator, using the 1-for-19 ratio, and rounded down to the nearest whole share.\nThe conversion rates of the Company’s preferred stock (of which none are outstanding) will also be adjusted in a ratio of 1-for-19. The number of shares issuable upon exercise\nof the Company’s outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock outstanding will also be equitably adjusted pursuant to the terms of such securities in connection\nwith the 1-for-19 Reverse Stock Split. In addition, the exercise price for each outstanding stock option and warrant will be increased in inverse proportion to the 1-for-19 split\nratio such that upon an exercise, the aggregate exercise price payable by the optionee or warrant holder to the Company for the shares subject to the option or warrant will\nremain approximately the same as the aggregate exercise price prior to the Reverse Stock Split, subject to the terms of such securities.\nF-38\nFurther, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Class K Special Voting Shares (the “Voting Stock”), following the Effective Time, the Voting Stock was convertible\ninto a number of shares of common stock equal to, and votes a number of voting shares equal to, 14 shares; provided that such Class K Special Voting Shares were\nsubsequently converted into 14 shares of common stock on March 14, 2024.\nEach stockholder’s percentage ownership interest in the Company and proportional voting power remains virtually unchanged as a result of the Reverse Stock Split,\nexcept for minor changes and adjustments that will result from rounding fractional shares into whole shares. The rights and privileges of the holders of shares of common stock\nwill be substantially unaffected by the Reverse Stock Split.\nPreferred Stock\nPursuant to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation filed on November 6, 2020, the Company has 5,000,000 preferred shares\nauthorized at a par value of $0.0001 per share, of which 1,000,000 shares are designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”), 1 share is designated as\nthe Class K Special Voting Share and 1 share is designated as the Class C Special Voting Share.

As of December 31, 2023, there is no Series A Preferred issued or outstanding; there is one Class K Special Voting Share and one Class C\nSpecial Voting Share issued and outstanding. As of the date of this Report, there are no Series A Preferred, Class K Special Voting Shares or Class C Special Voting Shares\noutstanding.\nThe Special Voting Shares have a par value of $0.0001 per share. The rights and preferences of each Special Voting Shares consists of the following:\n● the right to vote in all circumstances in which our common stock have the right to vote, with the common stock as one class;\n● the Special Voting Shares entitle the holder Odyssey Trust Company (the Trustee) to an aggregate number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock\nthat were issuable to the holders of the previously outstanding shares of CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC and/or Katexco Purchaseco ULC, Canadian subsidiaries of\n180 (the “Exchangeable Shares”);\n● the holder of the Special Voting Shares (and, indirectly, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares) has the same rights as the holders of the common stock as to\nnotices, reports, financial statements and attendance at all stockholder meetings;\n● no entitlement to dividends;\n● the holder of the Special Voting Shares is not entitled to any portion of any related distribution upon windup, dissolution or liquidation of the Company; and\n● the Company may cancel the Special Voting Shares when there are no Exchangeable Shares outstanding and no option or other commitment of CannBioRex\nPurchaseco ULC and Katexco Purchaseco ULC which could require either CannBioRex Purchaseco ULC and Katexco Purchaseco ULC to issue more\nExchangeable Shares.\nAs set forth above, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares, through the applicable Special Voting Share, have voting rights and other attributes corresponding to the\ncommon stock.

Although the April 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have a tender offer provision, the April 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants were determined to be equity-classified because\nthey met the limited exception in the case of a change-in-control. Because the April 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants are equity-classified, the placement agent fees and offering\nexpenses were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital.\nThe April 2023 Common Warrants have an exercise price equal to $33.82 per share, were immediately exercisable upon the closing of the April 2023 Offering (the\n“Initial Exercise Date”) and are subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments for stock splits or dividends or other similar transactions. The exercise price of the April 2023\nCommon Warrants will not be subject to adjustment as a result of subsequent equity issuances at effective prices lower than the then-current exercise price. The April 2023\nCommon Warrants were originally exercisable for 5.5 years following the Initial Exercise Date. The April 2023 Common Warrants are subject to a provision prohibiting the\nexercise of such April 2023 Common Warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, the holder of such April 2023 Common Warrants (together with the\nholder’s affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the holder’s affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the\nCompany’s outstanding common stock (which may be increased or decreased, with 61 days prior written notice by the holder). Although the April 2023 Common Warrants\nhave a tender offer provision, the April 2023 Common Warrants were determined to be equity-classified because they met the limited exception in the case of a change-in-\ncontrol. Because the April 2023 Common Warrants are equity-classified, the placement agent fees and offering expenses were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in\ncapital.\nDuring 2023, the Company entered into a series of amendments to these warrants in August and November; such amendments changed the exercise price from $33.82\nto $15.77 (see Second Amendment to Common Warrant Agreements for the July 2022, December 2022 and April 2023 Offerings section below), and $3.23 (see Amendment to\nthe August 2023 Offering section below), respectively. As of December 31, 2023, these warrants are not exercisable until the Company obtains stockholder approval with\nrespect to the 734,262 shares of common stock upon exercise of warrants issued in connection with the Amendment to the August 2023 Offering (see Amendment to the August\n2023 Offering section below), at which point the December 2022 Common Warrants will remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the stockholder approval date. The\nstockholder approval date occurred on February 16, 2024, as discussed under Note 13 – Subsequent Events.\nAs of December 31, 2023, all 61,615 of the April 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have been exercised for a value of $117; and there are no unexercised April 2023 Pre-\nFunded Warrants remaining as of the end of 2023.

The Company accounted for the amendment as a warrant modification, whereby the effect of the modification is measured as the\ndifference in its relative fair value immediately before the modification and after the modification; and any increase to the relative fair value is recognized as an equity issuance\ncost.\nTo assess for the change in relative fair value, the Company performed a Black Scholes Option Model calculation to quantify the fair value of the common warrants\nunder their original terms as of the modification date using the following assumptions: a share price of $27.17, exercise prices of $402.80 and $66.50 for the July 2022 common\nwarrants and December 2022 common warrants, respectively, an expected term of 4.8 and 5.2 years, respectively, volatility of 106%, a dividend rate of 0% and a discount rate\nof 3.36%. The Company then performed a Black Scholes Option Model calculation to quantify the fair value of the common warrants with their new modified terms as of the\nmodification date using the following assumptions: a share price of $27.17, an exercise price of $33.82 for both the July 2022 common warrants and December 2022 common\nwarrants, an expected term of 5.5 years, volatility of 106%, a dividend rate of 0% and a discount rate of 3.36%. The aggregate difference of approximately $0.8 million between\nthe two calculated amounts was recorded as an equity issuance cost within equity during the period to account for the change in relative fair value.\nF-42\nFirst Amendment to the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nAt the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held on July 6, 2023, the stockholders of the Company approved the First Amendment (“First\nAmendment”) to the 180 Life Sciences Corp. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended by the First Amendment, the “OIP”). The First\nAmendment was originally approved by the Board of Directors of the Company on May 5, 2023, subject to stockholder approval and the First Amendment became effective at\nthe time of stockholder approval. The First Amendment increased the maximum number of shares available to be issued under the OIP from 6,315 shares to 24,736 shares.\nAugust 2023 Offering\nOn August 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor, in addition to certain purchasers who relied on the\nCompany’s registration statement filed with the SEC on July 25, 2023, which became effective on August 9, 2023, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate\nof 35,102 shares of common stock (the “August Shares”), pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 207,814 shares of common stock, and common stock warrants\nto purchase up to an aggregate of 242,915 shares of common stock (“August Pre-funded Warrants”) at a combined purchase price of $12.35 per share and warrant (the “August\n2023 Offering”). Aggregate gross proceeds from the August 2023 Offering were approximately $3.0 million, and the August 2023 Offering closed on August 14, 2023.\nThe August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price equal to $0.0019, are immediately exercisable and are subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments for\nstock splits or dividends or other similar transactions. The exercise price of the August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants will not be subject to adjustment as a result of subsequent\nequity issuances at effective prices lower than the then-current exercise price. The August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable until they are exercised in full. The August\n2023 Pre-Funded Warrants are subject to a provision prohibiting the exercise of such August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise,\nthe holder of such August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants (together with the holder’s affiliates, and any other persons acting as a group together with the holder or any of the\nholder’s affiliates), would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock (which may be increased or decreased, with 61 days prior written\nnotice by the holder). Although the August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants have a tender offer provision, the August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants were determined to be equity-\nclassified because they met the limited exception in the case of a change-in-control. Because the August 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants are equity-classified, the placement agent\nfees and offering expenses were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital.\nThe August 2023 Common Warrants have an exercise price equal to $12.35 per share, are immediately exercisable upon the closing of the August 2023 Offering and\nare subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments for stock splits or dividends or other similar transactions. The exercise price of the August 2023 Common Warrants will not\nbe subject to adjustment as a result of subsequent equity issuances at effective prices lower than the then-current exercise price.

Because\nthe August 2023 Common Warrants are equity-classified, the placement agent fees and offering expenses were accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital.\nDuring 2023, the Company entered into a series of amendments to these warrants in August and November; such amendments changed the exercise price from $12.35\nto $3.23 (see Amendment to the August 2023 Offering section below). As of December 31, 2023, these warrants are not exercisable until the Company obtains stockholder\napproval with respect to the 734,262 shares of common stock upon exercise of warrants issued in connection with the Amendment to the August 2023 Offering (see Amendment\nto the August 2023 Offering section below), at which point the December 2022 Common Warrants will remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the stockholder approval\ndate.

The Company accounted for the amendment as a warrant modification, whereby the effect of the modification is measured as the difference\nin its relative fair value immediately before the modification and after the modification; and any increase to the relative fair value is recognized as an equity issuance cost.\nTo assess for the change in relative fair value, the Company performed a Black Scholes Option Model calculation to quantify the fair value of the common warrants\nunder their original terms as of the modification date using the following assumptions for the July 2022, December 2022 and April 2023 common warrants: a share price of\n$16.04, an exercise price of $33.82, an expected term of 5.18 years, volatility of 100%, a dividend rate of 0% and a discount rate of 4.12%. The Company then performed a\nBlack Scholes Option Model calculation to quantify the fair value of the common warrants with their new modified terms as of the modification date using the following\nassumptions for the July 2022, December 2022 and April 2023 common warrants: a share price of $16.04, an exercise price of $15.77, an expected term of 5.18 years, volatility\nof 100%, a dividend rate of 0% and a discount rate of 4.12%. The aggregate difference of approximately $1.4 million between the two calculated amounts was recorded as an\nequity issuance cost within equity during the period to account for the change in relative fair value.\nAmendment to August 2023 Offering\nOn November 28, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the August 2023 Offering (“Amendment to the August 2023 Offering”), whereby (i) the Purchaser\nagreed to pay an additional $830,769 in connection with the repricing of the August Shares and August Pre-Funded Warrants (the “Repricing Amount”), (ii) the Company\nagreed to issue to the Purchaser additional pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 257,205 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $0.0019 per share (the “Additional\nPre- Funded Warrants”), and warrants to purchase up to 477,058 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $3.23 per share (the “Additional Common Warrants”,\ncollectively the “Additional Warrants”), and (iii) the Company and the Purchaser agreed to enter into the warrant amendment agreement (as defined and described below).\nOther than exercise price and exercisability, the Additional Warrants have the same terms and conditions as the August 2023 Pre-funded Warrants and the August 2023\nCommon Warrants and, as such, were determined to be equity-classified because they met the limited exception in the case of a change-in-control. Because the Additional\nWarrants are equity-classified, the placement agent fees and offering expenses will be accounted for as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The Additional Warrants will\nnot be exercisable until the Company obtains stockholder approval with respect to the issuance of the 734,262 shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants, at which\npoint the Additional Pre-Funded Warrants will remain exercisable until all the Additional Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full, and the Additional Common Warrants will\nremain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the stockholder approval date. The stockholder approval date occurred on February 16, 2024, as discussed under Note 13 –\nSubsequent Events.\nIn accordance with the Amendment to the August 2023 Offering, the Company entered into a warrant amendment agreement to amend the following outstanding\nwarrants held by the Purchaser: (i) warrants to purchase up to 16,138 shares of common stock issued in July 2022; (ii) warrants to purchase up to 135,339 shares of common\nstock issued in December 2022; (iii) warrants to purchase up to 82,668 shares of common stock issued in April 2023; and (iv) warrants to purchase up to 242,915 shares of\ncommon stock issued in August 2023 (collectively, the “Existing Common Warrants”). Pursuant to the warrant amendment agreement, the Existing Common Warrants will not\nbe exercisable until the Company obtains stockholder approval for the issuance of up to 477,058 shares of common stock upon exercise of the Existing Common Warrants. The\nExisting Common Warrants will have an exercise price equal to $3.23 per share, and the Existing Common Warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of the stockholder\napproval date. The stockholder approval date occurred on February 16, 2024, as discussed under Note 13 – Subsequent Events.\nThe Company accounted for the Amendment to the August 2023 Offering as a warrant modification, whereby the effect of the modification is measured as the\ndifference in its relative fair value immediately before the modification and after the modification; and any increase to the relative fair value is recognized as an equity issuance\ncost.\nF-44\nTo assess for the change in relative fair value, the Company performed a Black Scholes Option Model calculation to quantify the fair value of the common warrants\nunder their original terms as of the modification date using the following assumptions for the July 2022, December 2022, April 2023 and August 2023 common warrants: a\nshare price of $6.46, an exercise price of $15.77 for the July 2022, December 2022 and April 2023 common warrants and an exercise price of $12.35 for the August 2023\ncommon warrants, an expected term of 5.22 years, volatility of 100%, a dividend rate of 0% and a discount rate of 4.29%.

The\nplan of compliance was subsequently submitted by the Company to Nasdaq on November 9, 2023, and on November 14, 2023, Nasdaq granted the Company an extension,\nuntil December 15, 2023, to complete certain transactions set forth in the plan of compliance, in order to remedy its prior violation of Nasdaq rules as described in the October\n11, 2023 letter from Nasdaq.\nAs disclosed in greater detail above, on November 29, 2023, the Company undertook several transactions, including amending the terms of the Common Warrants to\nnot be exercisable until the Company’s stockholders approve such issuance in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, in order to regain compliance with Listing Rule\n5635(d)(1)(A)).\nAs a result of those transactions, on December 14, 2023, Nasdaq provided the Company written notice that the Company has fulfilled the terms of the prior extension;\nis in compliance with Listing Rule 5635(d)(1)(A)); and that the matter is now closed.\nNotification of Failure to Comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that its stockholders’ equity as reported in its Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2023 (the “Form 10-Q”), did not meet the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000. In the Company’s\nForm 10-Q, the Company reported a stockholders’ deficit of ($149,327), which is below the minimum stockholders’ equity required for continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq\nListing Rule 5550(b)(1). Additionally, as of the date of this Report, the Company does not meet the alternative Nasdaq continued listing standards under Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nF-48\nThis notice of noncompliance has had no immediate impact on the continued listing or trading of the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market, which\nwill continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq, subject to the Company’s compliance with the other continued listing requirements. Nasdaq has given the Company until\nJanuary 2, 2024 to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance. We submitted the plan to regain compliance in a timely manner, and on January 11, 2024, Nasdaq advised the\nCompany that it has determined to grant the Company an extension to regain compliance with the Rule. See Note 13 – Subsequent Events.\nNOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company is subject to federal and state/provincial income taxes in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom and each legal entity files on a non-\nconsolidated basis. The benefit of the pre-reorganization net operating losses of 180 LP were passed through to its owners.\nThe losses before income taxes consist of the following domestic and international components:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nDomestic $ (20,025,289) $ (37,727,021)\nInternational (2,259,237) (1,941,987)\n$ (22,284,526) $ (39,669,008)\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following benefits:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax benefits:\nDomestic:\nFederal $ 4,004,891 $ 4,057,936\nState 1,399,496 1,343,123\nInternational 591,583 353,038\n5,995,970 5,754,097\nChange in valuation allowance (3,646,556) (4,811,348)\nNet income tax benefit $ 2,349,414 $ 942,749\nF-49\nCertain deferred tax assets are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar and are subject to foreign currency translation adjustments.

The federal NOLs have no expiration date and are subject to 80% of taxable income; the state\nNOLs will begin to expire in 2039;\n● Approximately $8,589,000 each of Canadian federal and provincial NOLs. Those NOLs will begin to expire in 2038; and\n● Approximately $12,759,000 of United Kingdom federal NOLs. Those NOLs have no expiration date.\nThe utilization of the domestic NOLs to offset future taxable income may be subject to annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar\nstate statutes as a result of ownership changes.\nThe Company has assessed the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740. ASC 740 requires that such review\nconsiders all available positive and negative evidence, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. ASC\n740 requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is “more likely than not” that all, or a portion of, deferred tax assets will not be realized. After the performance of\nsuch reviews as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, management believes that uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of its deferred tax assets and has, therefore,\nestablished a full valuation allowance. The Company recorded increases in the valuation allowance of $3,646,557 and $5,944,246 in connection with the tax provisions for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nManagement has evaluated and concluded that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s consolidated financial statements\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company does not expect any significant changes in its unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date.\nNo tax audits were commenced or were in process during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, nor were any tax related interest or penalties incurred during\nthose periods. The Company’s tax returns filed in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom since inception remain subject to examination.\nNOTE 12 - RELATED PARTIES\nAccounts Payable – Related Parties\nAccounts payable - related parties were $266,009 and $0 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and consist of amounts due to certain officers and directors\nof the Company, as well as deferred compensation for certain executives. For the accounts payable – related party balance as of December 31, 2023, approximately $210,000\nrelates to income taxes payable to the U.K. government for the salary of Prof. Sir Marc Feldmann, who serves as the Chairman, CEO and Executive Director of CannBioRex.\nAccrued Expenses - Related Parties\nAccrued expenses - related parties were $0 and $188,159 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and consist of interest accrued on loans and convertible\nnotes due to certain officers and directors of the Company, as well as deferred compensation for certain executives.\nF-51\nResearch and Development Expenses - Related Parties\nResearch and Development Expenses – Related Parties of $480,777 and $240,731 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is related to\nconsulting and professional fees paid to current or former officers, directors or greater than 10% investors, or affiliates thereof.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses - Related Parties\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses – Related Parties during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were $46,555 and $5,612, respectively.

Except for the following,\nthere are no subsequent events identified that would require disclosure in the financial statements.\nAmendments to Compensation Agreements\nOn January 10, 2024, and effective on January 1, 2024, the Company entered into (a) a Fourth Amendment to Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Dr.\nWoody, the CEO and Director of the Company; (b) a Fourth Amendment to Employment Agreement with Dr. Rothbard, the Chief Science Officer (CSO) of the Company; (c) a\nThird Amendment to Consulting Agreement with Dr. Steinman, the Executive Chairman of the Company; and (d) a Second Amendment to Consulting Agreement with Prof. Sir\nFeldmann, the former Executive Co-Chairman of the Company (collectively, the “Amendments”), which each amended the compensation agreements then in place with such\nindividuals (see Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies).\nPursuant to the Amendments, each of Dr. Woody and Dr. Rothbard, effective as of January 1, 2024, agreed to a reduction of the base salaries set forth in their\nrespective amended employment agreements, by 50%, to $245,000 per year for Dr. Woody and to $100,000 per year for Dr. Rothbard, with the amount of such salary\nreductions ($20,416 per month for Dr. Woody and $8,333 per month for Dr. Rothbard), accruing monthly in arrears, to be paid upon the Company raising at least $5,000,000 in\nfunding subsequent to the date of the Amendments (the “Funding Date”), provided that in the event the Funding Date does not occur prior to March 15, 2025, the amounts\naccrued will be forgiven in their entirety.\nAlso pursuant to the Amendments, each of Dr. Steinman and Sir Feldmann, effective as of January 1, 2024, agreed to a reduction of the base salaries set forth in their\nrespective consulting agreements, by 100%, to $0 per year for each of Dr. Steinman and Sir Feldmann, with the amount of such salary reductions ($18,750 per month or\n$225,000 per year, for Dr. Steinman and £14,167 per month or £170,000 per year, for Sir Feldmann), accruing monthly in arrears, to be paid on the Funding Date, provided that\nin the event the Funding Date does not occur prior to March 15, 2025, the amounts accrued will be forgiven in their entirety.\nGranting of Extension to Regain Nasdaq Compliance\nAs previously disclosed in Note 10 – Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance\nwith the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Rule”) requires companies listed\non the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000. On January 11, 2024, Nasdaq advised the Company that it had determined to grant the\nCompany an extension to regain compliance with the Rule.\nThe terms of the extension are as follows: on or before May 13, 2024, the Company must complete certain transactions described in greater detail in the compliance\nplan, contemplated to result in the Company increasing its stockholders’ equity to more than $2.5 million, and opt for one of the two alternatives to evidence compliance with\nthe Rule. Additionally, in either case the Company is required to disclose that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company’s ongoing compliance with the stockholders’ equity\nrequirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting. Regardless of which alternative the\nCompany chooses, if the Company fails to evidence compliance upon filing its next periodic report with the SEC following the end of such compliance period (i.e., its\nQuarterly Report for the Quarter ended June 30, 2024), the Company may be subject to delisting.\nF-52\nReversal of Accrued Bonuses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had a balance of $1,053,006 in accrued bonuses due to the Board of Directors for services rendered during the\nfiscal years 2023 and 2022; of this amount, approximately $590,000 and $460,000 relate to services rendered during the current and prior years, respectively. On January 29,\n2024, it was determined during a board meeting that the Company would not be paying these bonuses and would not be awarding any bonuses during 2024; and as a result, the\nCompany subsequently determined that this event should be recognized in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and recorded an entry to reverse the\naccrued balances. This reversal is reflected in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nD&O Insurance Lawsuit\nOn February 12, 2024, the judge in the Company’s pending lawsuit in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California, San Jose Division, granted a Motion for\nPartial Summary Judgment against AmTrust International Underwriters DAC (“AmTrust”), which was the premerger directors’ and officers’ insurance policy underwriter for\nthe Company and the Company’s excess insurance carrier, Freedom Specialty Insurance Company (“Freedom”), and ordered as follows:\n(a) AmTrust is obligated under its insurance policy with the Company to advance to the Company all defense costs in excess of the deductible that the Company\nhas advanced or will advance to Dr. Marlene Krauss, the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Director, and George Hornig, the former Chairman\nof the Board of Directors, in connection with certain subpoenas issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and\n(b) upon exhaustion of the AmTrust insurance policy, Freedom is obligated to do the same pursuant to its excess liability insurance policy with the Company.\nThis Order applies until the final disposition of the case, but does not constitute a final judgment, and both the Company and the two insurers retain their rights to\ncontest all applicable issues at trial, which is scheduled for May 12, 2025.\nIt is unclear whether the defendants will take steps to appeal this order, the outcome of any such appeal, the timing of our receipt of any funds we may receive pursuant\nto the order related to reimbursement of amounts related to the Securities and Commission subpoenas, if any, or such amounts that we may ultimately receive.\nA final judgment following trial could potentially confirm these obligations of the insurers or, alternatively, reverse and require the Company to repay all or certain\nportions of such advance payments. There is no assurance at this time as to what the final judgment may entail.\nSecond Amendment to the 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nOn February 16, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders as of December 18, 2023 and approved the adoption of the Second Amendment to the\n180 Life Sciences Corp. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Such amendment increased the maximum number of shares available to be issued under the Plan from 470,000 shares to\n4,249,933 shares.\nSpecial Stockholder’s Meeting/Reverse Stock Split\nOn February 16, 2024, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders as of December 18, 2023 to vote on three proposals: i) approval of an amendment to the\nSecond Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, by\na ratio of between one-for-four to one-for-forty, inclusive, with the exact ratio to be set at a whole number to be determined by the board of directors, ii) approval of the\nadoption of the Second Amendment to the 180 Life Sciences Corp. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan and iii) approval of the issuance of shares of common stock, $0.0001 par\nvalue per share, in excess of 19.99% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, upon the exercise of pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 257,205 shares of\ncommon stock, with an exercise price of $0.0019 per share; and warrants to purchase up to 954,116 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $3.23 per share, at a\nprice less than the minimum price as defined by and in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). All proposals were approved.\nOn February 16, 2024, the Company’s board of directors approved a reverse split ratio of one-for-nineteen, with any fractional shares remaining after the reverse split\nto be rounded up to the nearest whole share. The Company believes the split is necessary to maintain the listing of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market,\nand to cure the Company’s current non-compliance with Nasdaq Capital Market listing rules; the board also believes that the reverse split will also improve the marketability\nand liquidity of the common stock.\nOn February 26, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate\nof Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect the reverse stock split. Pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment, the reverse stock split was\neffective on February 28, 2024 at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time (the “Effective Time”). The shares of the Company’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market\n(“Nasdaq”) on a post-split basis on February 28, 2024, with new CUSIP number: 68236V302. No change was made to the trading symbol for the Company’s shares of common\nstock or public warrants, “ATNF” and “ATNFW”, respectively, in connection with the reverse stock split.\nF-53\nNew Board Members Appointed\nOn February 28, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Blair Jordan as a member of the Board, and on March 7, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors\nappointed Omar Jimenez and Ryan L. Smith as members of the Board. At the same time, the Board set the number of members of the Board at five members. The Board\ndetermined that Mr. Jordan, Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Smith were each independent and not party to any material plan, contract or arrangement (whether or not written) with the\nCompany. In connection with their appointments to the Board and on February 24, 2024, March 4, 2024 and March 5, 2024, to be effective upon their appointments to the\nBoard, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Jordan, Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Smith, respectively, whereby each will be paid $40,000 per year as an annual retainer fee\nfor serving on the Board, and $10,000 per year for serving as the Chairman of the Strategic and Alternatives Committee and $15,000 per year for serving as the Lead Director\n(Mr. Jordan); $10,000 per year for serving as Chairman of the Audit Committee (Mr. Jimenez); and $10,000 per year for serving as the Chairman of the Compensation\nCommittee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (Mr. Smith). The Company agreed to make an initial fee payment of $7,500 to Mr. Jordan in connection\nwith his appointment to the Board, and subsequent fee payments quarterly in arrears, and pro-rated for partial quarters. A total of one half of such aggregate cash compensation\nwill be accrued until such time as the Company raises an aggregate of $1 million from any source, including but not limited to debt and/or equity raises, quasi-equity raises,\nreceipt of insurance proceeds, litigation proceeds, and corporate transactions.\nResignation of Board Member\nOn March 7, 2024, Sir Marc Feldmann, Ph.D. provided notice to the Board of Directors of his resignation as a member of the Board of Directors, effective on the same\ndate. Sir Feldmann’s resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices, or otherwise. Prior to his\nresignation, Sir Feldmann served as Co-Executive Chairman of the Company but did not serve on any committees of the Board of Directors. Sir Feldmann will continue to\nserve as an employee of one of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nPre-Funded Warrant Exercises\nDuring February and March 2024, the remaining additional pre-funded warrants from the Amendment to the August 2023 Offering were exercised at a price of\n$0.0019 per share and, as a result, the holder was issued 257,205 shares of common stock (see Note 10 – Stockholder’s (Deficit) Equity, August 2023 Offering for further\ndetails).\nNasdaq Compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) Regained\nOn September 7, 2023, Nasdaq staff notified the Company that its common stock failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 over the previous 30 consecutive\nbusiness days as required by the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market. Since then, the staff has determined that for the last 10 consecutive business days, from February\n28 to March 12, 2024, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock has been at $1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with\nListing Rule 5550(a)(2) and this matter is now closed.\nConversion of Class K Special Voting Shares\nOn March 12, 2024, a holder of Class K Special Voting Shares converted such shares into 14 shares of common stock of the Company in a transaction exempt from\nregistration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. As a result of such conversion, there are no longer any Class K Special Voting Shares.\nF-54\nExhibit 23.1\nINDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM’S CONSENT\nWe consent to the incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement of 180 Life Sciences Corp.
