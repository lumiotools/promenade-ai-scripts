Please note that any opinions, estimates or forecasts regarding Evotec's performance made by these analysts are theirs alone and do not represent opinions, estimates or forecasts of Evotec or_ its management. The above reference to the analysts does not imply that Evotec endorses their opinions. Evotec is under no obligation to update or supplement the information provided above and does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this list. \n\n_Copies of the reports from the analysts listed above can be obtained directly from the analysts or their employers. Due to legal requirements, Evotec is not allowed to publish the analyst reports._\n\n##  Evotec's Dividend Policy \n\nThe payment of dividends depends on Evotec’s financial situation and liquidity requirements, general market conditions, and statutory, tax and regulatory requirements. \n\nEvotec has never paid or declared any cash dividends on its ordinary shares, and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends on its ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Evotec intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings and reinvest them in the company’s further growth strategy to better leverage long-term growth and sustainability.\n\nUnder German law, Evotec may pay dividends only from the distributable profit (Bilanzgewinn) reflected in its unconsolidated financial statements (as opposed to the consolidated financial statements for Evotec and its subsidiaries) prepared in accordance with the principles set forth in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and adopted by the Evotec Management Board (Vorstand) and the Supervisory Board (Aufsichtsrat), or, as the case may be, by the shareholders of Evotec in a general shareholders’ meeting. In addition, under German law Evotec may not pay dividends before annual profits exceed the losses carried forward. \n\nAll of the shares represented by the ADSs offered in USA generally have the same dividend rights as all of Evotec's other outstanding shares.\n\n## Contact Us\n\n![Volker Braun](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/authorImages/_contactImage/Volker_Braun_EDT_V2_RSZ.jpg)\n\n####  Investor Relations \n\ninvestorrelations@evotec.com\n\n[vCard](https://www.evotec.com/index.php?p=actions/vcard/default/index&vcard=k2L_d5GWkL1g7bx9OykNr2sy9555ftKZOHGJzgcW20rjg8i0TYOAyVLwiY19m1nHTJLQkGcnjbAiJZTe9eu638S52ZdeMkkZ1JpoaTlp-N2RV66t-x11l7jAV7O73rrsonXQTOYgP_NK7Feu5Drl1_B1PHAyd2GlIoWAynuLK8X4FgyzB1CN-oIr7oEXWyqFDEsTIZmUeDCF3WDpur7oaUnew3OCMSoCg23kEe30HSE)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.evotec.com/en/contact)\n\n![Logo Evotec white](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Internal_Logos/_contactCompanyLogo/RZ_Logo_Evotec_220829_RGB_white.png)\n\nEvotec has the right technologies & disease understanding to meet our partners' evolving needs: a comprehensive disease knowledge at the molecular level, cutting-edge technologies & platforms to translate this expertise into effective precision medicines. \n\n  * [Our Solutions](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-solutions)\n  * [Our Partners](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-partners)\n  * [Our Company](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-company)\n  * [Jobs & Careers](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-company/careers)\n  * [IR & News](https://www.evotec.com/en/ir-news)\n\n\n\n  * [Imprint](https://www.evotec.com/en/imprint)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.evotec.com/en/privacy-policy)\n  * [Legal Notice](https://www.evotec.com/en/legal-notice)\n  * [Terms & Conditions](https://www.evotec.com/en/terms-conditions)\n  * [RSS](https://www.evotec.com/en/corporate-news/rss)\n  * [Search](https://www.evotec.com/en/search)\n\n\n\n### Contact Us\n\ninfo@evotec.com\n\n+49 40 560 81 0\n\n[To Contact](/contact)\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * [![Evotec](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Social_Logos/linkedin.svg)Evotec](https://www.linkedin.com/company/evotec)\n  * [![Evotec](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Social_Logos/X-logo-black_RSZ.jpg)Evotec](https://twitter.com/Evotec)\n  * [![Cyprotex](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Social_Logos/linkedin.svg)Cyprotex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cyprotex/)\n  * [![Just - Evotec Biologics](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Social_Logos/linkedin.svg)Just - Evotec Biologics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/just-inc-/)\n\n\n\n[ ![Evotec Logo White](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Internal_Logos/_footerLogoBig/logo-evotec-white-footer.svg) ](/en) [ ![Logo cyprotex white footer](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Internal_Logos/_footerLogoBig/logo-cyprotex-white-footer.svg) ](/en/services/cyprotex-adme-tox-solutions) [ ![Logo justevotec biologics white footer](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Internal_Logos/_footerLogoBig/logo-justevotec-biologics-white-footer.svg) ](/en/services/just-evotec-biologics)\n\n©2024, All right reserved.\n"

However, any strategic moves to further push growth and strengthen the Company’s competitive position or increase critical mass via potential company or product acquisitions, equity investments or extended R&D efforts will need to be considered separately. Evotec intends to achieve significant organic capacity growth as a result of its corporate strategy. The Company continued to increase investments in the expansion and development of individual locations in 2023. In Toulouse, it has started to significantly expand its capacities and to build J.POD Toulouse, France. Moreover, it is expanding the existing campus in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK, and construction of the new building for the planned iPSC centre in Hamburg has progressed significantly. After the completion of the first J.POD facility in North America, the Company expects the completion of the second J.POD facility in Toulouse, France in 2024. The two J.POD facilities meet the production requirements of the coming years and strengthen Evotec's position as a leading partner for drug discovery and development with revolutionary technologies.\n\n##  You might be interested in... \n\n### [Stock Information ](https://www.evotec.com/en/investor-relations/stock-information)\n\n### [Financial Publications ](https://www.evotec.com/en/investor-relations/financial-publications)\n\n### [Sustainability ](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-company/sustainability)\n\n### [Annual General Meeting ](https://www.evotec.com/en/investor-relations/annual-general-meeting)\n\n## Contact Us\n\n![Volker Braun](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/authorImages/_contactImage/Volker_Braun_EDT_V2_RSZ.jpg)\n\n####  Investor Relations \n\ninvestorrelations@evotec.com\n\n[vCard](https://www.evotec.com/index.php?p=actions/vcard/default/index&vcard=k2L_d5GWkL1g7bx9OykNr2sy9555ftKZOHGJzgcW20rjg8i0TYOAyVLwiY19m1nHTJLQkGcnjbAiJZTe9eu638S52ZdeMkkZ1JpoaTlp-N2RV66t-x11l7jAV7O73rrsonXQTOYgP_NK7Feu5Drl1_B1PHAyd2GlIoWAynuLK8X4FgyzB1CN-oIr7oEXWyqFDEsTIZmUeDCF3WDpur7oaUnew3OCMSoCg23kEe30HSE)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.evotec.com/en/contact)\n\n![Logo Evotec white](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Internal_Logos/_contactCompanyLogo/RZ_Logo_Evotec_220829_RGB_white.png)\n\nEvotec has the right technologies & disease understanding to meet our partners' evolving needs: a comprehensive disease knowledge at the molecular level, cutting-edge technologies & platforms to translate this expertise into effective precision medicines. \n\n  * [Our Solutions](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-solutions)\n  * [Our Partners](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-partners)\n  * [Our Company](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-company)\n  * [Jobs & Careers](https://www.evotec.com/en/our-company/careers)\n  * [IR & News](https://www.evotec.com/en/ir-news)\n\n\n\n  * [Imprint](https://www.evotec.com/en/imprint)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.evotec.com/en/privacy-policy)\n  * [Legal Notice](https://www.evotec.com/en/legal-notice)\n  * [Terms & Conditions](https://www.evotec.com/en/terms-conditions)\n  * [RSS](https://www.evotec.com/en/corporate-news/rss)\n  * [Search](https://www.evotec.com/en/search)\n\n\n\n### Contact Us\n\ninfo@evotec.com\n\n+49 40 560 81 0\n\n[To Contact](/contact)\n\n### Follow Us\n\n  * [![Evotec](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Social_Logos/linkedin.svg)Evotec](https://www.linkedin.com/company/evotec)\n  * [![Evotec](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Social_Logos/X-logo-black_RSZ.jpg)Evotec](https://twitter.com/Evotec)\n  * [![Cyprotex](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Social_Logos/linkedin.svg)Cyprotex](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cyprotex/)\n  * [![Just - Evotec Biologics](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Social_Logos/linkedin.svg)Just - Evotec Biologics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/just-inc-/)\n\n\n\n[ ![Evotec Logo White](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Internal_Logos/_footerLogoBig/logo-evotec-white-footer.svg) ](/en) [ ![Logo cyprotex white footer](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Internal_Logos/_footerLogoBig/logo-cyprotex-white-footer.svg) ](/en/services/cyprotex-adme-tox-solutions) [ ![Logo justevotec biologics white footer](https://www.evotec.com/uploads/icons-logos/Logos/Internal_Logos/_footerLogoBig/logo-justevotec-biologics-white-footer.svg) ](/en/services/just-evotec-biologics)\n\n©2024, All right reserved.\n"
