(NASDAQ: AVO) (“Mission” or “the Company”) a world leader in sourcing, producing, and distributing fresh Hass avocados, today announced the implementation of a policy aimed at addressing illegal deforestation associated with avocado farming in Michoacán, Mexico.\n\n“Illegal deforestation in Michoacán, where a significant majority of Mexico’s overall avocado production is from, is an important issue to our Company and our stakeholders,” said John Pawlowski, President and Chief Operating Officer. “For that reason, we are taking action to promote environmental stewardship in this area. While we cannot solve the issue of illegal deforestation in this region alone, this policy demonstrates our commitment to be part of the solution and aims to set a positive precedent in the industry.”\n\nIn the policy, Mission Produce will prohibit its direct sourcing operations in Michoacán from sourcing avocados from the 279 orchards recently identified to be associated with illegal deforestation by the Ministry of Environment for the State of Michoacán. On a quarterly basis, the Company will review and assess any additional ranches identified by the Ministry of Environment for the State of Michoacán to be associated with illegal deforestation and continue to explore available resources and methodologies to identify additional actions it can implement to address this important issue.\n\nThe policy can be found on the Sustainability Page of the Company’s website at [www.missionproduce.com/sustainability](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wus_0GeqDI-ais9yg9g_ouaMBlOtkcaQXK5cpurnForJBa9cHajan3VNUz7sjPnVGdXtPTz7Ws5ZQpUQuWhCWaPMF_vihcOpYk7LsWCt3_Xj14o0s1JHjyCT7jzBaInHePg3MnIyUQMJ0cI-yij_cA==).\n\n**About Mission Produce, Inc.:**\n\nMission Produce is a global leader in the worldwide avocado business with additional offerings in mangos and blueberries.

(Nasdaq: AVO) (“Mission” or the “Company”), a world leader in sourcing, producing, and distributing fresh Hass avocados with additional offerings in mangos and blueberries, today provided a business and financial performance update for the fiscal fourth quarter ended October 31, 2024 ahead of its participation in upcoming investor events. The Company expects to release its fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2024 results, along with its forward assumptions related to the industry outlooks, in December.\n\n**CEO Message**\n\n“We expect to deliver strong fourth quarter top and bottom-line results that demonstrate continued momentum across our business and our team’s focus on driving improved results,” stated Steve Barnard, CEO of Mission. “We expect our Marketing & Distribution segment to deliver another strong performance, as our team effectively leveraged our global sourcing network amid a sustained higher pricing environment to achieve per-unit margins exceeding our targeted range. Looking ahead, we remain excited about our position and will continue to focus on operational excellence, strategic growth initiatives, and sound capital allocation to drive long-term shareholder value.”\n\n**Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Update**\n\nThe Company is providing the following update on financial performance for the fiscal fourth quarter 2024:\n\n  * Total revenue is expected to exceed $320 million compared to $257.9 million in the same period last year. This performance was driven primarily by the Marketing & Distribution segment, reflecting a continuation of the strong pricing environment on volumes consistent with prior expectations.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA is expected to exceed $28 million compared to $17.3 million in the same period last year, primarily driven by a continuation of the stronger per unit margin performance in the Marketing and Distribution segment that the Company has demonstrated this fiscal year.\n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nThis press release contains the non-GAAP financial measure “adjusted EBITDA.” Management believes this measure provides useful information for analyzing the underlying business results. The measure is not in accordance with, nor is it a substitute for or superior to, the comparable financial measure by generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA refers to net income (loss), before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, other income (expense), and income (loss) from equity method investees, further adjusted by asset impairment and disposals, net of insurance recoveries, farming costs for nonproductive orchards (which represents land lease costs), recognition of deferred ERP costs, transaction costs, amortization of inventory adjustments recognized from business combinations, and any special, non-recurring, or one-time items such as remeasurements or impairments, and any portion of these items attributable to the noncontrolling interest, all of which are excluded from the results the CEO reviews uses to assess segment performance and results.\n\n**About Mission Produce, Inc.**\n\nMission Produce is a global leader in the worldwide avocado business with additional offerings in mangos and blueberries. Since 1983, Mission Produce has been sourcing, producing and distributing fresh Hass avocados, and currently services retail, wholesale and foodservice customers in over 25 countries.
