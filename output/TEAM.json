          "content": "Shareholder letter\nQ1 FY25 | October 31, 2024\nFrom the CEO\nFellow shareholders,\nWe had a good start to our fiscal year, energized by our Team ’24 Europe event in Barcelona. I couldn’t\nbe prouder of all the innovation we’re shipping. Seeing the pure delight on our customers’ faces only\nincreases the fire in our bellies to get after the vast opportunities ahead.\nWe grew subscription revenue 33% year-over-year in Q1, as we continue to expand within our massive\nbase of over 300,000 customers. I’ve met with dozens of CEOs and CIOs at our largest customers over\nthe past few months and listened to the challenges they face. All are increasingly looking to technology\nas a way to drive their businesses forward and create a source of competitive differentiation. Across\nevery conversation, my biggest takeaway is their desire to partner more deeply with Atlassian in order\nto help their teams work better, together.\nWith technology becoming a more central part of every business, the challenge becomes how to\nfacilitate collaboration between technology and business teams across an organization. Digital\ntransformation and AI adoption aren’t just limited to technology teams; they impact every team. Our\nplatform spans software, IT, and business teams, making Atlassian uniquely positioned to bring these\nteams together through our differentiated System of Work.\nOur System of Work is a philosophy of how technology-driven\norganizations should work, connecting technology and business\nteams to accelerate progress and maximize team impact.\nQ1 FY25\n2\nWe have built a portfolio powered by the Atlassian cloud platform to help customers of any size, including\nthe largest, most complex enterprises, align work to goals, plan and track work, and unleash their\norganization’s collective knowledge. Today, roughly 50% of Jira users are from business teams, illustrating\nhow our portfolio of products can bring all types of teams together to solve complex problems.\nA T L A S S I A N + M O T A B I L I T Y O P E R A T I O N S\n“Atlassian accelerates our collaborative culture, instead of slowing people down. Through\nworking with tech teams, Marketing wants to use Jira. We love that teams can flex Jira\nhowever they need to, to improve their processes and speed.”\nLloyd Jones\nAgile and Engineering Practice Manager, Motability Operations\nAnd there’s so much more runway ahead. We are incredibly bullish on our System of Work and continue\nto innovate to bring this vision to our customers.\nThis, of course, includes AI, which is already playing a pivotal role in the way work gets done.\nAwe-inspiring AI Announcements\nEarlier this month at Team ’24 Europe, we launched our biggest advancements in AI to date. We’ve been\nable to ship incredible AI innovation into the hands of our customers quickly due to two major\ncompetitive differentiators:\n1. Our R&D engine means we build and ship fast. We aren’t just marketing AI; we’re delivering real\nfeatures and benefits that thousands of customers are using today. Atlassian Intelligence usage has\nincreased nearly 10x since the beginning of the calendar year.\n2. Our 20+ years of data makes for truly unique AI experiences. Our customers can access their first and\nthird-party data across how their teams plan and track work, set goals, and unleash knowledge in a\nlayer we call the “Teamwork Graph.” When a customer’s Teamwork Graph is paired with the power of\nAtlassian Intelligence, they truly realize what is possible.\nOur newest product, Rovo, is built on our unified cloud platform with the power of Atlassian Intelligence\nand enables teams to unlock organizational knowledge at scale. With Rovo, our customers can now\nhave thousands of specialized agents within their organization, help their teams find knowledge, learn\nfrom that knowledge, and, most importantly, act on that knowledge. We’re thrilled to share that in just\nfive months since its announcement, Rovo is now in General Availability for all customers.\nA T L A S S I A N + P R O C O R E\n“Rovo Search is helping our teams find information much faster, reduce cognitive load, and stay\nin the flow. It’s really promising so far. I don't foresee a future where we don't have it.”\nRonny Katzenberger\nDirector of Engineering Enablement, Procore\nQ1 FY25\n3\nRovo leverages the Teamwork Graph,\nmeaning it doesn’t just search across\nAtlassian products, it also pulls data\nfrom third-party connectors. Rovo will\nsoon have over 50 connectors across\nthe most popular SaaS applications.\nRovo agents come in three kinds: ‘Out-\nof-the-Box’, which Atlassian has built;\n‘Build Yourself’, which can be built by\nour customers through code or no\ncode options; and the ever-expanding\nnumber of Marketplace agents built\nby our Marketplace partners, and\nintegrate seamlessly across the\nAtlassian platform.\nA T L A S S I A N + O V O E N E R G Y\n“Rovo is a game changer. It has already transformed how our teams find and act on\ninformation.”\nLuke Collins\nSenior Solutions Engineer, OVO Energy\nWe’re also looking to solve developer pain points with AI-powered agents. We recently surveyed\nthousands of developers and engineering leaders and found that the majority of developers lose 8 hours\nor more each week due to workflow inefficiencies. To address this, we are introducing two new\ndeveloper-focused AI agents: Autodev and Autoreview.\nOur Autodev agent allows developers to use AI to generate code plans and recommendations, write\nsoftware, and generate pull requests, all based on the issue description —right within Jira.\nOur Autoreview agent allows development teams to automatically gain the skills of a senior,\nexperienced engineer. The agent reviews the code thoroughly and can give detailed feedback, explaining\nthe ‘why’ and providing the direct code changes the developer can accept or tweak before finalizing.\nFinally, for Jira Service Management’s over 55,000 (and growing!) customers, we’ve made key\nadvancements in AI-powered support. Forrester recently interviewed a set of Atlassian customers using\nJira Service Management’s Virtual Service Agents, and found that a composite organization based on\nthese customers was able to deflect 30% of all requests from its IT service desk, with end users also\nsaving 25 minutes per request1. We are extending Virtual Service Agents beyond Slack into Microsoft\nTeams and Jira Service Management Help Center so they can reply to emails as well as provide\nmultilingual support. And with the addition of Rovo for Ops agents, teams can dig deeper into incidents,\nidentify subject matter experts, and surface additional resources to fast track resolution.\n1- The Total Economic Impact™ of Jira Service Management, a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting, 2024. Results are for a composite organization based on interviewed customers.\nQ1 FY25\n4\n💥\nMore, more, more…from Team ’24 Europe\nOur R&D machine is delivering new innovation like never before. We’re shipping new products and\nupdates to help technology-driven organizations implement our System of Work.\nAs part of Atlassian’s increased focus on serving enterprises, we unveiled Atlassian Focus, a new\nproduct as part of our Enterprise Strategy and Planning solution for enterprise leaders.\nAtlassian Focus ensures people and resources are deployed across the right priorities, providing a\ncentral hub to map and track goals, work, teams, and funds against strategic priorities. Focus means\nleaders can get answers to questions like: ‘Do we have the right people working on the right things?’\n‘What are their goals and do those support our company’s top priorities?’ ‘Are we investing enough in\nthose priorities?’ Focus complements Jira Align’s enterprise planning capabilities by connecting\nstrategic priorities to structured goals, all work, supporting teams, and associated funds.\nAccording to Gartner®:\n“By 2025, 70% of digital investments will fail to deliver the expected business outcomes, due\nto the absence of a strategic portfolio management (SPM) approach.”2\nWe also announced Atlassian Home, a single place where employees can go for a personalized view of\ntheir work. Atlassian Home connects work across the Atlassian ecosystem with tailored views of Goals,\nTeams, Projects, and Tasks. Powered by the Teamwork Graph, it delivers personalized experiences based\non unified data from all Atlassian products.\nAnd as we deliver more advanced capabilities in higher-level editions of our products, we’re seeing great\nsuccess with customers climbing the ladder to Premium and Enterprise editions. So we’ve added even\nmore premium offerings to our portfolio:\nPREMIUM\nGuard Premium unlocks advanced security for customers to protect their Atlassian cloud data, such as\nmore granular data protection policies to block access and certain actions, new detection controls when\nconfidential content is added, and enhanced alert details to investigate suspicious details.\nPREMIUM\nJira Product Discovery Premium makes it even easier for organizations to build the right thing at scale\nvia increased visibility, control, and productivity. New AI capabilities further empower product teams to\ncapture and prioritize ideas and insights, ensuring alignment across technical and business teams to\nhelp bring new products and features to life.\nPREMIUM\nCompass Premium unlocks advanced capabilities to help engineering and platform leaders drive change\nand operate at scale across their engineering organizations. These features empower teams to manage\nthe growing complexity of software development, streamline collaboration, and enhance productivity\nfor software development teams.\n2- Gartner, Elevate Your Discussion to Drive Strategy Execution, Anthony Henderson, January 9, 2024.

This consistent reinvestment in product is key in driving sustained durable growth and\nstrong customer retention.\nIn Jira, we’re bringing new features (and a new look!) that make Jira easier, more flexible, and more\npowerful for all types of work, and all types of teams. There is now new customizable navigation, new\nproject templates, new AI features, and a completely redesigned UX.\nIn Confluence, we’re seeing customers consolidate their array of SaaS tools, making Confluence even\nmore central to their collaboration. One of the drivers of this consolidation is Confluence Whiteboards.\nWe’ve added amazing AI capabilities to Whiteboards, so users can generate sticky notes from ideas on\npages - or the reverse - summarize a Whiteboard onto a Confluence page. We’re stoked to share that\nConfluence has surpassed 100,000 customers. 🎉\nIn Loom, we’re rolling out a powerful new Confluence integration that allows teams to record and insert\nLoom videos directly into Confluence to explain thoughts, provide feedback, and add extra context to their\npages. We also welcomed Rewatch to the Atlassian family so customers can harness recording, calendar\nintegration, and AI-powered notetaking capabilities, all directly within Loom. Bug reports and documents\ncan be generated directly from Loom videos, empowering our customers to collaborate in richer, more\nhuman ways.\nPower in the Platform\nExperiences\nData Visualization Automation Atlassian Intelligence Search\nTeamwork\nGraph\nEnterprise\nPerformance Scale Reliability Compliance Privacy\nSecurity\nInfrastructure\nAtlassian Cloud Platform\nAtlassian’s powerful cloud platform makes all of this possible. We are constantly increasing scalability\nfor larger enterprises, with plans to support up to 150,000 users in Confluence going into General\nAvailability by the end of this calendar year and 100,000 users in Jira now on our public cloud roadmap.\nWe’re also working on adding more admin features, like Portfolio Insights which lets admins better\nunderstand their product footprint, and Command Line Interface to help our customers scale.\nAs a further commitment to expanding our compliance standards, Atlassian joined the EU AI Pact, and\nwe expect to achieve SOC 2 and ISO 27001 for Rovo by the end of the year.\nQ1 FY25\n6\nUltimately, our platform spans software, IT, and business teams, and we’re seeing this differentiation\nand long-term focus pay off. We believe Jira’s broad capabilities, from work management and issue\ntracking to change management and collaboration are why Atlassian has once again been named a\nLeader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for DevOps Platforms3.\nAtlassian was also named a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Enterprise Service Management, Q4 2023,\nwith Jira Service Management receiving the highest possible score in the strategy category. Separately,\na recent Forrester research report cited Atlassian as one of two IT management software vendors\nhaving reached dominant positions in the market:\n“IT management tools, referred to as the IT control plane, have been consolidating for years.\nA bipolar market is emerging, centering on ServiceNow and Atlassian, which have achieved\ncritical mass that competitors will find hard to match.”4\nStrengthening Executive Leadership\nAs part of continuing to seize the opportunities ahead, particularly in the enterprise, we are thrilled to\nannounce the appointment of Brian Duffy as Atlassian’s new Chief Revenue Officer. Brian’s experience in\nsales transformations is vast with nearly two decades in the technology industry. Brian spent 18 years at\nSAP, and in his role as President of Cloud, Brian launched, built, and scaled ‘RISE with SAP’, a strategic\ninitiative to move customers to the cloud. Through agility, focus, and innovative migration practices,\nBrian was able to grow RISE from an initiative to a multi-billion dollar business in the span of two years.\nBrian took that experience to his most recent role as CEO of SoftwareOne where he set the company up\nfor its next phase of growth and deepened relationships with customers and partners. Beyond the\nleadership Brian will bring in Sales and Customer Success, his public company CEO experience will bring\nunique depth and breadth to our amazing exec team.\nBrian will officially join us on January 1, 2025. We can’t wait to have him join the team.\nI’m pleased with the progress we’ve made in the first quarter of FY25 and continue to be optimistic\nabout the significant opportunities ahead. Our years of effort in building a world-class cloud platform\nare paying off, particularly in the AI era. Our System of Work philosophy is increasingly being adopted by\ntechnology-driven organizations, and our products continue to be the cornerstone for how millions of\nteams get work done.\nIt’s the unique combination of the Atlassian platform, our System of Work philosophy, our AI strategy\nand our portfolio of products that gives me confidence in our ability to achieve our mission of unleashing\nthe potential of every team.\n- Mike\nMike Cannon-Brookes\nCEO and Co-founder\n3- Gartner, Magic Quadrant for DevOps Platforms, Keith Mann, Thomas Murphy, Bill Holz, George Spafford, et al, 3 September 2024.\n4- Forrester. “Vendors Move to Dominate IT Management Software” Charles Betz, Julie Mohr. 11 July 2024.\nQ1 FY25\n7\nAsia Pacific\nEMEA\nAtlassian at-a-glance\n11%\n40%\n>500\nRevenue by\ncustomers\nGeography\n$67B\nwho spend $1M+\n>300K\nmarket opportunity\ncustomers\ngrowing 13%\nacross all industries\nAmericas\nannually\n49%\nThe three markets we serve\nSoftware development Work management\nService management\n$17B $15B $35B\nSAM SAM SAM\ngrowing 9% annually growing 14% annually\ngrowing 13% annually\n($6B ITSM + $9B non-ITSM)\nBy the numbers\nTechnical teams Business teams\n52% 48% 51% 49% 50% 50%\nUser User User\ndiversity diversity diversity\n>125K >55K >100K\nJira customers Jira Service Management customers Confluence customers\nLeader Leader\nNamed a in the Named a in The Forrester\nGartner Magic Quadrant™ for DevOps Platforms3 Wave™: Enterprise Service Management, Q4 2023\nNotes-\nUnless otherwise noted, financial, market, and customer data is as of or for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.\nThe user diversity breakdown by product is based on a sample of 5M+ Jira and Confluence Cloud users and 1M+ Jira Service Management users as of March 31, 2024.\n3- See footnote on page 7.\nQ1 FY25\n8\nJoe Binz\nChief Financial Officer\nFinancial highlights\n4(cid:46)ST(cid:56)(cid:1)R(cid:57)CS(cid:56)GS(cid:1)COF(cid:1)H(cid:46)TECM(cid:1))'),(cid:1)H(cid:46)OCOE(cid:46)CM(cid:1)T(cid:57)NNCS(cid:61)\nFirst quarter fiscal year 2025 financial summary (cid:1)\n(cid:5)U(cid:61)(cid:1)(cid:67)T(cid:62)a(cid:66)M(cid:61)P(cid:66)$(cid:1)QdOQ(cid:63)(cid:67)(cid:1)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)(cid:1)(cid:66)TM(cid:65)Q(cid:1)PM(cid:67)M(cid:1)M(cid:61)P(cid:1)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)OQ(cid:61)(cid:67)MSQ(cid:66)(cid:6)\n(U.S. $ in thousands, except percentages and per share data)\n(cid:35)(cid:45)SGG(cid:1)(cid:28)PO(cid:56)(cid:45)T(cid:1)3OFGF(cid:1)(cid:34)GQ(cid:56)GNDGS(cid:1)(cid:13)'$\n)')(cid:14) )')(cid:13)\n5//(cid:31)(cid:1)SGT(cid:57)M(cid:56)T\nFQbQ(cid:61)aQ (cid:2))$)0/$/0) (cid:2)1//$//-\n;(cid:65)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:1)(cid:63)(cid:65)(cid:62)RU(cid:67) (cid:2)1/($)-/ (cid:2)/11$/,.\n;(cid:65)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:1)YM(cid:65)SU(cid:61) .(cid:10)%- .(cid:10)%.\nC(cid:63)Q(cid:65)M(cid:67)U(cid:61)S(cid:1)(cid:59)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66) (cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:14))$1/0(cid:6) (cid:5)(cid:2))0$0.1(cid:6)\nC(cid:63)Q(cid:65)M(cid:67)U(cid:61)S(cid:1)YM(cid:65)SU(cid:61) (cid:4)(%- (cid:5) (cid:4)(cid:10)%(cid:18) (cid:5)\nBQ(cid:67)(cid:1)(cid:59)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66) (cid:5)(cid:2))(cid:13)(cid:14)$/.1(cid:6) (cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:14))$00(cid:14)(cid:6)\nBQ(cid:67)(cid:1)(cid:59)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:1)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)(cid:1)(cid:66)TM(cid:65)Q(cid:1)%(cid:1)PU(cid:59)a(cid:67)QP (cid:5)(cid:2)(&,0(cid:6) (cid:5)(cid:2)(&)(cid:13)(cid:6)\n7M(cid:66)T(cid:1)R(cid:59)(cid:62)c(cid:1)R(cid:65)(cid:62)Y(cid:1)(cid:62)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)M(cid:67)U(cid:62)(cid:61)(cid:66) (cid:2)0($,1(cid:13) (cid:2))..$1-.\n:PO%5//(cid:31)(cid:1)SGT(cid:57)M(cid:56)T\n;(cid:65)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:1)(cid:63)(cid:65)(cid:62)RU(cid:67) (cid:2)110$,0/ (cid:2)0(cid:13)(cid:13)$(cid:14)(cid:14)1\n;(cid:65)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:1)YM(cid:65)SU(cid:61) .(cid:13)%(cid:10) .(cid:13)%(cid:10)\nC(cid:63)Q(cid:65)M(cid:67)U(cid:61)S(cid:1)U(cid:61)O(cid:62)YQ (cid:2)(cid:13).0$(-( (cid:2)(cid:13)(cid:13),$1,(cid:14)\nC(cid:63)Q(cid:65)M(cid:67)U(cid:61)S(cid:1)YM(cid:65)SU(cid:61) ((%, ()%(cid:9)\nBQ(cid:67)(cid:1)U(cid:61)O(cid:62)YQ (cid:2))11$/(( (cid:2)).0$10(\nBQ(cid:67)(cid:1)U(cid:61)O(cid:62)YQ(cid:1)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)(cid:1)(cid:66)TM(cid:65)Q(cid:1)%(cid:1)PU(cid:59)a(cid:67)QP(cid:1) (cid:2)(&// (cid:2)(&.-\n:(cid:65)QQ(cid:1)OM(cid:66)T(cid:1)R(cid:59)(cid:62)c (cid:2)/,$(cid:14),) (cid:2)).(cid:14)$(cid:13)0/\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided within the tables at the end of this letter, in our\nearnings press release, and on our Investor Relations website.\nFirst quarter fiscal year 2025 highlights\nContinued enterprise momentum and steady sales execution drove a solid start to our fiscal year with\nrevenue, gross profit, and operating income exceeding our expectations. Revenue growth was primarily\ndriven by paid seat expansion, higher average revenue per user (ARPU), and migrations. Gross profit and\noperating income benefitted from revenue outperformance and our continued focus on disciplined cost\nmanagement. Overall, we delivered healthy financial results in Q1’25 despite the challenging year-over-\nyear comparison created by Server end-of-support (EoS) dynamics in FY24.\nOur product and engineering teams continue to deliver incredible innovation and customer value\nthrough the power of our enterprise-grade cloud platform, rapid advancements in AI, and the Atlassian\nSystem of Work. Enterprise customers are increasingly looking to Atlassian as a strategic partner to help\ntheir business and technology teams plan and track work, align on goals, and share knowledge across\ntheir organization.

Non-GAAP operating income was $268 million, and non-GAAP operating\nmargin of 23% was flat.\nOperating cash flow of $80 million decreased 52%, driven by higher annual employee bonus\n•\npayouts, partially offset by stronger collections. Free cash flow of $74 million decreased 54%.\nLastly, we are pleased to announce a new share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion that will\ncommence upon the completion of our existing $1.0 billion program. The new program, which has\nno expiration date, further underscores our confidence in our business, conviction in our significant\nlong-term opportunities, and view that our shares are undervalued. Our demonstrated ability to\ngenerate consistent free cash flow allows us to opportunistically return capital to stockholders\nwhile continuing to invest to drive durable long-term growth.\nRevenue\n-AI(cid:45)(cid:46)(cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:47)(cid:28)I(cid:46)(cid:32)I(cid:1)F(cid:33)(cid:1)(cid:33)A(cid:45)(cid:30)(cid:28)C(cid:1)%(cid:6)%(cid:11)(cid:1)I(cid:32)M(cid:32)E(cid:47)(cid:32)(cid:1)I(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:47)C(cid:46)(cid:45)\n(cid:4)(cid:43)L(cid:1)(cid:52)GMRP(cid:35)LCP$(cid:1)D(cid:56)(cid:37)DN(cid:52)(cid:1)NDO(cid:37)DL(cid:52)(cid:35)FD(cid:5)\n(U.S. $ in thousands, except percentage data)\n(cid:27)(cid:32)(cid:28)I(cid:5)FM(cid:32)I(cid:5)P(cid:32)(cid:28)I(cid:1)\nQ 4(cid:7) %(cid:11) 4(cid:7) %' (cid:34)IFN(cid:46)(cid:35)(cid:1)(cid:2)\n5(cid:32)M(cid:32)E(cid:47)(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:29)P(cid:1)(cid:46)PG(cid:32)\n(cid:33)RAP(cid:37)O(cid:43)N(cid:52)(cid:43)ML (cid:2)(cid:1) ($(*($0(cid:14)(cid:18)(cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:1) (cid:18),($0(cid:18))(cid:1) (cid:1)**(cid:1)\n(cid:30)(cid:52)GDO(cid:6) (cid:1) ,,$(cid:18)**(cid:1) (cid:1) (),$.0*(cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:4),-(cid:5)(cid:1)\n(cid:34)M(cid:52)(cid:35)(cid:45)(cid:1)ODSDLRDP (cid:2)(cid:1) ($((cid:18).$.(cid:18)((cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:1) 0..$..,(cid:1) (cid:1))((cid:1)\n(cid:5).19(cid:31)(cid:36)5(cid:31)1(cid:31)35(cid:1)(cid:34)5(cid:38)5(cid:31)(cid:37)5(cid:1)(cid:34)5(cid:29)1(cid:36)54(cid:1)(cid:36)(cid:32)(cid:1)(cid:32)(cid:37)(cid:34)(cid:1)05(cid:34)(cid:38)5(cid:34)(cid:1)(cid:32)665(cid:34)9(cid:31)7(cid:35)(cid:1)81(cid:35)(cid:1)255(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:34)53(cid:29)1(cid:35)(cid:35)96954(cid:1)(cid:36)(cid:32)(cid:1)(cid:18)(cid:36)85(cid:34)(cid:1)(cid:34)5(cid:38)5(cid:31)(cid:37)5(cid:35)(cid:1)9(cid:31)(cid:1)(cid:36)85(cid:1)3(cid:32)(cid:30)(cid:33)1(cid:34)1(cid:36)9(cid:38)5(cid:1)(cid:33)5(cid:34)9(cid:32)4(cid:6)\n(cid:27)(cid:32)(cid:28)I(cid:5)FM(cid:32)I(cid:5)P(cid:32)(cid:28)I(cid:1)\n4(cid:7) %(cid:11) 4(cid:7) %' (cid:34)IFN(cid:46)(cid:35)(cid:1)(cid:2)\n5(cid:32)M(cid:32)E(cid:47)(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:29)P(cid:1)(cid:31)(cid:32)GCFPD(cid:32)E(cid:46)\n3(cid:45)MRC (cid:2)(cid:1) .0)$*(cid:10)-(cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:1) -(cid:10)(cid:14)$-(cid:14).(cid:1) (cid:1)*((cid:1)\n4(cid:35)(cid:52)(cid:35)(cid:1)3DL(cid:52)DO (cid:1) **,$,0(cid:14)(cid:1) (cid:1) )(cid:14))$0(cid:14)*(cid:1) (cid:1)*(cid:18)(cid:1)\n(cid:33)DOSDO (cid:1) (cid:59)(cid:1) (cid:1) .(cid:18)$.,)(cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:4)((cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:5)(cid:1)\n9(cid:35)O(cid:44)D(cid:52)N(cid:45)(cid:35)(cid:37)D(cid:1)(cid:35)LC(cid:1)M(cid:52)GDO (cid:1) ,0$(cid:18)(cid:18)((cid:1) (cid:1) ,($(cid:14)**(cid:1) (cid:1)(-(cid:1)\n(cid:34)M(cid:52)(cid:35)(cid:45)(cid:1)ODSDLRDP (cid:2)(cid:1) ($((cid:18).$.(cid:18)((cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:1) 0..$..,(cid:1) (cid:1))((cid:1)\n(cid:27)(cid:32)(cid:28)I(cid:5)FM(cid:32)I(cid:5)P(cid:32)(cid:28)I(cid:1)\n4(cid:7) %(cid:11) 4(cid:7) %' (cid:34)IFN(cid:46)(cid:35)(cid:1)(cid:2)\n5(cid:32)M(cid:32)E(cid:47)(cid:32)(cid:45)(cid:1)(cid:29)P(cid:1)(cid:34)(cid:32)F(cid:34)I(cid:28)G(cid:35)A(cid:30)(cid:1)I(cid:32)(cid:34)AFE\n2(cid:46)DO(cid:43)(cid:37)(cid:35)P (cid:2)(cid:1) ,(cid:18)(cid:14)$(cid:14)00(cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:1) (cid:14)(cid:18)0$,)(cid:18)(cid:1) (cid:1)(0(cid:1)\n5952 (cid:1) (cid:14)-0$)-0(cid:1) (cid:1) *.(cid:18)$(cid:10)(cid:10)-(cid:1) (cid:1))(cid:14)(cid:1)\n2P(cid:43)(cid:35)(cid:1)(cid:31)(cid:35)(cid:37)(cid:43)E(cid:43)(cid:37) (cid:1) (*(cid:14)$(cid:10)(*(cid:1) (cid:1) (((cid:10)$)(cid:14)((cid:1) (cid:1)))(cid:1)\n(cid:34)M(cid:52)(cid:35)(cid:45)(cid:1)ODSDLRDP (cid:2)(cid:1) ($((cid:18).$.(cid:18)((cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:1) 0..$..,(cid:1) (cid:1))((cid:1)\nQ1 FY25\n10\n(cid:7)\nRevenues by deployment\n(U.S. $ in millions, except percentage data)\n$1,189 $1,188\n$1,132\nServer\n$30\n$60\n$1,060\nMarketplace and other\n(1)\n$92\n$67\nData Center $978\n$939\n$69\nCloud\n$63 $336\n$79\n$327\n$86\n$364\n$51\n$58\n$275\n$243\n$232\n$792\n$738\n$703\n$653\n$605\n$563\nNote: revenue totals may\nnot foot due to rounding\nQ4’23 Q1’24 Q2’24 Q3’24 Q4’24 Q1’25\nYear-over-year growth % Q4’23 Q1’24 Q2’24 Q3’24 Q4’24 Q1’25\nCloud 30% 27% 27% 31% 31% 31%\nData Center 46% 42% 41% 64% 41% 38%\nMarketplace and other 17% 9% 5% 43% 16% 16%\nServer (27%) (31%) (35%) (69%) (100%) (100%)\nTotal revenues 24% 21% 21% 30% 20% 21%\nIncluded in Marketplace and other is premier support revenue.

Premier support is recognized\nas subscription revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as the services are\ndelivered over the term of the arrangement.\nRevenue growth in Q1 was driven by subscription revenue, which grew 33%.\nCloud revenue growth of 31% was driven by paid seat expansion in existing customers, migrations, and\ncross-sell of additional products such as Jira Service Management and Guard, as well as encouraging\ntraction with emerging products like Loom and Jira Product Discovery. Overall, trends in the quarter were\nconsistent with the prior quarter as paid seat expansion in existing customers and migrations exceeded\nour expectations, while cross-sell of additional products, adoption of higher-value editions, top-of-funnel\nperformance, and customer retention performed in line to slightly ahead of our expectations.\nQ1 FY25\n11\nData Center revenue growth of 38% was driven by prior-year Server migrations, price increases, and\nseat expansion in existing customers, partially offset by continued migrations to Cloud. Renewal rates,\nrealized price increases, and seat expansion were slightly ahead of our expectations, highlighting the\nmission-critical nature of our products.\nMarketplace and other revenue growth of 16% was driven by continued momentum in third-party app\npurchasing related to the Cloud and Data Center billings in the quarter.\nLastly, deferred revenue increased 34% year-over-year to $2.0 billion driven by continued customer\ncommitment to the Atlassian platform.\nMargins, operating expenses, and operating income (loss)\n4(cid:46)ST(cid:56)(cid:1)R(cid:57)CS(cid:56)GS(cid:1)PH(cid:1)H(cid:46)TECM(cid:1))'),(cid:1)NCSI(cid:46)OT(cid:1)COF(cid:1)PQGSC(cid:56)(cid:46)OI(cid:1)GYQGOTG(cid:1)T(cid:57)NNCS(cid:61)\n(cid:1)\n(U.S. $ in thousands, except percentage data)\n(cid:5)U(cid:61)(cid:1)(cid:67)T(cid:62)a(cid:66)M(cid:61)P(cid:66)$(cid:1)QdOQ(cid:63)(cid:67)(cid:1)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)(cid:1)(cid:66)TM(cid:65)Q(cid:1)PM(cid:67)M(cid:1)M(cid:61)P(cid:1)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)OQ(cid:61)(cid:67)MSQ(cid:6)\n(cid:62) (cid:32)((cid:4)), (cid:32)((cid:4))(cid:14)\n5SPTT(cid:1)NCSI(cid:46)O\ng g\n;55D(cid:1)S(cid:65)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:1)YM(cid:65)SU(cid:61) .(cid:10)%- .(cid:10)%.\nB(cid:62)(cid:61)%;55D(cid:1)S(cid:65)(cid:62)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:1)YM(cid:65)SU(cid:61) .(cid:13)%(cid:10) .(cid:13)%(cid:10)\n(cid:35)P(cid:56)CM(cid:1)PQGSC(cid:56)(cid:46)OI(cid:1)GYQGOTGT\n;55D(cid:1)(cid:62)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)M(cid:67)U(cid:61)S(cid:1)Qd(cid:63)Q(cid:61)(cid:66)Q(cid:66) (cid:2))$(((cid:13)$)(cid:14)- (cid:2)0)0$.)-\nB(cid:62)(cid:61)%;55D(cid:1)(cid:62)(cid:63)Q(cid:65)M(cid:67)U(cid:61)S(cid:1)Qd(cid:63)Q(cid:61)(cid:66)Q(cid:66) (cid:2)/(cid:14)($,(cid:14)/ (cid:2)-1/$(cid:14)1.\n>GTGCSE(cid:45)(cid:1)COF(cid:1)FGWGMPQNGO(cid:56)(cid:1)GYQGOTGT\n;55D(cid:1)(cid:65)Q(cid:66)QM(cid:65)OT(cid:1)M(cid:61)P(cid:1)PQbQ(cid:59)(cid:62)(cid:63)YQ(cid:61)(cid:67)(cid:1)Qd(cid:63)Q(cid:61)(cid:66)Q(cid:66) (cid:2).((cid:14)$)() (cid:2),0)$/(cid:14)0\nB(cid:62)(cid:61)%;55D(cid:1)(cid:65)Q(cid:66)QM(cid:65)OT(cid:1)M(cid:61)P(cid:1)PQbQ(cid:59)(cid:62)(cid:63)YQ(cid:61)(cid:67)(cid:1)Qd(cid:63)Q(cid:61)(cid:66)Q(cid:66) (cid:2),(1$-.(cid:13) (cid:2)(cid:14)(cid:14))$)10\n(cid:1)(cid:39)(cid:32)(cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:39)(cid:43)8A(cid:1)F(cid:31)(cid:45)(cid:31)C(cid:44)(cid:31)G )(cid:13)%(cid:14) ))%(cid:18)\n(cid:28)CSLG(cid:56)(cid:46)OI(cid:1)COF(cid:1)TCMGT(cid:1)GYQGOTGT\n;55D(cid:1)YM(cid:65)WQ(cid:67)U(cid:61)S(cid:1)M(cid:61)P(cid:1)(cid:66)M(cid:59)Q(cid:66)(cid:1)Qd(cid:63)Q(cid:61)(cid:66)Q(cid:66) (cid:2)(cid:13)-(cid:13)$(cid:14)1(cid:14) (cid:2))1(cid:14)$-./\nB(cid:62)(cid:61)%;55D(cid:1)YM(cid:65)WQ(cid:67)U(cid:61)S(cid:1)M(cid:61)P(cid:1)(cid:66)M(cid:59)Q(cid:66)(cid:1)Qd(cid:63)Q(cid:61)(cid:66)Q(cid:66) (cid:2)(cid:13))(cid:13)$/(cid:13)1 (cid:2))-0$1(cid:13))\n(cid:1)(cid:39)(cid:32)(cid:1)(cid:43)(cid:39)(cid:43)8A(cid:1)F(cid:31)(cid:45)(cid:31)C(cid:44)(cid:31)G (cid:10)-%(cid:18) (cid:10),%)\n5GOGSCM(cid:1)COF(cid:1)CFN(cid:46)O(cid:46)T(cid:56)SC(cid:56)(cid:46)WG(cid:1)GYQGOTGT\n;55D(cid:1)SQ(cid:61)Q(cid:65)M(cid:59)(cid:1)M(cid:61)P(cid:1)MPYU(cid:61)U(cid:66)(cid:67)(cid:65)M(cid:67)UbQ(cid:1)Qd(cid:63)Q(cid:61)(cid:66)Q(cid:66) (cid:2)),.$.,) (cid:2)),(cid:14)$(cid:14))(\nB(cid:62)(cid:61)%;55D(cid:1)SQ(cid:61)Q(cid:65)M(cid:59)(cid:1)M(cid:61)P(cid:1)MPYU(cid:61)U(cid:66)(cid:67)(cid:65)M(cid:67)UbQ(cid:1)Qd(cid:63)Q(cid:61)(cid:66)Q(cid:66) (cid:2))(0$),.

free cash flow results experience quarterly seasonality, with Q1 typically having the\nlowest free cash flow of the year due to annual employee bonus payments in the quarter. The increase\nin bonus payment from the prior year was driven by higher attainment relative to target and a year-\nover-year increase in headcount.\nCustomers with >$10,000 in Cloud ARR\nWe ended Q1’25 with 46,844 customers with greater than $10,000 in Cloud annualized recurring\nrevenue (“Cloud ARR”), an increase of 17% year-over-year. We continue to add enterprise-grade\ncapabilities and new product innovation on the cloud platform with the General Availability of Rovo, Jira\nProduct Discovery Premium, Compass Premium, and Guard Premium. This all comes on the heels of\nachieving FedRAMP® “In-Process” designation just a few months ago.

We define Cloud ARR as\nthe annualized recurring revenue run-rate of Cloud subscription agreements at a point in time. We calculate Cloud ARR by taking the\nCloud monthly recurring revenue (“Cloud MRR”) run-rate and multiplying it by 12. Cloud MRR for each month is calculated by\naggregating monthly recurring revenue from committed contractual amounts at a point in time. Cloud ARR and Cloud MRR should be\nviewed independently of revenue and do not represent our revenue under GAAP, as they are operational metrics that can be affected\nby contract start and end dates

Outlook\nT O TA L R E V E N U E\nWe expect total company revenue growth to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.0% in FY25. We continue to\ntake what we believe is an appropriately prudent and risk-adjusted approach in setting the outlook for\nour business based on two primary factors.\nFirst, given continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, our guidance contemplates\nmacro-related factors that would negatively impact revenue growth drivers such as paid seat\nexpansion, cross-sell of additional products, upsell to higher-value editions of our products, and\n(cid:9)\ncustomer retention.\n(cid:9)\nSecond, while we continue to make progress in serving the enterprise and are excited to welcome Brian\nDuffy as our new Chief Revenue Officer in January 2025, our outlook continues to allow for execution\nrisk in the ongoing evolution of our enterprise go-to-market motion.\nAdditionally, as a reminder, we will be lapping the impacts of Server EoS that benefited revenue in FY24.\nThese dynamics create challenging year-on-year comparisons in FY25 in three primary areas:\n•\nEvent-driven Data Center and Marketplace outperformance in Q3’24\n•\nRoll-off of FY24 Server migration benefits in both Data Center and Cloud\n•\nCessation of Server maintenance revenue\nQ1 FY25\n14\nFurther detail and commentary are provided below:\nCloud revenue\nWe have increased our Cloud revenue growth outlook to approximately 24.0% year-over-year in FY25.\nWe continue to assume migrations will drive a mid-single-digit revenue growth contribution. While we\nare encouraged by our performance in Q1’25, we are maintaining a risk-adjusted outlook due to the\nfactors described above.\nAs we deepen our relationships with our largest and most complex Data Center customers, they\ncontinue to express their strong desire to migrate to the Cloud and take advantage of the differentiated\nvalue of the Atlassian cloud platform through capabilities like automation, analytics, and AI. We expect\nthis cohort of customers to migrate over a multi-year period and increasingly adopt hybrid deployment\nstrategies.\nIn terms of seasonality, we expect Cloud revenue growth rates will decelerate in the second half of the\nyear as we lap the impact of the Loom acquisition, with Q3 facing the most challenging year-over-year\ncomparison due to Server EoS-related migrations in the prior year.\nData Center revenue\nWe expect Data Center revenue growth of approximately 20.5% year-over-year in FY25 driven by pricing,\nseat expansion in existing customers, and cross-sell of additional products. We expect growth to\ndecelerate in the second half of the year as we lap the event-driven purchasing from Server EoS in Q3\nand drive increasing migrations to the Cloud.\nMarketplace and other revenue\nWe expect Marketplace and other revenue growth of approximately 5.0% year-over-year in FY25. The\ndeceleration in the growth rate from FY24 is driven primarily by the challenging year-over-year\ncomparison related to the event-driven purchasing from Server EoS, as well as continued sales mix shift\nto Cloud apps.\nAs a reminder, there is currently a lower Marketplace take rate on third-party Cloud apps relative to Data\nCenter apps to further incentivize cloud app development.\nWe continue to expect Marketplace revenue growth to reaccelerate in FY26 as we lap the impact of\nServer EoS and continue to focus on driving strong third-party Cloud app attach to our first-party Cloud\nsolutions.\nG R O S S M A R G I N\nWe expect GAAP gross margin to be approximately 81.0% and non-GAAP gross margin to be\napproximately 83.5% in FY25, a decrease from the prior year driven by continued revenue mix shift to\nCloud.\nQ1 FY25\n15\nO P E R A T I N G M A R G I N\nWe expect GAAP operating margin to be in the range of (5.5%) to (5.0%) and non-GAAP operating margin\nto be in the range of 22.0% to 22.5% in FY25. Operating expense growth will be driven by our continued\ninvestments in R&D and sales and marketing to support our strategic priorities of enterprise, AI, and\ndelivering innovation across the product portfolio, partially offset by continued efficiency gains in G&A\nas we scale. And as a reminder, operating margin in FY24 benefitted by 2 percentage points from the\nevent-driven revenue outperformance related to Server EoS in Q3.\nWe remain confident in our ability to expand operating margin over time and are committed to\ndelivering non-GAAP operating margin of 25%+ by FY27 driven by durable revenue growth and a\ncontinued focus on driving operating efficiencies across the business.\nS H A R E C O U N T\nWe continue to expect diluted share count to increase by 1 to 2% in FY25.\nQ1 FY25\n16\nAT L A S S I A N C O R P O R AT I O

contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which statements\ninvolve substantial risks and uncertainties. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,”\n“expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “estimate,” or “continue,” and similar expressions or variations, but these words are\nnot the exclusive means for identifying such statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward-\nlooking, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties related to statements about our platform, products (including AI products),\nproduct features (including AI capabilities), customers, Atlassian Marketplace, Cloud and Data Center migrations, macroeconomic\nenvironment, anticipated growth, market potential, business plans, outlook, technology, leadership transitions, enterprise sales, and other\nkey strategic areas, and our financial targets such as total revenue, Cloud, Data Center, and Marketplace and other revenue and GAAP and\nnon-GAAP financial measures including gross margin, operating margin, and share count.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this shareholder letter to reflect events or circumstances\nafter the date of this shareholder letter or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nThe achievement or success of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties\nand assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially\nfrom the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as\npredictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such\nstatements are made.\nFurther information on that could affect our financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) from time to time, including the section titled “Risk Factors” in our most recently filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q. These documents are\navailable on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations section of our website at: https://investors.atlassian.com.\nA B O U T N O N - G A A P F I N A N C I A L M E A S U R E S\nIn addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we regularly review other measures that are not\npresented in accordance with GAAP, defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC, to evaluate our business, measure our performance,\nidentify trends, prepare financial forecasts and make strategic decisions. The key measures we consider are non-GAAP gross profit and non-\nGAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted\nshare and free cash flow (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”). These Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which may be different from\nsimilarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance on a\nnon-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges of a non-cash nature or that occur relatively infrequently and/or that\nmanagement considers to be unrelated to our core operations. Management believes that tracking and presenting these Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures provides management, our board of directors, investors and the analyst community with the ability to better evaluate matters\nsuch as: our ongoing core operations, including comparisons between periods and against other companies in our industry; our ability to\ngenerate cash to service our debt and fund our operations; and the underlying business trends that are affecting our performance.\nOur Non-GAAP Financial Measures include:\n• Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP gross margin. Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation, and amortization of\nacquired intangible assets.\n• Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation, and amortization\nof acquired intangible assets.\n• Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization\nof acquired intangible assets, gain on a non-cash sale of a controlling interest of a subsidiary, and the related income tax adjustments.\n• Free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which consists of purchases\nof property and equipment.\nWe understand that although these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are frequently used by investors and the analyst community in their\nevaluation of our financial performance, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation\nor as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We compensate for such limitations by reconciling these Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to review the tables in this shareholder letter titled\n“Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results” and “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Targets” that present such reconciliations.\nA B O U T AT L A S S I A N\nAtlassian unleashes the potential of every team.

In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,” “estimate,” or “continue,” and similar expressions or variations, but these words are not the exclusive means for identifying such statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward looking, including but not limited to risks and uncertainties related to statements about our platform, products (including AI products), product features (including AI capabilities), customers, enterprise sales, strategy, leadership transitions, macroeconomic environment, anticipated growth, outlook, technology, and other key strategic areas, and our financial targets such as total revenue, Cloud, Data Center, and Marketplace and other revenue, and GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures including gross margin and operating margin. \n\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. \n\nThe achievement or success of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made. \n\nFurther information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) from time to time, including the section titled “Risk Factors” in our most recently filed Forms 10-K and 10-Q. These documents are available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations section of our website at [https://investors.atlassian.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&esheet=54145632&newsitemid=20241031337458&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&index=8&md5=e08deedef75df0c519a1167736450992). \n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we regularly review other measures that are not presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends, prepare financial forecasts and make strategic decisions. The key measures we consider are non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and free cash flow (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures”). These Non-GAAP Financial Measures, which may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies, provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance on a non-GAAP basis that excludes certain gains, losses and charges of a non-cash nature or that occur relatively infrequently and/or that management considers to be unrelated to our core operations. Management believes that tracking and presenting these Non-GAAP Financial Measures provides management, our board of directors, investors and the analyst community with the ability to better evaluate matters such as: our ongoing core operations, including comparisons between periods and against other companies in our industry; our ability to generate cash to service our debt and fund our operations; and the underlying business trends that are affecting our performance. \n\nOur Non-GAAP Financial Measures include: \n\n  * _Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross margin_ . Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. \n  * _Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin_ . Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets. \n  * _Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share_ . Excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain on a non-cash sale of a controlling interest of a subsidiary and the related income tax adjustments. \n  * _Free cash flow_ . Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which consists of purchases of property and equipment. \n\n\n\nWe understand that although these Non-GAAP Financial Measures are frequently used by investors and the analyst community in their evaluation of our financial performance, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We compensate for such limitations by reconciling these Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to review the tables in this press release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results” and “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Targets” that present such reconciliations. \n\n**Customers with >$10,000 in Cloud ARR**\n\nWe define the number of customers with Cloud ARR greater than $10,000 at the end of any particular period as the number of organizations with unique domains with an active Cloud subscription for two or more seats and greater than $10,000 in Cloud ARR. \n\nWe define Cloud ARR as the annualized recurring revenue run-rate of Cloud subscription agreements at a point in time. We calculate Cloud ARR by taking the Cloud monthly recurring revenue (“Cloud MRR”) run-rate and multiplying it by 12. Cloud MRR for each month is calculated by aggregating monthly recurring revenue from committed contractual amounts at a point in time. Cloud ARR and Cloud MRR should be viewed independently of revenue and do not represent our revenue under GAAP, as they are operational metrics that can be affected by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. \n\n________________________ \n\n1 Gartner, Magic Quadrant for DevOps Platforms, Keith Mann, Thomas Murphy, Bill Holz, George Spafford, et al, 3 September 2024.

In projecting this long-term non-GAAP tax rate, we utilized a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct and indirect income tax effects of the other non-GAAP adjustments reflected above. Additionally, we considered our current operating structure and other factors such as our existing tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where we operate. For fiscal year 2025, we determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 26%. This fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate eliminates the effects of non-recurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Examples of the non-recurring and period specific items include but are not limited to changes in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets, effects resulting from acquisitions, and unusual or infrequently occurring items. We will periodically re-evaluate this long-term rate, as necessary, for significant events. The rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, for example, significant changes in the geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions where we operate.   \n---  \n(2) The effects of these dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted net loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.   \n  \n**Atlassian Corporation** **Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Targets**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ending** **December 31, 2024**  \n**GAAP gross margin** |  **81.0** |  **%**  \nPlus: Stock-based compensation  |  2.0   \nPlus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets  |  1.0   \n**Non-GAAP gross margin** |  **84.0** |  **%**  \n**GAAP operating margin** |  **(10.0** |  **%)**  \nPlus: Stock-based compensation  |  30.0   \nPlus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets  |  1.0   \n**Non-GAAP operating margin** |  **21.0** |  **%**  \n  \n**Fiscal Year Ending** **June 30, 2025**  \n---  \n**GAAP gross margin** |  **81.0** |  **%**  \nPlus: Stock-based compensation  |  1.5   \nPlus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets  |  1.0   \n**Non-GAAP gross margin** |  **83.5** |  **%**  \n**GAAP operating margin** |  **(5.5%) to (5.0%)**  \nPlus: Stock-based compensation  |  26.5   \nPlus: Amortization of acquired intangible assets  |  1.0   \n**Non-GAAP operating margin** |  **22.0% to 22.5%**  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241031337458r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact** Martin Lam IR@atlassian.com  **Media Contact** Marie-Claire Maple press@atlassian.com\n\nSource: Atlassian Corporation\n\n[ View all news ](/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Stay in touch with our email alerts\n\nTo receive notifications via email, enter your email address and select at least one subscription below.

We evaluated the locations of our offices,\nemployees, suppliers, and third-party data centers that Atlassian uses. The analysis was performed using the\nclimate datasets aligned with the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC), the international body responsible for assessing the latest science related to climate change,\nand the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. Using this methodology, we evaluated the following\neight physical hazards:\n· Coastal flooding\n· Cyclones\nSTRATEGY\n· Drought\nDisclose the actual and potential\n· Extreme heat\nimpacts of climate-related risks\nand opportunities on the company’s · Pluvial flooding\nbusinesses, strategy, and financial\n· Riverine flooding\nplanning.\n· Water stress\n· Wildfire\nThese potential hazards were modeled across three climate scenarios for the years 2030 (medium-term)\nand 2050 (long-term):\n· SSP1-2.6 (below 2°C): This scenario depicts a low warming world, a “best-case” scenario under which climate\nimpacts would be low\n· SSP2-4.5 (2°C-4°C): This scenario depicts a medium warming scenario, a “middle-of-the-road” scenario under\nwhich warming is limited but impacts emerge\n· SSP5-8.5 (above 4°C): This scenario depicts a high warming scenario, a “worst-case” scenario under which\nwarming is high and therefore climate impacts are high\nxii\nIntroduction Planet People Customers Community Governance Appendix Atlassian | FY2024 Sustainability Report\nAPPENDIX\nASSESSING CLIMATE RISK | Task force on climate-related disclosures (TCFD)\nPlanet\nTCFD RECOMMENDATION RESPONSE\nClimate models are inherently complex and uncertain, and while they can provide a general indication of plausible\nfuture outcomes, they do not serve as a forecast for future outcomes. Each scenario contains assumptions about\nthe level of climate change mitigation achieved, represented by the level of atmospheric GHG concentrations in\nthe year 2100. These assumptions are reflective of those developed in the Representative Concentration Pathways\n(RCPs) adopted by the IPCC, which help quantify different trajectories of future greenhouse gas concentrations and\nresulting average temperatures due to increases in climate change pollution. The selected scenarios provide a range\nof plausible future climate outcomes in order to help evaluate the range of potential impacts on our business.*\nSTRATEGY (cont.)

This was done by conducting research on climate risk regulations, their\napplicability to Atlassian, and the potential costs of non-compliance. In addition, we conducted a qualitative\nassessment to explore the key climate-related reputational risks for Atlassian, which included greenwashing,\nmissing sustainability commitments and targets, and regulatory compliance.\nThe following list outlines the most impactful climate-related physical and transition risks we identified based\non our ERM criteria and their possible impacts on our business operations.**\n*We leveraged findings from this scenario analysis for the years 2030 and 2050 to gain an indication of the potential magnitude of impact faced at each location by each hazard. Then, we translated modeling\nresults into normalized values (damage factors) representing the magnitude of impact at each location for each time horizon and scenario. We also integrated assumptions for vulnerability, adaptation, and\nmaximum damage potential into the analysis for consideration of physical risk exposure. Vulnerability, adaptation, and maximum damage assumptions were developed based on the risk (e.g., impacts on our\noffices, impacts on employees, etc.).

The Sustainability team reviews current and emerging climate risks annually, and will continue to collaborate\nwith a third party for a comprehensive review every 2-5 years to guide decision-making. The Sustainability team\nthen engages with risk owners to gather insights that help qualitatively assess the risk level based on ERM\ncriteria and ongoing mitigation strategies.\n2. Subsequently, the Sustainability team quantitatively assesses the potential financial impact of these risks to\nidentify those with the highest potential impact. For such high-impact risks, the team collaborates with the risk\nowner to determine the necessity of additional mitigation efforts and the appropriate implementation approach\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n3. Outcomes of the assessment are provided to the ERM team, which incorporates any revisions to risk details,\nincluding risk ratings and mitigations, into the company’s Enterprise Risk profile.\nDisclose how the company\nidentifies, assesses, and manages\nclimate-related risks\nIn fiscal year 2021, we partnered with an independent consultant to conduct our first assessment, which was aimed\nat identifying climate-related risks and their underlying drivers for Atlassian. Following this, in fiscal year 2023,\nanother third party conducted a review of the identified risks and performed a gap assessment. In fiscal year 2024,\nwe engaged teams across Atlassian to guide the qualitative assessment of risk levels using Atlassian’s ERM risk\ncriteria. A specific subset of these risks was then selected based on their risk level for a climate scenario analysis\nand financial impact evaluation to determine Atlassian's exposure to these risks and their potential impact. As\na result of these analyses, we have not designated any climate risks as material beyond what is already indicated\nin annual and periodic reports with the SEC, nor have we integrated any into our ERM as of fiscal year 2024. We\nremain committed to monitoring our risks in relation to climate change and will integrate any risk that we assess\nwill have a material impact on the company’s risk profile if it arises.\nPlease see the GHG data tables in the appendix of Atlassian’s Fiscal Year 2024 Sustainability Report for disclosure\nMETRICS AND TARGETS\nof our scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions.\nDisclose the metrics and targets\nused to assess and manage relevant\nPlease see the Planet chapter in Atlassian’s Fiscal Year 2024 Sustainability Report for more information on our\nclimate-related risks and opportunities\nscience-based targets.\n*Further information on these risks and our risk management practices are included in and qualified by filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section\ntitled “Risk Factors” in our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports.

          "content": "Notice of FY25 Cloud Pricing and Packaging Changes from Atlassian Investor\nRelations\nOn September 17, 2024, we notified our customers of upcoming pricing and packaging\nchanges to certain cloud products and editions. The pricing changes primarily impact cloud\nlist prices, with the specific change varying depending on the product and edition. All of the\nchanges are effective October 16, 2024.\nThe impact of pricing and packaging changes is expected to feather in over time as cloud\nsubscriptions come up for renewal after the effective date. The estimated impact of pricing\non cloud revenue growth in FY25 is expected to be similar to the aggregate impact from\npricing seen in FY24.\nThese pricing and packaging changes were contemplated in our FY25 guidance provided on\nAugust 1, 2024.\nPrimary cloud pricing changes:\n• Jira and Confluence: 5% increase for Standard edition, 10% increase for Premium and\nEnterprise editions\n• Jira Service Management: ~8% increase for <250 users; 20% increase for >251 users\nWe are also making price changes to the following products and plans (note these\nchanges impact a relatively smaller cohort of customers):\n• Guard: 5-8% depending on the user tier\n• Bitbucket: 10%\n• Opsgenie: 5-10% depending on the edition\n• Compass: 14%\n• Legacy pricing plan (aka \"advantaged\" pricing) increases for Jira Service Management\n(Halp, Insights, and Automation), Bitbucket, and Opsgenie\nSeptember 24, 2024 1\nNotice of FY25 Cloud Pricing and Packaging Changes from Atlassian Investor\nRelations\nOther pricing and packaging changes for Jira Service Management:\n• Packaging updates: Advanced incident, problem, and change management capabilities\nwill be moving out of Free and Standard editions and into Premium and Enterprise\neditions\n• Consumption-based pricing for Assets and Virtual Service Agents (Premium and Enterprise\neditions):\n• Assets: Customers can store 50,000 Assets objects for free. Above this limit, objects\nwill start at $0.05(USD)/object/month with volume discounts applied\n• Virtual Service Agents: Customers can execute 1,000 Virtual Service Agent assisted\nconversations per month (or 12,000 per year) for free. Above this limit, assisted\nconversations will start at $0.30(USD)/assisted conversation/month with volume\ndiscounts applied\nIn the near term, the above packing updates and the introduction of consumption-based\npricing for Assets and Virtual Service Agents will primarily impact new Jira Service\nManagement cloud subscriptions. As such, we expect these pricing and packaging changes\nfor Jira Service Management to have an insignificant impact on FY25 Cloud revenue.\nAdditional information on these pricing and packaging changes can be found at https://\nwww.atlassian.com/licensing/future-pricing/cloud-pricing/faqs or https://\nwww.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/jsm-cloud-pricing-packaging-update\nIf you have any questions please contact IR@atlassian.com.\nSeptember 24, 2024 2"

These non-IFRS and non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are in addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance\nprepared in accordance with IFRS and U.S. GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-\nIFRS and non-GAAP financial measures versus their nearest respective IFRS and U.S. GAAP equivalents. For\nexample, other companies may calculate non-IFRS and non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other\nmeasures to evaluate their performance, any of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-IFRS and non-GAAP\nfinancial measures as tools for comparison.\nFurther information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in filings we make\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled “Risk Factors” in our\nmost recent Forms 20-F and 6-K (reporting our quarterly results).
