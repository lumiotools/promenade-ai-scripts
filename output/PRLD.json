We also demonstrated an encouraging early safety profile with no overlapping toxicities in our ongoing PRT3789 combination study with docetaxel. We are focused on completing monotherapy dose escalation and rapidly enrolling combination arms to support advancement of PRT3789 into next phase of development, initially in these two cancer types.”\n\nDr. Vaddi continued, “Additional accomplishments for the quarter include the commencement of patient enrollment for our first-in-class, highly selective oral SMARCA2 degrader, PRT7732 in a biomarker selected phase 1 trial. With two highly differentiated SMARCA2 degraders in the clinic, we are well-positioned to build on our leadership in this novel and important therapeutic class and provide optionality for patients. We look forward to reporting our progress on both of these programs beginning early 2025.”\n\nDr. Vaddi also added, “Other milestones for the quarter included presentation of first preclinical data from our Precision ADC program demonstrating the potential of SMARCA2/4 degrader as a potent and effective payload on multiple antibodies, as well as acceptance of interim clinical data in hematological malignancies of our potential best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor, PRT2527 at the American Society of Hematology Meeting in December.”\n\n**_Clinical Program Updates and Upcoming Milestones_**\n\n**PRT3789 – A first-in-class, highly selective, intravenous SMARCA2 Degrader** PRT3789 is designed to treat patients with a SMARCA4 mutation. Patients with SMARCA4-mutated cancer have a poor prognosis. This represents an area of high unmet medical need.\n\nPRT3789 is in Phase 1 clinical development in patients with biomarker selected SMARCA4-mutated cancers. Enrollment remains on track, and the Company expects to conclude monotherapy dose escalation by year-end 2024 and identify a dose for advancement to registrational trials. In addition, enrollment of patients into back-fill cohorts enriched for NSCLC and SMARCA4 loss-of-function mutations is ongoing, as is enrollment of the combination with docetaxel cohort. The Company also initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating PRT3789 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in patients with SMARCA4-mutated cancers, per the previously announced collaboration with Merck (known as MSD outside of the US and Canada).\n\n_KEYTRUDA® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA._\n\n**Interim Phase 1 data presented at medical congresses in Q3 2024** The Company presented the first interim clinical data updates of the Phase 1 dose escalation study of PRT3789 in SMARCA4 mutated cancers at ESMO Congress 2024 and the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium. The presentations can be found at [Publications - Prelude Therapeutics](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d7hAeD3N6wZj0sOciyRXlRhdflAETk0O6VsG1pX1Mbgpwnjc2cUJUCqCnUi6MXoyUMacpPvuyUeKCs_OmS6z5qF1KJZ39C4wqKdblCEBX-bKQszbdfFmGzXG38mxoKfWXjwmh78PsmqYMjsYjuMqNQ==).\n\nAs reported by investigators, PRT3789 was generally safe and well-tolerated at doses tested to date. Of the 26 advanced NSCLC or esophageal patients with Class 1 (loss of function) mutations who were evaluable for efficacy, RECIST confirmed partial responses (PRs) were observed in 4 patients (2 esophageal, 2 NSCLC). Of the 9 patients with Class 1 mutations treated at doses of 283 mg or higher, two had RECIST confirmed partial responses and both were NSCLC patients. Tumor shrinkage was observed in patients with both Class 1 and Class 2 SMARCA4 mutations. Additional patients on-study demonstrated clinical benefit as measured by prolonged SD, including one advanced NSCLC patient who remains stable and on study having been treated for more than a year.\n\nInitial observations of safety from evaluable patients in the PRT3789 plus docetaxel combination dose escalation arm of the trial were also presented. To date, PRT3789 in combination with docetaxel demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with no dose limiting toxicities or study drug serious adverse events reported.\n\n**PRT7732 – A potent, highly selective and orally bioavailable SMARCA2 Degrader** PRT7732 is a highly selective and orally bioavailable SMARCA2 degrader. The Company initiated and enrolled our first patients in a phase 1 multi-dose escalation trial of PRT7732 (NCT06560645) in biomarker selected SMARCA4 mutated cancers.\n\n**Pfizer Ignite Collaboration** Prelude has entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer Ignite enabling streamlined access to Ignite services in support of Prelude’s SMARCA2 degrader development programs. Per Pfizer, Ignite is a service offering providing partners access to Pfizer’s significant resources, scale and expertise in developing potentially breakthrough medicines. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Prelude retains full ownership and global license rights to all of its programs. **Precision ADC with SMARCA2/4 dual degrader payload** Prelude is developing potent SMARCA2/4 dual degraders that robustly inhibit cancer cell growth and induce cell death across multiple cancer types. The Company presented the first preclinical data from its Precision ADC platform at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium in October. The data demonstrated potent activity of a SMARCA 2/4 degrader payload when conjugated to a range of commercially available antibodies, including PSMA, TROP2, C-MET, CEACAM5, and CD33. The SMARCA2/4 degrader payload conjugated to an anti-PSMA antibody demonstrated tumor regressions and significantly better _in vivo_ efficacy compared to a traditional PSMA-targeted cytotoxic ADC in xenograft models of prostate cancer at well tolerated doses.

The Company is currently advancing PRT2527 as monotherapy in both lymphoid and myeloid hematological malignancies, and in combination with zanubrutinib in B-cell malignancies _._\n\nPRT2527 is expected to complete monotherapy dose escalation in B-cell malignancies this year. Initiation of dose escalation in myeloid malignancies occurred in the first half of 2024. Interim phase 1 clinical data with potentially best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor, PRT2527 in hematological malignancies will be presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2024. ** _Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable securities:** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were $153.6 million. The Company anticipates that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will fund Prelude’s operations into 2026. \n\n**Research and Development (R &D) Expenses:** For the third quarter of 2024, R&D expense increased to $29.5 million from $26.3 million for the prior year period. Included in the R&D expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.4 million of non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation expense, including employee stock options, compared to $3.3 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. Research and development expenses increased primarily due to an increase in our chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) costs supporting our pre-clinical and clinical programs. We expect our R&D expenses to vary from quarter to quarter, primarily due to the timing of our clinical development activities. \n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses:** For the third quarter of 2024, G&A expenses increased to $7.9 million from $7.1 million for the prior year period. Included in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $2.5 million of non-cash expense related to stock-based compensation expense, including employee stock options, compared to $3.4 million for three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in professional fees incurred to support our research and development efforts.\n\n**Net Loss:** For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net loss was $32.3 million, or $0.43 per share compared to $30.6 million, or $0.45 per share, for the prior year period. Included in the net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $5.9 million of non-cash expenses related to the impact of expensing share-based payments, including employee stock options, as compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2023. \n\n**_About Prelude Therapeutics_**\n\nPrelude Therapeutics is a leading precision oncology company developing innovative medicines in areas of high unmet need for cancer patients.

The data were presented at a plenary session of the 36th Annual EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nThe study investigators reported, as of September 23, 2024 (the Cutoff Date), additional follow up data on 65 patients that were enrolled, treated, and safety evaluable. PRT3789 was generally well-tolerated through 8 dosing cohorts. The majority of adverse events reported by investigators have been mild to moderate.\n\nOverall, of the 26 advanced, heavily pre-treated NSCLC or esophageal patients with Class 1 (loss of function) mutations evaluable for efficacy, now with additional follow up, RECIST partial responses (PRs) were confirmed in 4 patients, including 2 of 9 NSCLC patients with confirmed PRs at doses of 283 mg or higher. As anticipated, higher doses are resulting in deeper and more sustained SMARCA2 degradation in PBMCs. Additional patients demonstrated clinical benefit as measured by prolonged stable disease (SD) including one patient on treatment for more than a year.\n\n“We, along with our study investigators, are encouraged by the promising activity shown to date by PRT3789 in this novel first-in-class mechanism for patients who have limited treatment options,” stated Jane Huang, M.D., President and Chief Medical Officer of Prelude. “We look forward to further characterizing and understanding the full potential of PRT3789 through ongoing monotherapy dose escalation and in combination studies with both docetaxel and pembrolizumab.”\n\n**PRT3789 Interim Phase 1 Results** PRT3789 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing dose-escalation Phase 1 trial in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced solid tumors harboring any SMARCA4 mutation who have relapsed/refractory disease. Sixty-five patients with advanced cancer were treated once weekly via intravenous infusion at eight dose levels (24 mg, 48 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, 160 mg, 212 mg, 283 mg, 376 mg), and follow up data reported through to September 23, 2024. The median age of these patients was 62 and the median number of prior treatments was 3 (ranging from 1-10). 34 patients (52.3%) presented with a Class 1 (loss of function) SMARCA4 mutation, while 24 patients (36.9%) presented with a Class 2 (missense, VUS) SMARCA4 mutation and 7 (10.8%) had a loss of SMARCA4 protein.\n\n**Initial Safety Data** PRT3789 was generally well-tolerated. Treatment emergent adverse events of any grade observed to date consisted of nausea (26.2%), fatigue (21.5%), anemia (20.0%), decreased appetite (20.0%), abdominal pain (18.5%), and constipation (18.5%). No dose limiting toxicities were observed and no study drug-related serious adverse events were reported.\n\n**Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) Data** Preliminary PK data was available from 24 mg to 376 mg dose cohorts. A general trend of increases in exposure (Cmax, AUC) with dose was observed. Mean concentrations were observed above SMARCA2 plasma DC50 (21 nM) for approximately 8 hours at the 376 mg dose. No accumulation was observed with repeat dose administration, consistent with the half-life and once-weekly administration. PD effect (as measured by SMARCA2 protein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells) observed was more prolonged than PK half-life. Higher dose levels, above 212 mg, demonstrated a deeper, more consistent, and more prolonged PD effect. SMARCA2 degradation was observed in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in available tumor tissue as shown through biopsy.\n\n**Analysis of Initial Clinical Activity** Of the 26 advanced NSCLC or esophageal patients with Class 1 (loss of function) mutations who were evaluable for efficacy, RECIST confirmed partial responses (PRs) were observed in 4 patients (2 esophageal, 2 NSCLC), including 2 of 9 NSCLC patients with confirmed PRs at doses of 283 mg or higher. Tumor shrinkage was observed in patients with both Class 1 and Class 2 SMARCA4 mutations. Additional patients on-study demonstrated clinical benefit as measured by prolonged SD, including one advanced NSCLC patient who remains stable and on study having been treated for more than 1 year.\n\nInitial observations of safety from evaluable patients in the PRT3789 plus docetaxel combination dose escalation arm of the trial were also presented. To date, PRT3789 in combination with docetaxel demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, with no dose limiting toxicities or study drug serious adverse events reported.\n\n**Additional SMARCA Degrader Presentations**\n\nThe Company also provided two poster presentations at the conference.\n\n**The Selective SMARCA2 Degrader, PRT3789, Counteracts the Protective Cellular Stress Response to Chemotherapy and Enhances the Efficacy of Standard of Care Chemotherapeutic Agents in SMARCA4 Mutant NSCLC Models**\n\nThe combination of PRT3789 with standard of care NSCLC chemotherapy agents significantly enhances anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of SMARCA4-mutated NSCLC. Downregulation of dominant gene pathways by PRT3789, specifically counters docetaxel-induced upregulation of the E2F and G2/M pathways, resulting in a more comprehensive cell cycle blockade and increased apoptosis in SMARCA4-mutated cells. This synergistic activity was observed with both Class I (loss of function) mutations and Class II (missense) mutations.\n\n**Discovery of First-in-Class Precision Antibody Drug Conjugates with a Potent SMARCA 2/4 Dual Degrader Payloads that Safely Achieve Maximal and Tumor Specific Degradation and Efficacy in Mouse Models**\n\nPRP0004 is a potent SMARCA2/4 dual degrader that robustly inhibits cancer cell growth and induces cell death. Conjugation of PRP0004 to clinically-validated antibodies yielded novel degrader antibody conjugates (DACs), which demonstrated potent and antigen-selective internalization and SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 degradation in cell lines derived from multiple cancers. Prostate cancer cell lines were among the most sensitive to the PRP0004 degrader payload. PRP0004 downregulated multiple drivers of prostate cancer cell growth and survival and resulted in cell death, rationalizing the use of PSMA-targeting antibodies for initial proof-of-concept studies in preclinical models.\n\nAs expected, dosing with PRP0004 on its own was highly efficacious in prostate cancer xenografts but displayed a narrow therapeutic window. However, when delivered as a payload on anti-PSMA antibodies, the anti-PSMA SMARCA2/4 DACs demonstrate robust SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 degradation and antigen-dependent efficacy in xenograft models while being well-tolerated. These data highlight the potential of this first-in-class precision ADC approach utilizing a highly potent SMARCA2/4 dual degrader payload to achieve maximal target degradation in tumors while sparing healthy tissues. This strategy has the potential to significantly expand the reach of Prelude’s novel SMARCA degraders to treating patients without SMARCA4 mutations.\n\n“Preclinical data presented today with our novel approach to develop degrader antibody conjugates by using potent dual degraders of SMARCA2 and 4 as payloads offers first proof-of-concept of effectively and safely targeting an important mechanism to treat cancers beyond those with SMARCA4 mutations” stated Peggy Scherle, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Prelude.\n\nAll of the above noted presentations can be found at [_Publications - Prelude Therapeutics (preludetx.com)_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=En_h1WvK9HLA6bIzXyBYHrmAOWyJnT5inyytIiJEuIzhsTcAmHiUPC8BR90jms7uIG6QrKKd_bsiyWqMrnmtHuOWGW86VCGPHFBo_LuEHj7AN6y6Wa12xwinbePpk9oleLxS5Bbhy13Nd9EbKn6tTRDeR3BXE-fNdG2NSZeAXuA=).\n\n**_About PRT3789-01_** PRT3789 is a first-in-class, potent and highly selective SMARCA2 degrader, in Phase 1 clinical development in SMARCA4-mutated patients. Enrollment remains on track, and the Company expects to conclude monotherapy dose escalation by year end 2024 and identify the biologically active dose to advance for future registrational trials. In addition, enrollment of patients into back-fill cohorts enriched for NSCLC and SMARCA4 loss-of-function mutations at higher dose levels is ongoing. The objective is to assess clinical activity in a more homogeneous group of patients with high unmet need to support planned discussions with regulatory agencies. A maximum tolerated dose has not yet been identified. Dose escalation continues, now in the 10th dosing cohort (665 mg IV once weekly).\n\n**_About Prelude Therapeutics_**\n\nPrelude Therapeutics is a leading precision oncology company developing innovative medicines in areas of high unmet need for cancer patients.
