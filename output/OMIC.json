(Nasdaq: OMIC), a company leveraging novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) and spatial multiomics technologies to empower researchers and clinicians, today highlighted recent corporate achievements and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“In the third quarter, we made significant progress in the development of the G4X spatial sequencer,” said Drew Spaventa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Singular Genomics. “We are encouraged by the interest in the G4X and validation received through the expansion of our Spatial Technology Access Services project funnel, which reinforces our confidence in the potential for the G4X to deliver high-throughput spatial sequencing and multiomics at a superior value for our customers.”\n\n**Recent Updates**\n\n  * Shipped the first G4X Early Access instrument\n  * Presented new data sets at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) conference, which: \n    * highlighted the G4X’s performance, showcasing data for healthy and cancerous lung, breast, colon and kidney tissues; and\n    * showcased the capability of Direct-Seq for single-cell immune repertoire profiling in a spatial context through direct B- and T-cell receptor sequencing in FFPE tissue\n  * Shipped two G4 systems in the third quarter of 2024\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.4 million, driven primarily by consumables sales. Revenue from instrument shipments during the third quarter is expected to be generated over time as these customers purchase consumables.\n\nGross profit was negative $0.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to negative $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the company’s use of reagent rental and other non-capital purchase instrument placements, as well as higher costs associated with the support of system placements, which was partially offset by higher margins on consumable sales.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $17.8 million, compared to $24.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses included non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, and $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were partially offset by a non-cash gain of $1.6 million on lease modification for the partial termination of a lease agreement.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.8 million, or a loss of $6.72 per common share, compared to $22.4 million, or a loss of $9.25 per common share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding restricted cash, as of September 30, 2024 totaled $113.8 million.\n\nDue to ongoing discussions related to a potential strategic transaction, the company will not host a conference call to discuss its third quarter results. For further details regarding the company’s financial performance, please refer to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 available on the company’s website at [www.singulargenomics.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=M0Bmjx72L4JblflSl-my4mkIQR-QpP0LRrMrD0KCcHLCMqDycgjt6SxM8xyESKS6mw8frf_3ErH9PEp3eTGmu1jvv-7-J_KrLJrlQP3BJurV5YxaLGRhnzGwoyb4g8mnmRKp8h5LpJUOTinp1nksgIcQurgTMB-XlBmjXMue7_fA2th1a2ygkvEZnmvegUdvuQfblnsRNDoPgjrzn-a3aR9QDcPwcPW_knAbVV9c_k3oJCD_TRmlfxFWtgQtXaGDrgOSCm2q6wkOJqVpyTNLRj_rx6afm99lu3ddpjB1vDe5cevseSE2Cu1OQ1bMzGVK__kX6UrGv2FnpQ3FLLg9vhvBQSd85AKK4wq_mXDn0kAZOcI4-UQs09e7xGO92DciwBi4aBfs2qUQrY5CXRIOxw==) or at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=M0Bmjx72L4JblflSl-my4j3OZkzWem8ODX65AEhXNsnB2pssd--R92g8ULhGq1czVRe9eZ8OFOMRLJGwRdHDMImJTEFbflYLTeVw9yeconJDClDM5YWy-UQFabx5wL3-vQr3cGsMiTKL2f5u5Wt8RizlDsDiDK5u5RYz7LJSgGQydlNEt_iwEaIdfeS_TveSJjUxaFMNZeYacFZQ4COT-un8XSakdYJ87DHeLvgnEF_lyriJzm5Peme_SZLc5LMnFS85m_3HjUygMQprjV5SmTfv4ZXLmaE9ZYTioVl-9Ed3hY4PcgPKKoYiR-V2Wke_c-QdulPlJmmeTeHct6fxy9qAqTldX54M7oqQpyf_BRkj4lmuaMGU6TemC41g6M36).\n\n**About Singular Genomics Systems, Inc.**\n\nSingular Genomics is a life science technology company that develops next-generation sequencing and multiomics technologies.

(Nasdaq: OMIC), a company leveraging novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) and spatial multiomics technologies to empower researchers and clinicians, today highlighted recent corporate achievements and reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“It was another busy and productive quarter for our team as we progressed development of the G4X Spatial Sequencer while supporting our G4 customers,” said Drew Spaventa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Singular Genomics. “The early interest in our Spatial Technology Access Services is an encouraging sign that the unique capabilities and higher sample throughput of the G4X will serve an unmet need in the market.”\n\n**G4X Spatial Sequencer Updates**\n\n  * Advanced G4X platform development, and are preparing for early access in late 2024\n  * Commenced Spatial Sequencing Technology Access Services program with an initial focus on the V1 immuno-oncology panel\n  * Opened a Spatial Research Grant award program and received over 50 applications from globally renowned institutions interested in spatial sequencing for various applications\n\n\n\n**Recent Financial and Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Recognized revenue of $0.7 million in the second quarter of 2024\n  * Shipped 2 G4 systems in the second quarter of 2024\n  * Amended a long-term lease obligation, right sizing the company’s facilities footprint and reducing long-term lease obligations by approximately $50 million\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $0.7 million, predominantly made up of $0.4 million from revenue recognized on consumables sales and $0.3 million from revenue recognized on one capital purchase instrument placement during the quarter. Revenue from the other instrument shipment occurring during the second quarter is expected to be generated over time as the customer purchases consumables.\n\nGross profit was negative $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to negative $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2023. Gross margin was negative due to discounts on G4 instrument sales, the company’s use of the reagent rental and other non-capital purchase models, and higher costs associated with the support of system placements, partially offset by higher margins on increased consumable sales.\n\nOperating expenses for the second quarter of 2024 totaled $22.6 million, compared to $27.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. Operating expenses included non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, and $2.8 million for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $21.3 million, or a loss of $8.57 per common share, compared to $25.6 million, or a loss of $10.58 per common share, in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding restricted cash, as of June 30, 2024 totaled $133.2 million.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nSingular Genomics’ management team will host a conference call today, August 13, 2024, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

(Nasdaq: OMIC), a company leveraging novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) and spatial multiomics technologies to empower researchers and clinicians, today highlighted recent corporate achievements and reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n“The first quarter was productive and encouraging. We are focused on supporting our existing customers and getting the G4X spatial sequencer to market as quickly as possible,” said Drew Spaventa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Singular Genomics. “Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we plan to expand our spatial services offering and lay the foundation for a successful G4X launch in 2025.”\n\n**First Quarter and Recent Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Recognized revenue of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2024.\n  * Shipped six G4 systems in the first quarter of 2024, increasing the total number of commercial systems shipped to 30 as of the end of the first quarter of 2024.\n  * Showcased new G4X data sets that highlighted performance in FFPE samples and presented data from two initial Technology Access Partner projects at the American Association for Cancer Research 2024 conference in San Diego.\n  * Presented on the latest updates to the G4 sequencing platform and planned advances in spatial sequencing with the G4X at the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities conference in Minneapolis.\n\n\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $0.4 million, consisting primarily of revenue recognized from one G4 instrument capital purchase and consumables sales during the quarter.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: (i) our timeline and successful development of the G4X; (ii) expected features, capabilities and specifications of the G4X and the ability to deliver associated services and generate associated instrument and consumables sales; (iii) our ability to successfully manufacture, commercialize and support the G4, G4X and our flow cell kits, in accordance with our timelines, objectives and specifications; and (iv) quotes of management. Any such forward-looking statements are based on our management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual future results to differ materially from our management’s current expectations or those implied by our forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) we are currently developing the G4X Spatial Sequencer and related services and may not be successful in completing its development on our projected timeline, with the features and capabilities we expect, or at the cost we anticipate; (ii) we have very little history manufacturing and commercializing our products, technology or services; (iii) the life sciences technology market is highly competitive, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business and operating results will suffer; (iv) if we are sued for infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our products; (v) if our products fail to achieve early customer and scientific acceptance, we may not be able to achieve broader market acceptance for our products, and our revenues and prospects may be harmed; (vi) we expect to be highly dependent on revenue generated from the sale of the G4, G4X, G4X services and future products, and any delay or failure by us to successfully manufacture and commercialize these products and services could have a substantial adverse effect on our business and results of operations; and (vii) recent macroeconomic challenges such as inflation and rising interest rates may materially and adversely impact our business, operations, product manufacturing and commercialization objectives.

(Nasdaq: OMIC), a company leveraging novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) and spatial multiomics technologies to empower researchers and clinicians, today highlighted recent corporate achievements and reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n“We ended 2023 on a strong note, shipping our largest number of quarterly instruments to-date,” said Drew Spaventa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Singular Genomics. “We continue to build momentum in early 2024 with the recent unveiling of the G4X, the first _in situ_ spatial sequencer. The G4X brings sequencing into tissue sections, offering new capabilities and novel data streams with industry-leading throughput and cost.”\n\n**Fourth Quarter and Recent Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Generated revenue of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, representing growth of 41% compared to prior year period and 134% compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Shipped eight G4 systems in the fourth quarter of 2023, increasing the total number of commercial systems shipped to 24 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n  * Implemented additional cost-cutting measures in March 2024 to support the Company’s launch into spatial sequencing, including a workforce reduction of approximately 20%, to reduce operating expenses and extend cash runway.\n\n\n\n**Product Roadmap Highlights**\n\n  * Unveiled the G4X™ Spatial Sequencer, a high-throughput _in situ_ spatial sequencing platform capable of simultaneous direct RNA sequencing, targeted transcriptomics, proteomics and fluorescent H&E from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. The G4X is expected to be the only instrument to offer the capabilities for both NGS and tissue-based _in situ_ spatial multiomics including: \n    * Industry-leading Throughput – An imaging area of 40 cm2 per run across four spatial flow cells is expected to dramatically increase sample throughput while retaining flexibility for smaller runs.\n    * Rapid Turn-around-time – With a specialized tissue transfer process, streamlined sample preparation workflow, and high-speed single-day sequencing, users will have the ability to go from sample-to-discovery in just three days.\n    * Cost-Effectiveness – With its unprecedented throughput, the G4X will significantly reduce the cost per sample to less than half that of alternative approaches, making spatial multiomics more accessible.\n    * Upgrades expected to be available to G4 customers by the end of 2024, and to launch an early access program at the same time.\n  * Announced updates to the G4 benchtop sequencing system including: \n    * Increased sequencing quality with G4 runs now averaging above 90% bases ≥ Q30; raised specifications to 85% bases ≥ Q30.\n    * Showcased Singular Connect™, a web-based application for remote real-time monitoring of runs, results viewing, and instrument and team management.\n\n\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.1 million, compared to $0.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing growth of 41% compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by eight instrument shipments during the quarter.\n\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $24.8 million, compared to $22.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating expenses included non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The year over year increase was primarily driven by the timing of expenses related to certain compensation and benefits and severance costs.\n\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $23.2 million, or a loss of $0.32 per common share, compared to $21.1 million, or a loss of $0.29 per common share, in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n**Full Year 2023 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the full year of 2023 was $2.9 million compared to $0.8 million in 2022. We began recognizing revenue on sales of the G4 in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nOperating expenses for 2023 totaled $102.2 million compared to $93.5 million in 2022. Operating expenses included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $11.4 million in 2023 and $13.7 million in 2022. The year-over-year increase in total operating expenses was driven primarily by scaling headcount and infrastructure to support growth, including the G4 commercial launch and advancements of the product pipeline and R&D roadmap.\n\nNet loss for 2023 was $94.8 million, or a loss of $1.30 per common share, compared to $90.9 million, or a loss of $1.28 per common share, in 2022.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding restricted cash, as of December 31, 2023 totaled $173.9 million.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nSingular Genomics’ management team will host a conference call today, March 18, 2024, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

(Nasdaq: OMIC), a company leveraging novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiomics technologies to empower researchers and clinicians, today highlighted recent corporate achievements and reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n“We shipped five G4 systems in the third quarter, our highest quarterly total yet, launched Max Read flow cell kits for single cell sequencing, and saw our largest number of quarterly consumable kit orders,” said Drew Spaventa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Singular Genomics. “In the near term, we will be building our installed base more aggressively and prioritizing fewer yet higher impact products on our product roadmap. We have also cut costs to extend runway, providing time to build our installed base, get high-impact products to market, and scale revenue.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Generated revenue of $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Shipped five G4 systems in the third quarter of 2023, increasing the total number of commercial systems shipped to 16 as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Converted the majority of the installed base to F3 flow cells, allowing users to get up to 450 million reads per flow cell, or 1.8 billion reads per run, for some of the most widely run applications.\n  * Completed the early access program and commenced the broad commercial launch of Max Read flow cell kits for single cell sequencing, enabling 800 million reads per flow cell, or 3.2 billion reads per run.\n  * Implemented cost-cutting measures, including a workforce reduction of approximately 10%, to reduce operating expenses and extend cash runway into the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2023 was $0.5 million, driven primarily by recognition of sales on one instrument placement. The company expects revenue from the remaining four instrument shipments to be recognized over time as customers purchase consumables for these instruments.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 totaled $24.5 million, compared to $24.7 million for the third quarter of 2022. Operating expenses included non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2023 and $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2022. The year over year decrease in total operating expenses was driven primarily by a decrease in research and development materials and other general lab supply costs as the company transitioned from development to commercialization of the G4.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2023 was $22.4 million, or a loss of $0.31 per common share, compared to $23.8 million, or a loss of $0.33 per common share, for the third quarter of 2022.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding restricted cash, totaled $190.7 million as of September 30, 2023.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nSingular Genomics’ management team will host a conference call today, November 14, 2023, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

(Nasdaq: OMIC), a company leveraging novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiomics technologies to empower researchers and clinicians, today highlighted recent corporate achievements and reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\n“We made significant advancements across our operations, manufacturing and commercial infrastructure, and saw growth in our sales funnel. In addition, we shipped three G4 systems, commenced the broad commercial launch of F3 flow cells and consumable kits and are shipping Max Read kits for single cell sequencing to early access customers,” said Drew Spaventa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Singular Genomics. “These recent product launches, as well as our growing customer base and strong sales funnel, position us favorably to ramp commercialization of the G4 in the second half of 2023.”\n\n**Second Quarter and Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Generated revenue of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Shipped three G4 systems in the second quarter of 2023, increasing the installed base of commercial systems shipped to 11 as of the end of the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Commenced the broad commercial launch of the F3 flow cells and consumable kits, allowing users to get up to 450 million reads per flow cell, or 1.8 billion reads per run, for some of the most widely run applications.\n  * Initiated shipments of Max Read kits for single cell sequencing to early access customers, enabling 800 million reads per flow cell, or 3.2 billion reads per run.\n  * Expanded commercial infrastructure in Europe to support our international growth strategy.\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $0.5 million, driven primarily by recognition of sales on two instrument placements.\n\nOperating expenses for the second quarter of 2023 totaled $27.5 million, compared to $24.2 million for the second quarter of 2022. Operating expenses included non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.8 million for the second quarter of 2023 and $3.6 million for the second quarter of 2022. The year over year increase in total operating expenses was driven primarily by scaling headcount, facilities and infrastructure to support commercialization of the G4 and development of our product roadmap.\n\nNet loss for the second quarter of 2023 was $25.6 million, or a loss of $0.35 per common share, compared to $24.0 million, or a loss of $0.34 per common share, in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding restricted cash, totaled $206.7 million as of June 30, 2023.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nSingular Genomics’ management team will host a conference call today, August 9, 2023, beginning at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

These risks and uncertainties include and are not limited to the following: (i) we have incurred significant losses since inception, we expect to incur significant losses in the future and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability; (ii) we have very little history manufacturing and commercializing our products or technology; (iii) the life sciences technology market is highly competitive, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business and operating results will suffer; (iv) if we are sued for infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our products; (v) if our products fail to achieve early customer and scientific acceptance, we may not be able to achieve broader market acceptance for our products, and our revenues and prospects may be harmed; (vi) we expect to be highly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of the G4 and planned PX, and any delay or failure by us to successfully manufacture and commercialize the G4 and planned PX could have a substantial adverse effect on our business and results of operations; and (vii) the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to reduce its spread and recent macroeconomic challenges have adversely impacted, and may materially and adversely impact, our business, operations and product manufacturing and commercialization objectives. These and other risk factors that may affect our future results of operations are identified and described in more detail in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and in other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on May 9, 2023.
