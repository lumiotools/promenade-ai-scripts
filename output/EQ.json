(Nasdaq: EQ), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging a deep understanding of immunobiology to develop novel therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, today announced financial results for the third quarter 2024 and provided corporate and clinical updates. \n\n“At the end of October we announced that our partnership with Ono Pharmaceutical had ended following substantial non-dilutive financing that has fully funded itolizumab research and development since July 2022. This funding enabled us to advance the program through two recent milestones – positive interim review from the Phase 3 EQUATOR study in acute graft-versus-host disease and positive topline data from the EQUALISE study in lupus nephritis. Ono informed us that their decision was strategic in nature, and that the data we have delivered from these studies met expectations with no observed or reported safety concerns,” said Bruce Steel, chief executive officer at Equillium. “We have enrolled over 150 patients in EQUATOR, and as of the end of October have temporarily paused enrollment to review clinical options for the program, including the potential to accelerate our timeline to topline data to the first quarter of 2025 while preserving registrational integrity of the study. We maintain orphan drug and fast track designations for first-line acute graft-versus-host disease, where currently no drugs are approved. In addition, in collaboration with Equillium, our partner Biocon has recently completed a robust placebo-controlled Phase 2 study of itolizumab in biologic-naïve patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, and we expect topline data from this study also in the first quarter of 2025. We remain enthusiastic about the therapeutic potential and commercial opportunity for itolizumab, and we are very pleased to maintain our rights to the program as we approach the two most important data events in Equillium’s history.” \n\n**Highlights Since the Beginning of the Third Quarter of 2024:**\n\n  * Retained rights to itolizumab following Ono partnership \n  * Positive interim analysis of Phase 3 EQUATOR study of itolizumab in acute graft-versus-host disease subjects \n  * Phase 2 ulcerative colitis study completed by partner Biocon \n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming Milestones:**\n\n  * Itolizumab: Topline data from Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis – Q1 2025 \n  * Itolizumab: Topline data from Phase 3 EQUATOR study in aGVHD – potential acceleration to Q1 2025 \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Revenue_ ** for the third quarter of 2024 was $12.2 million, compared to $8.9 million during the same period in 2023. Revenue in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 consisted entirely of itolizumab development funding and amortization of the upfront payment related to our former partnership with Ono. \n\n**_Research and development (R &D) expenses_ ** for the third quarter of 2024 were $9.6 million, compared to $9.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to greater expenses associated with chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) activities related to itolizumab, greater non-clinical research expenses, and an increase in employee compensation expenses, which were partially offset by lower clinical study expenses primarily driven by the EQUALISE and EQ101 clinical studies, partially offset by greater expenses for our EQUATOR clinical study. \n\n**_General and administrative (G &A) expenses_ ** for the third quarter of 2024 were $3.3 million, compared with $3.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower legal, audit and tax professional fees. \n\n**_Net loss_ ** for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $7,000, or $(0.00) per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss of $3.7 million, or $(0.11) per basic and diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net loss was primarily attributable to greater revenue related to the Ono partnership, lower income tax expense, and other income, which were partially offset by the increase in R&D expense. \n\n**_Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments_ ** totaled $25.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $33.3 million as of June 30, 2024. Equillium believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are sufficient to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2025, assuming certain operational changes including accelerating the completion of the Phase 3 EQUATOR study based on reduced enrollment and early unblinding of the study, pausing further development activities related to EQ101 and EQ302, the elimination of certain positions and the reduction of certain discretionary expenditures, as well as assuming no further repurchases under our stock repurchase program. \n\n**About Equillium**\n\nEquillium is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging a deep understanding of immunobiology to develop novel therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders with high unmet medical need. The company’s pipeline consists of the following novel first-in-class immunomodulatory assets and product platform targeting immuno-inflammatory pathways. Itolizumab: a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway which plays a central role in the modulation of effector T cells that drive a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases; currently under evaluation in a Phase 3 clinical study of patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and announced positive data from a Phase 1b clinical study of patients with lupus/lupus nephritis in April 2024. Equillium acquired rights to itolizumab through an exclusive partnership with Biocon Limited, who also provides commercial manufacturing for the product. EQ101: a selective tri-specific cytokine inhibitor targeting IL-2, IL-9, and IL-15; recently announced positive results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study of patients with alopecia areata. EQ302: an orally delivered, selective bi-specific cytokine inhibitor targeting IL-15 and IL-21 at pre-clinical stage. \n\nFor more information, visit [www.equilliumbio.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.equilliumbio.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54152491&newsitemid=20241113027002&lan=en-US&anchor=www.equilliumbio.com&index=1&md5=1544130b3bcd9c6c7c9333330aa5d6a3). \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\n_Statements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are “forward-looking Statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas from November 6 to 10, 2024. \n\n“These data provide deeper insights into the dual and synergistic signaling of IL-15 and IL-21 that drives aggressive T and NK cell responses that promote the cytolytic activity and interferon gamma production observed in multiple inflammatory diseases,” said Dr. Stephen Connelly, chief scientific officer at Equillium. “As such, in the context of treating inflammatory disease, or augmenting anti-tumor responses, it would be optimal to inhibit or activate both cytokines in a single agent and is a focus of the multi-cytokine platform at Equillium.” \n\n**Title:** Interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-21 synergistically enhance NK and CD8+ T cell responses **Presenting Author:** Phoi Tiet, Senior Research Associate, Equillium, Inc. **Poster Number:** 908 \n\n****K** ey Highlights, Summaries & Conclusions from Presentation: **\n\n  * Synergistic signaling of IL-15 and IL-21 enhanced markers of activity including CD25, PD-1, Tim-3 and ICOS, in addition to increased production of granzyme A, granzyme B and perforin, indicating that these two cytokines play important roles in activation, development, and survival of NK and CD8+ T cells. \n  * IL-15 and IL-21 cooperatively amplified CD8+T and NK cytolytic activities and IFNγ production, suggesting that targeting these two pathways can amplify cell-based immunity. \n  * Preliminary evaluation of IL-15 and IL-21 in an antigen-based T cell exhaustion model described here suggests that the combination of the two cytokines has a modest effect on reversing the phenotype and function of terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells as shown by the increase in the percentage of TCF-1 positive cells, decrease in the percentage of TOX positive cells, and increase the percentage of polyfunctional cells. \n  * These results indicate that the combination of IL-15 and IL-21 robustly augments NK and CD8 T cell activity. The ability to not only boost cytolytic function of naïve and effector cells but to partially rescue the exhausted phenotype of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells is a promising therapeutic approach and addresses the challenges of immuno-oncology. \n\n\n\nThe poster presentation is available under the Multi-Cytokine Inhibition tab on the [Presentations page](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.equilliumbio.com%2Ftechnology%2FPresentations-Technology%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54150752&newsitemid=20241112779037&lan=en-US&anchor=Presentations+page&index=2&md5=52069a357656ef32312e3438c33cb12b) of the Technology section on the corporate website. \n\n**About Multi-Cytokine Platform and Multi-Cytokine Inhibitors EQ101 & EQ302**\n\nOur proprietary [multi-cytokine](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.equilliumbio.com%2Ftechnology%2FMulti-Cytokine-Platform%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54150752&newsitemid=20241112779037&lan=en-US&anchor=multi-cytokine&index=3&md5=fce6f003574376003ef9265ed621f5d4) platform generates rationally designed composite peptides that selectively block key cytokines at the shared receptor level targeting pathogenic cytokine redundancies and synergies while preserving non-pathogenic signaling. This approach is expected to avoid the broad immuno-suppression and off-target safety liabilities that may be associated with other therapeutic classes, such as Janus kinase inhibitors. Many immune-mediated diseases are driven by the same combination of dysregulated cytokines, and we believe identifying the key cytokines for these diseases will allow us to target and develop customized treatment strategies for multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. \n\nCurrent platform assets include EQ101, a clinical stage, first-in-class, selective, tri-specific inhibitor of IL-2, IL-9, and IL-15 for intravenous and subcutaneous delivery and EQ302, a preclinical stage, first-in-class, selective, bi-specific inhibitor of IL-15 and IL-21 for oral delivery. \n\n**About Equillium**\n\nEquillium is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging a deep understanding of immunobiology to develop novel therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune and inflammatory disorders with high unmet medical need. The company’s pipeline consists of the following novel first-in-class immunomodulatory assets and product platform targeting immuno-inflammatory pathways. Itolizumab: a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD6-ALCAM signaling pathway which plays a central role in the modulation of effector T cells that drive a number of immuno-inflammatory diseases; currently under evaluation in a Phase 3 clinical study of patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and announced positive data from a Phase 1b clinical study of patients with lupus/lupus nephritis in April 2024. Equillium acquired rights to itolizumab through an exclusive partnership with Biocon Limited, who also provides commercial manufacturing for the product. EQ101: a selective tri-specific cytokine inhibitor targeting IL-2, IL-9, and IL-15; recently announced positive results from a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study of patients with alopecia areata. EQ302: an orally delivered, selective bi-specific cytokine inhibitor targeting IL-15 and IL-21 at pre-clinical stage. \n\nFor more information, visit [www.equilliumbio.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.equilliumbio.com%2Fhome%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54150752&newsitemid=20241112779037&lan=en-US&anchor=www.equilliumbio.com&index=4&md5=047e138fb47aa1d3885ff65f328b295e). \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\n_Statements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
