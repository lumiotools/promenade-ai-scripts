Net revenues for the third quarter were $115.8 million, up nine percent from the prior quarter and down eight percent from the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $14.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to $0.09 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $0.34 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $32.9 million. \n\nIn addition to its GAAP results, the company provided non-GAAP measures that exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the related tax effects. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $22.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared to $0.28 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results is included with the tables accompanying this press release. \n\nCommented Balu Balakrishnan, chairman and CEO of Power Integrations: “Our third-quarter results were on target, and while our outlook reflects soft end-market demand, particularly in consumer appliances, we nevertheless expect double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In light of our strong balance sheet, our board of directors has authorized $50 million for share repurchases and increased our quarterly dividend by five percent. \n\n“Progress on our PowiGaN™ technology roadmap continues apace, with the introduction earlier this week of the world’s first 1700-volt gallium-nitride transistors in our InnoMux™-2 product family. As PowiGaN technology reaches ever-higher voltage and power capabilities, it becomes an increasingly attractive, lower-cost alternative to silicon carbide. At the same time, its cost is approaching parity with the most advanced high-voltage silicon MOSFETs, but with far superior performance.” \n\n**Additional Highlights**\n\n  * Power Integrations’ board of directors has authorized the use of $50 million for the repurchase of the company’s common shares, subject to pre-determined price/volume thresholds. The authorization does not have an expiration date. \n  * The company paid a dividend of $0.20 per share on September 30, 2024; a dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on December 31, 2024, to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe company issued the following forecast for the fourth quarter of 2024: \n\n  * Revenues are expected to be $105 million plus or minus $5 million. \n  * GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 54 percent and 54.5 percent, and non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 55 percent and 55.5 percent. The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins is approximately equally attributable to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. \n  * GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $53.5 million and $54 million; non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $44.5 million and $45 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to exclude approximately $9 million of stock-based compensation. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time**\n\nPower Integrations management will hold a conference call today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time. A live webcast of the call will be available on the investor section of the company's website, [ _http://investors.power.com_ ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.power.com&esheet=54148291&newsitemid=20241106320623&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.power.com&index=2&md5=8e23368341358dab38327d9c935bb658).

The company’s products are key building blocks in the clean-power ecosystem, enabling the generation of renewable energy as well as the efficient transmission and consumption of power in applications ranging from milliwatts to megawatts. For more information, please visit [ _www.power.com_ ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.power.com&esheet=54148291&newsitemid=20241106320623&lan=en-US&anchor=www.power.com&index=5&md5=18a6af4803a3abd191640fce71107b3c). \n\n**Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the company's consolidated financial statements, which are presented according to GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information that excludes stock-based compensation expenses recorded under ASC 718-10, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the tax effects of these items. The company uses these measures in its financial and operational decision-making and, with respect to one measure, in setting performance targets for compensation purposes. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures offer important analytical tools to help investors understand its operating results, and to facilitate comparability with the results of companies that provide similar measures. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. For example, stock-based compensation is an important component of the company’s compensation mix and will continue to result in significant expenses in the company’s GAAP results for the foreseeable future but is not reflected in the non-GAAP measures. Also, other companies, including companies in Power Integrations’ industry, may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are attached to this press release. \n\n**Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThe above statements regarding the company’s forecast for its fourth-quarter financial performance are forward-looking statements reflecting management's current expectations and beliefs. These statements are based on current information that is, by its nature, subject to rapid and even abrupt change. Due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, actual results could differ materially from those projected or implied by these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the company’s ability to supply products and its ability to conduct other aspects of its business such as competing for new design wins; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, including such factors as inflation, armed conflicts and trade negotiations, which may impact the level of demand for the company’s products; potential changes and shifts in customer demand away from end products that utilize the company's integrated circuits to end products that do not incorporate the company's products; the effects of competition, which may cause the company’s revenues to decrease or cause the company to decrease its selling prices for its products; unforeseen costs and expenses; and unfavorable fluctuations in component costs or operating expenses resulting from changes in commodity prices and/or exchange rates. In addition, new product introductions and design wins are subject to the risks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the marketplace, including product development delays and defects and market acceptance of the new products. These and other risk factors that may cause actual results to differ are more fully explained under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2024. The company is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. \n\n_Power Integrations, PowiGaN, InnoMux and the Power Integrations logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Power Integrations, Inc.

Simply complete and mail the voting instruction form or follow the voting instructions in the Notice to ensure that\nyour vote is counted.

Brokers and nominees can use their discretion to vote “uninstructed” shares with\nrespect to matters that are considered to be “routine,” but not with respect to “non-routine” matters. Under the applicable rules and\ninterpretations of the NYSE, “non-routine” matters are matters that may substantially affect the rights or privileges of stockholders, such\nas mergers, stockholder proposals, elections of directors (even if not contested), executive compensation (including any advisory\nstockholder votes on executive compensation and on the frequency of stockholder votes on executive compensation), and certain\ncorporate governance proposals, even if management supported. Accordingly, your broker or nominee may not vote your shares on\nProposals 1, 2 or 4 without your instructions but may vote your shares on Proposal 3.\nWhat if I return a proxy card or otherwise vote but do not make specific choices?\nIf you return a signed and dated proxy card or otherwise vote without marking voting selections, your shares will be voted, as\napplicable, “For” the election of all our seven nominees for director, “For” the advisory approval of executive compensation, and “For”\nthe ratification of the Audit Committee’s selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of\nPower Integrations for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2024; your shares will not be voted on the stockholder proposal for simple\nmajority vote. If any other matter is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy holder (one of the individuals named on your\nproxy card) will vote your shares using his or her best judgment.\n3\nWho is paying for this proxy solicitation?\nWe will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, our directors and employees may also\nsolicit proxies in person, by telephone, or by other means of communication. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional\ncompensation for soliciting proxies. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy\nmaterials to beneficial owners.\nWhat does it mean if I receive more than one Notice or set of proxy materials?\nIf you receive more than one Notice or set of proxy materials, your shares may be registered in more than one name or in\ndifferent accounts. Please follow the voting instructions on the proxy cards in the proxy materials or Notices to ensure that all of your\nshares are voted.\nCan I change my vote or revoke my proxy after submitting my proxy?\nStockholder of Record; Shares Registered in Your Name\nYes. You can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting. If you are the\nrecord holder of your shares, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:\n• You may submit another properly completed proxy card with a later date.\n• You may vote again over the internet or by telephone.\n• You may send a timely written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Power Integrations’ Corporate Secretary at\n5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002.\n• You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote at the Annual Meeting. Simply attending the Annual Meeting will not,\nby itself, revoke your proxy.\nYour most current proxy card or telephone or internet proxy is the one that is counted.\nBeneficial Owner; Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank\nIf your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you should follow the instructions provided by your\nbroker or bank.\nWhen are stockholder proposals due for next year’s annual meeting?\nTo be considered for inclusion in next year’s proxy materials, your proposal must be submitted in writing by\nNovember 29, 2024, to our Corporate Secretary at 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002; provided, however, that if\nour 2025 annual meeting of stockholders is held before April 17, 2025, or after June 16, 2025, then the deadline is a reasonable amount\nof time prior to the date we begin to print and mail our proxy statement for the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. If you wish to\nsubmit a proposal that is not to be included in next year’s proxy materials or nominate a director pursuant to our Bylaws, you must\nprovide specified information in writing to our Corporate Secretary at the address above by November 29, 2024, except that if our 2025\nannual meeting of stockholders is held before April 17, 2025, or after June 16, 2025, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be\nreceived not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement of the date of such\nmeeting is made. You are also advised to review our Bylaws, which contain a description of the information required to be submitted\nas well as additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under our Bylaws, to comply with the universal proxy rules, stockholders\nwho intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the Company’s nominees must provide in their notice any\nadditional information required by Rule 14a-19(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\nHow are votes counted?\nVotes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will separately count, with respect\nto the proposal to elect directors, votes “For,” “Withhold” and broker non-votes; and with respect to other proposals, votes “For,”\n“Against,” abstentions and, if applicable, broker non-votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect and will not be counted\ntowards the vote total for any proposal.\nWhat are “broker non-votes”?\nWhen a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” does not give instructions to the broker or nominee holding the shares\nas to how to vote on matters deemed by the NYSE to be “non-routine,” the broker or nominee cannot vote the shares. These unvoted\nshares are counted as “broker non-votes.”\n4\nHow many votes are needed to elect directors?\nUnder our Bylaws, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, which means that the director nominees with the greatest\nnumber of votes cast will be elected. Each stockholder may, in respect of each share held, cast one vote with respect to each vacancy\non the Board. There is no cumulative voting for the election of directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines, each of the nominees has tendered an irrevocable resignation as a director, which resignation is conditioned\nupon both (A) such director failing to have received more “For” votes than “Withheld” votes in this election and (B) acceptance by the\nBoard of Directors of such resignation. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the nominees were required to tender the\nirrevocable resignations before the Board could nominate the nominees for re-election as director.\nIf, in an uncontested election such as this election, a director fails to receive more “For” votes than “Withheld” votes for\nelection, then, within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote, the Nominating and Governance Committee will act to\ndetermine whether to accept the director’s conditional resignation and will submit such recommendation for prompt consideration by\nthe Board, and the Board will act on the Nominating and Governance Committee’s recommendation. The Nominating and Governance\nCommittee and the Board may consider any factors they deem relevant in deciding whether to accept a director’s conditional resignation.\nHow many votes are needed to approve each of Proposals 2, 3 and 4?\nTo be approved, each of Proposals 2, 3 and 4 must receive a majority of the votes cast on the matter. If you “Abstain” from\nvoting, it will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Broker non-votes will also have no effect.\nWhat is the quorum requirement?\nA quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if stockholders holding at least a\nmajority of all of the shares of the stock entitled to vote at the meeting are present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. On the\nRecord Date, there were 56,877,055 shares outstanding and entitled to vote. Thus the holders of 28,438,528 shares must be present in\nperson or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting to have a quorum.\nYour shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your\nbroker, bank or other nominee) or if you attend the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the\nquorum requirement. If there is no quorum, the chair of the Annual Meeting or the holders of a majority of the shares present at the\nAnnual Meeting in person or represented by proxy may adjourn the Annual Meeting to another date.\nHow can I find out the results of the voting at the Annual Meeting?\nWe expect to announce the preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. In addition, final voting results will be published\nin a current report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If final voting\nresults are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K\nto publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known to us, file an amendment to the Form 8-K\nto publish the final results.\nWhat proxy materials are available on the internet?\nThe proxy statement and annual report to stockholders are available at: http://www.edocumentview.com/POWI.\n5\nPROPOSAL 1\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nThe Board is elected annually at the annual meeting of stockholders. Vacancies on the Board may be filled only by persons\nelected by a majority of the remaining directors. A director elected by the Board to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the year,\nand until the director’s successor is duly elected and qualified. This includes vacancies created by an increase in the number of directors.\nAs of March 29, 2024, the Board will have seven members, all of whose terms of office expire at the Annual Meeting. Proxies\nmay not be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named.\nEach of the nominees listed below is currently a director of Power Integrations who was previously elected by the stockholders.\nIf elected at the Annual Meeting, each of these nominees would be elected and qualified to serve until the 2025 annual meeting of\nstockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or, if sooner, until the director’s death, resignation or removal.\nIt is Power Integrations’ policy to encourage directors and director nominees to attend the Annual Meeting. All of the Company’s then\nnine directors attended the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders.\nAll elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast. Unless marked otherwise we will vote executed proxies\nreturned to us for the nominees named below. The seven nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected. If\na nominee receives more “Withheld” votes than “For” votes, then notwithstanding the election of that nominee, if the Board determines\nthat, based on the fact that the director received more “Withheld” votes than “For” votes, and the other facts it may deem relevant, the\nBoard may decide to accept the nominee’s conditional resignation previously submitted as required under our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines. See “How many votes are needed to elect directors?” in “Questions and Answers about These Proxy Materials and Voting”\nabove for a description of these guidelines. If any nominee becomes unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence,\nyour shares may be voted for the election of a substitute nominee proposed by Power Integrations. Each person nominated for election\nhas agreed to serve if elected. Power Integrations’ management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve.\nThis Proposal 1 is to elect the seven nominees as directors named herein. The biography of each of the nominees below contains\ninformation regarding such nominees as of March 22, 2024, including age, service as a director, business experience, director positions\nheld currently or at any time during the last five years, information regarding involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings,\nif applicable, and the experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills of each director, including those that led to the Nominating and\nGovernance Committee’s and the Board’s conclusion that each nominee should continue to serve as a director of Power Integrations.\nWendy Arienzo, Ph.D., age 68, has served as a director of Power Integrations since April 2017.

Each term used in the table has the meaning given to it in rule and related instructions.\nTotal Number of Directors: 7\nPart I: Gender Identity Female Male\nDirectors ................................................. 3 4\nPart II: Demographic Background\nAfrican American or Black .................................. ‒ 1\nAsian .................................................... 1 3\nWhite ................................................... 2 ‒\nIndependence of the Board\nAs required under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”), a majority of the members of our Board\nmust qualify as “independent,” as affirmatively determined by the Board. The Board consults with Power Integrations’ counsel to ensure\nthat the Board’s determinations are consistent with all relevant securities laws and other laws and regulations regarding the definition\nof “independent,” including those set forth in the applicable Nasdaq listing standards, as in effect from time to time.\nConsistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant identified transactions or relationships between each director,\nor any of his or her family members, and Power Integrations, its senior management and its independent registered public accounting\nfirm, the Board has affirmatively determined that all of the directors who served during 2023, other than Mr. Balakrishnan, our president\nand chief executive officer, are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. In making this\ndetermination, the Board found that none of the directors or nominees for director other than Mr. Balakrishnan had a material or other\ndisqualifying relationship with Power Integrations. Mr. Balakrishnan, by virtue of being Power Integrations’ president and chief\nexecutive officer, is not an independent director.\nInformation Regarding the Board and Its Committees\nThe Board has adopted the Corporate Governance Guidelines to help assure that the Board will have the necessary authority\nand practices in place to make decisions that are independent of Power Integrations’ management. The guidelines are also intended to\nalign the interests of directors and management with Power Integrations’ stockholders. The Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth\nthe practices the Board will follow with respect to, among other things, Board composition and selection, Board meetings, executive\nofficer succession planning, Board committees, compensation, director stock ownership and director education and orientation. The\nCorporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website: www.power.com.\nThe Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee.\n9\nThe following table provides membership information and meeting information for fiscal year 2023 for each of the Audit,\nCompensation and Nominating and Governance Committees:\nNominating and\nName Audit Compensation Governance\nWendy Arienzo ............................................................

Each of the committees has authority to engage legal counsel or other\nexperts or consultants, as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. The Board has determined that each member of each\ncommittee meets the applicable rules and regulations regarding “independence” and that each member is free of any relationship that\nwould interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment with regard to Power Integrations.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee oversees Power Integrations’ corporate accounting and financial reporting process. For this purpose, the\nAudit Committee performs several functions, including:\n• evaluates the performance of and assesses the qualifications of the independent registered public accounting firm;\n• determines and approves the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm;\n• determines whether to retain or terminate the existing independent registered public accounting firm or to appoint and\nengage a new independent registered public accounting firm;\n• reviews and approves the retention of the independent registered public accounting firm to perform any proposed\npermissible non-audit services;\n• monitors the rotation of partners of the independent registered public accounting firm on Power Integrations’ audit\nengagement team as required by law;\n• confers with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols over financial reporting;\n• establishes procedures, as required under applicable law, for the receipt, retention and treatment of whistleblower\ncomplaints received by Power Integrations regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and\nthe confidential and anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing\nmatters;\n• meets to review Power Integrations’ annual audited consolidated financial statements and quarterly financial\nstatements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm;\n• reviews and, if it determines appropriate, approves related person transactions;\n• reviews and discusses with management and, as appropriate, the independent auditor, the company’s major financial\nrisk exposures and the steps taken by management to monitor and control these exposures; and\n• adopts procedures for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, three directors compose the Audit Committee: Mr. Iyer, Mrs. Ganti and Mr. Vig. The\nBoard has adopted a written Audit Committee Charter which can be found on our website at www.power.com. The Audit Committee\nmet six times in 2023.\nThe Board annually reviews the Nasdaq listing standards definition of independence for Audit Committee members and has\ndetermined that all members of Power Integrations’ Audit Committee are independent (as independence is currently defined in\nRule 5605(c)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) of the Nasdaq listing standards). The Board has determined that each of Messrs. Iyer and Vig qualifies as\n10\nan “audit committee financial expert,” as defined in applicable SEC rules. The Board made a qualitative assessment of Messrs. Iyer’s\nand Vig’s level of knowledge and experience based upon their extensive experience, including as senior executive officers with financial\noversight functions.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee reviews and approves the overall compensation strategy and policies for Power Integrations.\nFor this purpose, the Compensation Committee performs several functions, including:\n• with respect to the chief executive officer, reviews and approves all compensation, including incentive-based\ncompensation and equity compensation awards while seeking to achieve an appropriate level of risk and reward, and\ndevelops and reviews annual performance objectives and goals relevant to compensation and awards and evaluates\nthe performance of the chief executive officer in light of these goals and objectives;\n• reviews incentive-based compensation plans in which our executive officers participate, and determines the salaries,\nincentive and equity compensation for executive officers, and oversees the evaluation of management;\n• approves all employment, severance, or change-in-control agreements, special or supplemental benefits, or provisions\nincluding the same, applicable to executive officers;\n• proposes the adoption, amendment, and termination of stock option plans, stock appreciation rights plans, retirement\nand profit-sharing plans, stock bonus plans, stock purchase plans, bonus plans, deferred compensation plans, and other\nsimilar programs;\n• grants rights, participation and interests in our compensation plans to eligible participants;\n• approves and periodically reviews the salary, bonus and equity award ranges for non-executive officers and other\nemployees, and authorizes the chief executive officer to approve compensation levels for such non-executive officers\nand other employees within such ranges;\n• reviews and approves such other compensation matters as the Board or the chief executive officer wishes to have the\nCompensation Committee approve;\n• reviews and recommends to the Board the compensation to be paid to our non-employee directors for their service on\nthe Board and its committees and any changes thereto, other than compensation received pursuant to automatic equity\naward grants under stockholder approved equity compensation plans;\n• reviews with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (included in this proxy statement) and considers\nwhether to recommend that it be included in proxy statements and other filings;\n• reviews and evaluates the results of advisory votes of the company’s stockholders regarding executive compensation;\nand\n• reviews with the chief executive officer the plans for succession to the offices of Power Integrations’ executive officers\nand makes recommendations to be considered by the Board with respect to the selection of appropriate individuals to\nsucceed to those positions.\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, three directors compose the Compensation Committee: Dr. Arienzo, Mr. Brathwaite and\nMs. Gioia. All members of the Compensation Committee are independent (as independence is currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of\nthe Nasdaq listing standards). The Board has adopted a written Compensation Committee Charter, which can be found on our website\nat www.power.com. The Compensation Committee met six times in 2023.\nCompensation Committee Processes and Procedures\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board determines all compensation for our executive officers, including our chief\nexecutive officer. The Compensation Committee also administers our compensation plans, including equity incentive plans, and makes\nrecommendations to the Board regarding the adoption, amendment, and termination of these compensation plans. The Compensation\nCommittee also analyzes, considers and recommends to the Board the compensation to be paid to our non-employee directors for their\nservice on the Board and its committees, other than compensation received pursuant to automatic equity award grants under stockholder-\napproved equity compensation plans.\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to obtain advice or assistance from consultants, legal counsel, accounting or\nother advisors as appropriate, to perform its duties, and to determine the terms, costs and fees for such engagements, which are paid for\nby Power Integrations. The Compensation Committee also has full access to all books, records, facilities and personnel of Power\nIntegrations. The Compensation Committee may from time to time delegate duties or responsibilities to subcommittees or to one member\nof the Compensation Committee.\n11\nThe Compensation Committee meets as often as it deems appropriate, but not less frequently than once each year to review the\ncompensation and awards of the executive officers and other employees of Power Integrations, and otherwise perform its duties under\nits charter.\nOur chief executive officer, Mr. Balakrishnan, reviews with the Compensation Committee on a regular basis our compensation\nphilosophy and programs, including the compensation of the named executive officers, so that the Compensation Committee can\nrecommend any changes necessary to keep our compensation philosophy and programs aligned with our business objectives.\nMr. Balakrishnan makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation of the named executive\nofficers. The Compensation Committee also utilizes an outside compensation consultant to provide it with advice on competitive\ncompensation plans. The Compensation Committee considers, but is not bound to and does not always accept, management’s or the\noutside consultant’s recommendations with respect to executive compensation. The Compensation Committee discusses\nMr. Balakrishnan’s compensation with him, but deliberates and makes decisions with respect to Mr. Balakrishnan’s compensation\nwithout him present.\nMr. Balakrishnan attends some of the Compensation Committee’s meetings, but leaves the meetings as appropriate when\nmatters of executive compensation specific to him are discussed.\nFor 2023, the Compensation Committee engaged an independent compensation consulting firm, Radford, part of the Rewards\nand Solutions practice at Aon plc (“Aon”), to assist in the analysis of compensation survey data. Aon attended Compensation Committee\nmeetings from time to time and provided peer group analysis, feedback and recommendations to the Compensation Committee on\nexecutive compensation and director compensation. Aon was instructed to review compensation at peer companies for the named\nexecutive officers and the company’s directors, and to give comments and recommendations based on that review. Aon was also\nexpected to use its experience with the company and other similar companies and to apply judgment based on that experience. In addition\nto survey data, the Compensation Committee analyzes information reported in peer companies’ SEC filings for all elements of\ncompensation, including salary, cash incentive compensation and equity compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews on at\nleast an annual basis the six factors required by Nasdaq to be reviewed by the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation\nconsultant prior to receiving advice from the compensation consultant.\nSubject to business needs, the Compensation Committee’s policy is to grant restricted stock units (“RSUs”), to certain new\nemployees on the first trading day of the month following the date of hire. In addition, we make grants of annual performance stock\nunits (“PSUs”) and RSUs to continuing non-executive employees generally on the first day the company’s common stock trades on the\nNasdaq Global Select Market in April of such year, and the Compensation Committee makes grants to executive officers on the date of\nCompensation Committee action with respect to PSUs and RSUs.\nThe Board determines outside director compensation, after receiving the recommendations from the Compensation Committee\nand the same independent consultant engaged by the Compensation Committee and used by the Compensation Committee in connection\nwith determining executive officer compensation.\nA further description of the Compensation Committee processes and procedures and the specific determinations of the\nCompensation Committee with respect to executive compensation for fiscal year 2023 are described in greater detail in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.\nNominating and Governance Committee\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for recommending the nomination of directors to the Board and for\nestablishing and monitoring our corporate governance. For this purpose, the Nominating and Governance Committee performs several\nfunctions, including:\n• evaluates and recommends to the Board director nominees for each election of directors;\n• determines criteria for selecting new directors, including desired board skills and attributes, and identifies and actively\nseeks individuals qualified to become directors;\n• reviews and makes recommendations to the Board concerning qualifications and the appointment and removal of\ncommittee members;\n• develops, recommends for Board approval, and reviews on an ongoing basis the adequacy of Power Integrations’\ncorporate governance principles;\n• reviews, discusses and assesses the performance of the Board, including Board committees; and\n• considers Board nominees and proposals submitted by stockholders or proposals to be submitted by the company to\nthe company’s stockholders regarding corporate governance matters and makes recommendations to the Board\nregarding such matters, and establishes any policies, processes and procedures, including procedures to facilitate\nstockholder communication with the Board.\n12\nThe Board has adopted a written Nominating and Governance Committee Charter, which can be found on our website at\nwww.power.com. As of the date of this proxy statement, three directors compose the Nominating and Governance Committee:\nMessrs. Brathwaite and Iyer and Dr. Arienzo. The Nominating and Governance Committee met five times in 2023. All members of the\nNominating and Governance Committee are independent (as independence is currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq listing\nstandards).\nIn considering whether to recommend any candidates for inclusion in the Board’s slate of recommended director nominees,\nincluding candidates recommended by stockholders, the Nominating and Governance Committee applies the criteria set forth in Power\nIntegrations’ Corporate Governance Guidelines. These criteria include the candidate’s ability to read and understand financial\nstatements, age, personal integrity and ethics, relevant expertise upon which to be able to offer advice and guidance to management,\nhaving sufficient time to devote to the affairs of the company, demonstrated experience in his or her field, ability to exercise sound\nbusiness judgment, and having the commitment to rigorously represent the long-term interests of the company’s stockholders. In\naddition, when conducting its assessment, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers any criteria for director qualifications\nset by the Board, as well as diversity, skills, and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the current needs of the Board and the\ncompany to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. When considering diversity, the Board and Nominating and\nGovernance Committee views “diversity” as diversity of experience and expertise. The Board and Nominating and Governance\nCommittee believe that having a Board diverse in experience and expertise enables the Board, as a body, to have the broad range of\nrequisite expertise and experience to guide the company and management and to fulfill its role of oversight and stewardship. However,\nneither the Board nor the Nominating and Governance Committee has developed a policy with respect to diversity in identifying\nnominees for director, other than as set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines to consider diversity when assessing nominees.\nIn the case of incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire, the Nominating and Governance Committee reviews\nsuch directors’ overall service to the company during their term, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation,\nquality of performance, and any other relationships and transactions that might impair such directors’ independence. In the case of new\ndirector candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee also determines whether the nominee should be independent for Nasdaq\npurposes, which determination is based upon applicable Nasdaq listing standards, applicable SEC rules and regulations and the advice\nof counsel, if necessary. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no\nparticular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee then uses its\nnetwork of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, but may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee conducts any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications\nof possible candidates after considering the function and needs of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee meets to\ndiscuss and consider such candidates’ qualifications and then recommends a nominee to the Board by majority vote.\nTo date, the Nominating and Governance Committee has not paid a fee to any third party to assist in the process of identifying\nor evaluating director candidates. To date, the Nominating and Governance Committee has not received a timely recommended director\nnominee from a stockholder or stockholders holding more than 5% of our voting stock.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders who demonstrate,\nby written documentation, satisfactory to the Nominating and Governance Committee, that such stockholders hold outstanding shares\nof the company. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not intend to alter the manner in which it evaluates candidates,\nincluding the minimum criteria set forth above, based on whether the candidate was recommended by a stockholder or not. Stockholders\nwho wish to recommend individuals for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee to become nominees for election\nto the Board in 2025 may do so by delivering a written recommendation to the Nominating and Governance Committee at the following\naddress: 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002 by November 29, 2024. Submissions must include the full name of the\nproposed nominee, a description of the proposed nominee’s business experience for at least the previous five years, complete\nbiographical information, and a description of the proposed nominee’s qualifications as a director. Any such submission must be\naccompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nAs set forth in Power Integrations’ Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board’s leadership structure shall be either (a) a\nseparate Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, or (b) a Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer who is the\nsame person, together with a Lead Independent Director. The Nominating and Governance Committee determined that either of these\nstructures is appropriate for Power Integrations as each provides for an independent director to take the functional role where it is\nappropriate for an independent director to fulfill that function. Currently, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are\nthe same person and separate from the Lead Independent Director.\nAt this time, the Board believes that our CEO is best situated to serve as Chairman of the Board. Balu Balakrishnan is highly\nknowledgeable and has longstanding experience with respect to our business, operations and industry and ongoing executive\nresponsibility for the Company. As such, he is well positioned to identify strategic priorities and lead the Board’s consideration and\n13\nanalysis of such priorities. In addition, he offers a robust understanding of risks facing the Company. In the Board's view, this enables\nthe Board to better understand the Company and work with management to enhance stockholder value. In addition, the Board believes\nthat this structure enables it to better fulfill its risk oversight responsibilities and enhances the ability of the CEO to effectively\ncommunicate the Board's view to management.\nConcurrent with Mr. Balakrishnan’s appointment as Chairman of the Board in 2023, the Board appointed Mr. Balakrishan S.\nIyer as the lead independent director to help reinforce the independence of the Board as a whole. The position of lead independent\ndirector has been structured to serve as an effective balance to a combined CEO/Chairman of the Board. The lead independent director\nis empowered to, among other duties and responsibilities, preside over Board meetings, act as liaison between the Chairman of the Board\nand the independent directors, preside over meetings of the independent directors, and consult with the Chairman of the Board in\nplanning and setting schedules and agendas for Board meetings. As a result, we believe that the lead independent director can help\nensure the effective independent functioning of the Board in its oversight responsibilities. In addition, we believe that the lead\nindependent director is better positioned to build a consensus among directors and to serve as a conduit between the other independent\ndirectors and the Chairman of the Board, for example, by facilitating the inclusion on meeting agendas of matters of concern to the\nindependent directors. In light of Mr. Iyer’s extensive history with and knowledge of the Company, and because the Board’s lead\nindependent director is empowered to play a significant role in the Board’s leadership and in reinforcing the independence of the Board,\nwe believe that the Company has a balanced and effective Board governance structure.\nRole of the Board in Risk Oversight\nThe Board has an active role, as a whole and at the committee level, in overseeing management of the company’s risks. The\nBoard regularly reviews information regarding the Company’s credit, liquidity, operations, information technology (“IT”) and\ncybersecurity practices as well as the risks associated with each. The Audit Committee charter specifies that the committee shall review\nand discuss with management, and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm as appropriate, the Company’s major\nfinancial risk exposures and the steps taken by management to monitor and control these exposures. The Compensation Committee is\nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company’s executive compensation plans and arrangements. The\nNominating and Governance Committee manages risks associated with the independence of the Board and potential conflicts of interest.\nWhile each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the Board is regularly\ninformed through committee reports about such risks. The full Board actively oversees the Company’s IT and cybersecurity policies,\nprocedures and risk assessments, and management reports to the Board on information security matters on a quarterly basis, or more\nfrequently as needed. We partner with third parties to help support our cybersecurity systems and maintain an awareness of current best\npractices, and we deliver quarterly cybersecurity awareness training to all employees.\nCompensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management\nWith the help of the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consulting firm, Aon, the Compensation\nCommittee has reviewed the Company’s compensation policies and practices as they relate to risk management for all employees,\nincluding executive officers. The compensation policies and practices reviewed by the Compensation Committee included: (1) annual\nbase salaries; (2) the annual and long-term performance-based incentive award plans; (3) equity incentive awards under the 2016\nIncentive Award Plan; (4) the Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and (5) the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements. Following such\nreview, the Compensation Committee determined that risks arising from the Company’s compensation policies and practices for its\nemployees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In coming to this conclusion, the Compensation\nCommittee also considered the mitigating effects of the Company’s compensation “claw-back” policy which requires the “claw-back”\nof incentive compensation paid to current and former executive officers when that compensation is based upon achievement of financial\nresults that later require a financial accounting restatement.\nMeetings of the Board\nThe Board met six times in 2023. All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of the meetings of the Board and\nthe committees on which they served, held during the portion of the last fiscal year for which they were directors or committee members\nin 2023.\nAs required under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, in fiscal year 2023, Power Integrations’ independent directors met in\nregularly scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors were present.\nStockholder Communications with the Board\nThe Board has adopted a formal process by which stockholders may communicate with the Board or any of its directors.\nStockholders who wish to communicate with the Board may do so by sending written communications addressed as follows: Power\nIntegrations Board Communication, 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002. Any communication sent must state the\nnumber of shares owned by the stockholder making the communication. The communications will be reviewed by the Chairman of the\n14\nBoard. The Chairman of the Board will forward such communication to the Board or to any individual director to whom the\ncommunication is addressed unless the communication is unduly frivolous, hostile, threatening or similarly inappropriate, in which case,\nthe Chairman of the Board shall discard the communication.\nSustainability, Corporate Responsibility and Business Ethics\nThe average home contains dozens of devices that spend the vast majority of their time in standby or no-load conditions. Due\nmainly to inefficient power supplies, the energy wasted by these devices adds up to a massive burden on our economy and our\nenvironment. A 2015 study1 found that in an average U.S. home, products in standby or other idle conditions consumed approximately\n$165 worth of electricity per year. Nationwide, this added up to an amount of power equivalent to the production of 50 large power\nplants. Our EcoSmart technology drastically reduces the amount of power wasted by electronic products when they are plugged in but\nnot in use. We estimate that in 2023 this technology saved approximately 15 terawatt-hours of electricity, an amount equal to the entire\nannual consumption of about two million homes.2 In addition to these standby savings, the highly efficient silicon and gallium-nitride\ntransistors incorporated in our integrated circuits also enable highly efficient “active-mode” operation of electronic products. We believe\nour BridgeSwitch™ motor-driver products offer the highest efficiency available for powering brushless direct current (“DC”) motors\nused in many home-appliance applications, while our SCALE gate-drivers are used in a variety of clean technologies such as solar and\nwind energy systems, high-voltage DC transmission lines and electric transportation.\nAs a producer of technologies and products that generate significant environmental benefits, we understand that there is\neconomic opportunity in operating with the good of society and the environment in mind. We take a long-term approach to planning\nand decision making, and invest for sustainable growth and profitability. We foster stable, long-term relationships with manufacturing\npartners holding ISO quality and environmental certifications. We value our employees, giving them the tools and training to grow as\nindividuals, and the freedom to take risks in the service of innovation. Despite a challenging fiscal year 2023, requiring that we prudently\nmanage expenses, we gave normal annual salary increases and continued to hire, contributing to a below average employee turnover\nrelative to our industry. As a result of our long-term, sustainable approach, we have a track record of positive earnings, high levels of\ncustomer satisfaction and below-average employee turnover relative to our industry.\nAs a fabless semiconductor company, we regard our manufacturing partners as an extension of our operations. We have a\nrigorous qualification process and choose only established wafer foundries and assembly-and-test sub-contractors who are ISO 14001\ncertified for environmental compliance and IATF 16949 certified for quality management. All of our foundry partners have roadmaps\nto deliver substantial reductions in GHG/CO2 emissions. We expect our manufacturing partners to subscribe to our Supplier Code of\nConduct and regularly audit our suppliers to ensure compliance. As a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, we are committed\nto ensuring that all of our products containing cobalt, tungsten, gold, tantalum and tin are conflict-free or sourced from compliant\nsmelters and refiners.\nWe operate a 600-kilowatt solar array at our San Jose headquarters, which generates enough power to effectively take one of\nour three buildings off the grid and to power our parking lot lights. Among the ten largest commercial solar installations in Silicon\nValley at the time of its completion, the system is expected to prevent more than 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions over 25 years. In 2023,\nwe undertook an expansion of the solar array at our headquarters which when completed, will add more than a megawatt of additional\ngenerating capacity along with nearly a hundred new electric-vehicle charging stations. In 2022, we opened a new facility in Biel,\nSwitzerland featuring a 25-kilowatt solar array. In 2021, we installed 43 kilowatts of solar capacity at our facility in Ense, Germany.\nWe have a skilled and diverse workforce, and we offer competitive compensation including generous benefits, paying an above-\naverage percentage of the cost of employees’ health, dental and vision insurance. We offer flexible spending accounts for healthcare\nand child-care expenses, matching 401(k) contributions, an employee stock purchase plan, paid vacation and family leave, life and\ndisability insurance, flu vaccinations, tuition reimbursement, health-and-wellness programs designed to promote physical well-being\nand other mental health services. We encourage employee skill growth by offering tuition reimbursement of up to $5,250 each year for\njob related education. We offer workshops on a range of personal development topics such as financial planning, nutrition and stress\nmanagement. We also support employees’ charitable giving by matching up to $750 of donations per employee per year.\nAdditional information, including workforce diversity and injury data, quantitative reporting on energy usage and the energy\nsavings enabled by our products, and the reports and policies listed below, can be found at the “Sustainability and Citizenship” section\nof our corporate website, www.power.com/company/sustainability-and-citizenship:\n• Supplier Code of Conduct\n• Human Rights Policy\n• Conflict Minerals Report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n1 National Resources Defense Council, May 2015 (https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/home-idle-load-IP.pdf)\n2 U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator\n15\n• Conflict Minerals Policy Statement\n• UK Modern Slavery Act Statement\n• Environment, Health and Safety Policy\n• RoHS/REACH Compliant and Halogen Free Statement\n• Certification of REACH SVHC Non-Usage\n• Environmental, Health and Safety Policy\n• Injury and Illness Prevention Program\n• Whistleblower Policy\n• Non-discrimination Policy\nPower Integrations has adopted the Power Integrations, Inc. Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all officers,\ndirectors and employees. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be found on our website, www.power.com, and is available in\nprint to any stockholder who requests it. Requests for printed copies of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be made by writing\nto Attn: Investor Relations Department, Power Integrations, Inc., 5245 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, California 95138-1002.

At its\ndiscretion, the Board may evaluate whether this requirement should be waived in the case of any director, who, because of his or her\npersonal circumstances, would incur a hardship by complying with this requirement. Currently all members of the Board comply with\nthe guidelines.\nChief Executive Officer Stock-Ownership Guidelines\nPursuant to Power Integrations’ Corporate Governance Guidelines and to align the interests of our chief executive officer with\nthe interests of the Company’s stockholders, the Board believes that the chief executive officer should have a significant financial stake\nin the Company. Accordingly, the Board believes that our chief executive officer, upon reaching three years of service in this role\n(excluding service prior to the date of the chief executive officer stock ownership guidelines) should own an aggregate number of shares\nof our common stock with a value equal to or exceeding three times the chief executive officer’s annual base salary. At its discretion,\nthe Board may evaluate whether this requirement should be waived in the case of the chief executive officer, who, because of his or her\npersonal circumstances, would incur a hardship by complying with this requirement, including as a result of a decrease in the value of\nour common stock.\nAs of March 22, 2024, Mr. Balakrishnan owned outright 419,360 shares of our common stock (including shares owned through\nhis personal trust), with a value of approximately $29.4 million.\nExecutive Officer Stock Ownership\nAlthough we do not have minimum mandatory stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers other than our chief\nexecutive officer, the structure of our compensation programs acts as a functional equivalent of minimum stock ownership requirements,\nas our executive officers: (1) hold unvested RSUs, which entitle the executive officers to receive shares of our common stock in the\nfuture upon vesting (unvested RSUs as of March 22, 2024, for the Company’s named executive officers were as follows: 92,300 shares\nfor Mr. Balakrishnan; 36,375 shares for Mr. Nayyar; 26,975 shares for Mr. Barsan; 21,629 shares for Mr. Gupta; and 19,499 shares for\nMr. Yee); and (2) hold unvested PSUs and PRSUs, which entitle the executive officer to receive shares of our common stock in the\nfuture upon vesting which occurs upon achieving established performance metrics (currently collectively 148,800 shares for\nMr. Balakrishnan; 26,000 shares for Mr. Nayyar; 18,400 shares for Mr. Barsan; 15,000 shares for Mr. Gupta; and 12,200 shares for Mr.\nYee).\nMinimum Vesting Periods for Executive Officer Equity Grants\nAlthough we do not have minimum mandatory vesting periods for equity grants made to our executive officers, our historical\npractice, which our Compensation Committee intends to continue in the future, is to have vesting periods on our equity grants typically\nas follows: (1) for RSUs, vesting over four years with 25% of the shares subject to the RSU vesting on each of the first four anniversaries\n16\nof the date of grant; (2) for PSUs, vesting after one year, but only to the extent that the performance metrics for the PSUs are met; and\n(3) for PRSUs vesting after three years, but only to the extent that the performance metrics for the PRSUs are met.\nMinimum Vesting Periods for Director Equity Grants\nNon-employee directors each receive an annual equity compensation grant, which consists of RSUs that vest in full effective\nimmediately prior to the commencement of the Company’s first annual meeting of stockholders in the year following the year of the\nannual grant, provided that the recipient is still providing services to the Company as a director. A new eligible director generally\nreceives a similar grant pro-rated to the remaining portion of the year prior to the next annual grants of equity awards to non-employee\ndirectors.\nProhibition on Hedging\nOur Board has adopted a policy that prohibits directors, executive officers and other insiders (as defined in such policy) from\nengaging in short sales, transactions in put or call options, hedging transactions or other inherently speculative transactions with respect\nto our common stock at any time.\n17\nPROPOSAL 2\nADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and Section 14A of the Exchange\nAct, Power Integrations’ stockholders are entitled to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named\nexecutive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules. This vote is not intended to address any specific\nitem of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the Company’s named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and\npractices described in this proxy statement.\nThe compensation of the Company’s named executive officers subject to the vote is disclosed in the Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis, the compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure contained in this proxy statement. As discussed in those\ndisclosures, the company believes that its compensation policies and decisions are focused on pay-for-performance principles, strongly\naligned with our stockholders’ interests and consistent with current market practices. Compensation of the Company’s named executive\nofficers is designed to enable the Company to attract and retain talented and experienced executives to lead the company successfully\nin a competitive environment.\nOur executive compensation program has been designed to retain and encourage a talented, motivated and focused executive\nteam by providing competitive compensation within our market. We believe that our executive compensation program provides an\nappropriate balance between salary and “at-risk” forms of variable incentive compensation, as well as a mix of incentives that encourage\nexecutive focus on both short- and long-term goals as a company without encouraging inappropriate risks to achieve performance.\nHighlights of our program include:\n• A mixture of salary and variable incentive compensation that provides for a substantial portion of executive\ncompensation to be “at-risk” and dependent on our performance as a company which aligns the interests of executive\nofficers with those of the company’s stockholders;\n• Long-term, equity-based incentive compensation to align the interests of executive officers with stockholders and to\nprovide each executive officer with an incentive to manage the company from the perspective of an owner with an\nequity stake in the business; and\n• A compensation “claw-back” policy which conditions the earning and payment of any cash or stock bonuses to\nexecutive officers on an agreement to repay a portion of such bonuses in the event of a financial accounting\nrestatement.\nAccordingly, the Board is asking the stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of the Company’s named\nexecutive officers as described in this proxy statement by casting a non-binding advisory vote “FOR” the following resolution:\n“RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Power Integrations’ named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy\nstatement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and\nnarrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”\nBecause the vote is advisory, it is not binding on the Board or the Company. Nevertheless, the views expressed by the\nstockholders, whether through this vote or otherwise, are important to management and the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the\nCompensation Committee intend to consider the results of this vote in making determinations regarding executive compensation\narrangements in the future.\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS\nA VOTE IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 2\n18\nPROPOSAL 3\nRATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as Power Integrations’ independent registered public accounting\nfirm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The Board has directed that management submit the selection of Deloitte & Touche\nLLP as Power Integrations’ independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting. In\ndetermining whether to reappoint the independent auditor, the Audit Committee takes into consideration various factors, including the\nauditor’s historical and recent performance on the audit; the length of time the firm has served in this role; professional qualifications;\nthe quality of ongoing discussions with the auditor; external data, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board reports\non the auditor and its peer firms; and the appropriateness of fees.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP has audited Power Integrations’ financial statements since 2005. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche\nLLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be\navailable to respond to appropriate questions.\nNeither Power Integrations’ Bylaws nor other governing documents or law requires stockholder ratification of the selection of\nDeloitte & Touche LLP as Power Integrations’ independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Board is submitting the\nselection of Deloitte & Touche LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to\nratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit\nCommittee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during\nthe year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Power Integrations and its stockholders.\nPrincipal Accountant Fees and Services\nThe following table represents aggregate fees billed to Power Integrations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 by Deloitte & Touche LLP, Power Integrations’ independent registered public accounting firm.\nFiscal Fiscal\n(in thousands) 2023 2022\nAudit Fees(1) ....................................................................... $ 1,515 $ 1,485\nAudit-Related Fees .................................................................. — —\nTax Fees(2) ......................................................................... 164 170\nAll Other Fees ...................................................................... — —\nTotal Fees ......................................................................... $ 1,679 $ 1,655\n(1) Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our consolidated annual financial statements\nand review of the interim consolidated financial statements included in quarterly reports and services that are normally provided\nby Deloitte & Touche LLP in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. Audit fees for 2023 and 2022\ninclude fees for professional services rendered for the audits of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\n(2) In 2023 and 2022, tax fees related primarily to tax planning and tax compliance advice.\nAll fees described above were approved by the Audit Committee.\nPre-Approval Policy and Procedures\nThe Audit Committee has a policy to approve in advance the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm\nfor all audit services and non-audit services, based on independence, qualifications and, if applicable, performance, and approve the fees\nand other terms of any such engagement; provided, however, that the Audit Committee may establish pre-approval policies and\nprocedures for any engagement to render such services, provided that such policies and procedures (a) are detailed as to particular\nservices, (b) do not involve delegation to management of the Audit Committee’s responsibilities, and (c) provide that, at its next\nscheduled meeting, the Audit Committee is informed as to each such service for which the independent auditor is engaged pursuant to\nsuch policies and procedures. In addition, the Audit Committee may delegate to one or more members of the committee the authority to\ngrant pre-approvals for such audit and non-audit services, provided that (1) the decisions of such member(s) to grant any such pre-\napproval shall be presented to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting and (2) the Audit Committee has established policies\nand procedures for such pre-approval of services consistent with the requirements of clauses (a) and (b) above.\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS\nA VOTE IN FAVOR OF PROPOSAL 3\n19\nPROPOSAL 4\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE\nJohn Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, who holds 50 shares of our common stock,\nwhich he has held for more than three years, intends to submit the proposal as set forth below for consideration at the Annual Meeting. The\nCompany is not responsible for the contents of the proposal. If properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the Board is not making any\nrecommendation regarding this proposal.\nProposal 4 – Simple Majority Vote\nShareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws (that is explicit\nor implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes\ncast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. If necessary this means the closest standard\nto a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with the applicable laws. This includes making the necessary changes\nin plain English.\nShareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting\nrequirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to “What\nMatters in Corporate Governance” by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements\nare used to block initiatives supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management.\nThis proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy,\nMcGraw-Hill and Macy’s. These votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting\nadvice. This proposal topic also received overwhelming 98%-support each at the 2023 annual meetings of American Airlines (AAL) and The\nCarlyle Group (CG).\nThe overwhelming shareholder support for this proposal topic at hundreds of major companies raises the question of why Power\nIntegrations had not initiated this proposal topic earlier.\nPlease vote yes:\nSimple Majority Vote – Proposal 4\nBoard of Directors’ Response\nThe Board has considered the proposal set forth above relating to the removal of supermajority voting standards in our restated\ncertificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and has determined to make no voting recommendation to our stockholders.\nThe proposal is advisory in nature only. Stockholders should note that approval of this proposal would not, by itself, implement a\nmajority voting standard as described in the proposal, and the Board and our stockholders would need to take subsequent action to\namend our restated certificate of incorporation and/or our amended and restated bylaws.\nThe proposal asks that we amend any provisions in our charter and bylaws which require more than a simple majority vote to\ninstead require only a simple majority vote. The default voting standard for stockholder action under our governing documents is a\nmajority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote. However, as permitted by Delaware law, our governing documents\nspecify supermajority voting standards applicable only to certain extraordinary transactions and fundamental changes in corporate\ngovernance. For example, the only supermajority provisions included in our governing documents are:\n• Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Article Seventh. Requiring the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting\npower of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company to amend the amended and restated bylaws when\npresented for stockholder approval.\n20\n• Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Article Ninth. Requiring the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting\npower of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company to amend the following provisions of the restated\ncertificate of incorporation:\no Article Fifth.\n change the method by which any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders must be effected,\nincluding the method by which directors shall be elected and hold office until the next Annual Meeting\n(Article Fifth, Sections A-C);\n change the method by which special meetings of stockholders of the Company may be called (Article Fifth,\nSection D);\no Article Sixth.\n change the number of directors that constitute the Board (Article Sixth, section A);\n change the method by which vacancies resulting from death, resignation, disqualification, removal, or other\ncause can be filled on the Board (Article Sixth, Sections B and C);\no Article Seventh.\n amend the provision which provides for the method for the Board and stockholders to amend the amended\nand restated bylaws;\no Article Eighth.\n amend the provision that provides when a director shall be personally liable to the Company or its\nstockholders for breaches of fiduciary duty;\no Article Ninth. Amend the provision which provides for the method to amend the restated certificate of incorporation;\nand\n• Amended and Restated Bylaws, Article IX. Requiring the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the\noutstanding shares of capital stock of the Company to amend the amended and restated bylaws when presented for stockholder\napproval.\nThe Board adopted these limited supermajority voting requirements to ensure that there is broad support for any extraordinary\ntransactions or fundamental changes to corporate governance affecting all stockholders. Under the proposed voting standard, only a\nmajority of the votes actually cast for or against a proposal at any annual or special meeting is required; consequently, a few large\nstockholders could approve certain key actions and significantly alter our governance structure. For example, in the event of a meeting\nin which only 50% plus one share of our outstanding shares of capital stock were present and entitled to vote a stockholder meeting (the\nminimum number to constitute a quorum), holders of 25% plus one share of our outstanding capital stock could approve changes to our\ncorporate governance structure. Such a circumstance would be avoided by maintaining the current, limited supermajority voting\nstandards.\nThe Board further notes that as of March 22, 2024, the shareholder proponent of this proposal owned approximately 50 shares\nof the Company’s common stock out of more than 56.9 million shares outstanding. Nevertheless, the Board is interested in the viewpoints\nof the Company’s stockholders and will evaluate the voting results on Proposal No. 4, together with additional stockholder input received\nin the course of the Company’s regular stockholder engagement program, in determining what actions it will take.\nAccordingly, the Board has elected not to make a recommendation with respect to this proposal.\nTHE BOARD IS NOT MAKING ANY RECOMMENDATION REGARDING PROPOSAL 4\n21\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD*\nDuring 2023, four independent, non-employee directors served on the Audit Committee: Mr. Iyer, Mrs. Ganti, Dr. Sayiner and\nMr. Vig. Dr. Sayiner retired from service on the company’s Board of directors on May 19, 2023. Following Dr. Sayiner’s retirement,\nthree directors composed the Audit Committee: Mr. Iyer, Mrs. Ganti and Mr. Vig. The Committee operates under a written charter\nadopted by the Board, which can be found on our website at www.power.com.\nThe Audit Committee, the Company’s management and the independent registered public accounting firm (Deloitte & Touche\nLLP) have specific but different responsibilities relating to Power Integrations’ financial reporting. Management is responsible for Power\nIntegrations’ internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for\nauditing the Company’s financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls. The Audit Committee’s\nresponsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.\nThe Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of any independent\nauditor (including resolution of disagreements between management and the auditor regarding financial reporting) engaged by the\ncompany for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work. The Audit Committee consults with the independent\nauditor to assure partner rotation at least every five years, as required by applicable rules, and in order to assure continuing auditor\nindependence. The Audit Committee annually evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of the auditor. The evaluation\nincludes reviewing the auditor’s quality-control procedures and a review of the lead audit partner, taking into consideration the opinions\nof management and the Company’s internal auditors. The results of the evaluation are reported to the Board together with any\nrecommendations for necessary actions.\nThe Audit Committee meets with the auditor periodically throughout the year to discuss the planning and staffing of the annual\naudit. The Audit Committee also meets with both management and the auditor to discuss the results of the annual audit, including the\nauditor’s assessment of the quality, not just acceptability, of accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and\nestimates, the adequacy of the financial statement disclosures and any other matters required to be communicated to the Committee\nunder the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”).\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023, with management and Deloitte & Touche LLP. The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche\nLLP the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. The Audit Committee has also received the\nwritten disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the\nindependent accountants’ communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent\nregistered public accounting firm the accounting firm’s independence.\nBased on its discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee has\nrecommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Power Integrations’ Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\nBalakrishnan S.

The maximum number of shares subject to purchase rights under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan is a\nfunction of stock price and total employee contributions. As such we cannot reasonably determine the number of shares subject\nto outstanding purchase rights as of December 31, 2023.\n(3) On July 28, 2009, this plan was amended to generally prohibit outstanding options or stock appreciation rights from being\ncanceled in exchange for cash without stockholder approval and already prohibited the repricing of any outstanding stock\nawards and the canceling and re-granting of any outstanding stock awards without stockholder approval.\n25\nDELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10%\nof our common stock to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. These persons are required\nby SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.\nTo our knowledge, based solely on our review of electronic filings with the SEC of such reports and written representations\nfrom our executive officers and directors that no other reports were required during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we believe\nthat all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than\n10% of our common stock were complied with in 2023.\n26\nCOMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS\nCash Compensation. Pursuant to our cash compensation policy, each of our directors, with the exception of Mr. Balakrishnan,\nreceives $11,250 per quarter to serve as a member of the Board, and the chairman of the Board, or Lead Independent Director when the\nchairman of the Board is an employee of our company, receives an additional $7,500 per quarter to serve in such capacity. Our non-\nemployee directors do not receive per-meeting fees.\nIn addition, the chairs of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee, receive\n$5,000, $3,750 and $2,500 per quarter, respectively. Non-chair members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and\nNominating and Governance Committee receive $2,500, $2,000 and $1,250 per quarter, respectively, to serve on these committees.\nNon-employee directors are reimbursed for all reasonable travel and related expenses incurred in connection with attending\nBoard and committee meetings.\nEquity Awards. Additionally, directors who are not employees of Power Integrations each receive equity compensation.\nInitial and annual equity incentive grants are made to non-employee directors primarily under the Power Integrations 2016\nIncentive Award Plan (the “2016 Plan”) as follows (the “Directors Equity Compensation Program”):\n• On the first trading day of July in each year (the “Regular Grant Date”), each continuing eligible director will receive\na grant of an equity award in the form RSUs under the 2016 Plan with an aggregate value of $120,000 (the “Equity\nAward”). Each such Equity Award would vest in full effective immediately prior to the commencement of the\nCompany’s first annual meeting of stockholders in the year following the year of the Regular Grant Date, provided\nthat the recipient is still providing services to the Company as a director and provided further, that 100% of the shares\nsubject to such Equity Award would be deemed fully vested upon the occurrence of a “Change of Control,” as such\nterm is defined in the 2016 Plan;\n• A new eligible director generally would receive an Equity Award consisting of RSUs equal to the prorated portion of\nthe Company’s annual Equity Awards based on the time between the date the new director is appointed to the Board\nand the first trading day of Nasdaq in the month of July following such director’s appointment; and\n• The Directors Equity Compensation Program will remain in effect at the discretion of the Board or the Compensation\nCommittee.\nMr. Balakrishnan, our chief executive officer and president, was not compensated for his services as Chairman and member of\nthe Board.\nThe following table shows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 certain information with respect to the compensation\nof all non-employee directors of Power Integrations:\nDirector Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023\nFees Earned or R estricted Stock\nName Paid in Cash(1) Unit Awards(2)(3) Total\nWendy Arienzo ....................................................... $ 65,000 $ 118,992 $ 183,992\nNicholas E.

On April 3, 2023, Mr. Vig received an initial equity grant with an aggregate value of approximately $30,000\nwhich fully vested on May 19, 2023. An equity award with an aggregate value of approximately $120,000 was granted to each non-\nemployee director on July 3, 2023. No other equity awards were granted to non-employee directors in fiscal year 2023. The RSU grants\nwill vest immediately prior to the Annual Meeting, subject to the non-employee director’s continued service to the date of the Annual\nMeeting. The number of RSUs issued under such equity award was calculated as $120,000 divided by the per share fair market value\nof our common stock on the date of grant.\n28\nCOMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThe primary objectives of the Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation are as follows:\n1. To establish compensation levels that enable us to attract and retain qualified executive management;\n2. To fairly compensate executives for the value of work provided;\n3. To compensate executives for achieving specific company goals and objectives;\n4. To align the incentives of our executives with the interests of our stockholders by providing equity awards to executives\nso that each executive has a meaningful ownership interest in our company; and\n5. To implement executive compensation programs in an objective and non-discriminatory manner.\nTo achieve these objectives, the Compensation Committee implements and maintains compensation plans that tie a substantial\nportion of the executives’ overall compensation to our company’s financial performance and the price of our common stock. Overall,\nan executive’s total compensation is intended to create an executive compensation program that is set at levels competitive with the\nexecutive compensation paid by other comparable public technology companies.\nThe Compensation Committee believed the metrics of the 2023 executive compensation plan (the “2023 Plan”) were directly\ntied to our core operating performance, were key factors in driving stockholder value, and were important business elements that Power\nIntegrations’ executives could meaningfully influence. By focusing on these metrics, the Compensation Committee sought to align the\nfinancial interests of our executives with those of our stockholders.\nRole of Our Chief Executive Officer in Determining Compensation. Mr. Balakrishnan, Power Integrations’ president and\nchief executive officer, reviews with the Compensation Committee on a regular basis our compensation philosophy and programs,\nincluding with respect to the named executive officers (the executive officers appearing in our summary compensation table in this\nproxy), so that the Compensation Committee can make any changes necessary to keep the company’s compensation philosophy and\nprograms aligned with the company’s business objectives. Mr. Balakrishnan makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee\nwith respect to the compensation of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee also utilizes an outside compensation\nconsultant to stay abreast of developments in the competitive landscape for executive compensation. The Compensation Committee\nconsiders, but is not bound to and does not always accept, management’s and the outside consultant’s recommendations with respect to\nexecutive compensation. The Compensation Committee discusses Mr. Balakrishnan’s compensation with him, but deliberates and\nmakes decisions with respect to Mr. Balakrishnan’s compensation without him present.\nMr. Balakrishnan attends some of the Compensation Committee meetings, but leaves the meetings as appropriate when matters\nof executive compensation specific to him are discussed or voted upon.\nComparative Compensation Analysis and Role of Compensation Consultant. Power Integrations generally aligns both its\ncash and equity compensation to market comparables. In 2023, the Compensation Committee engaged an independent compensation\nconsulting firm, Radford, part of the Rewards and Solutions practice at Aon plc (“Aon”), to assist in the analysis of compensation survey\ndata. Aon attends Compensation Committee meetings from time to time and provides peer-group analysis, feedback and\nrecommendations to the Compensation Committee. In addition to survey data, the Compensation Committee considers from time to\ntime information reported in peer companies’ SEC filings for all elements of compensation, including salary, annual cash and equity\nincentive or bonus compensation, and equity compensation.\n29\nIn 2023, Aon performed a review of the performance metrics (revenue, non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals) used\nin connection with the establishment of the 2023 Plan, including the number of PSUs granted to each of the named executive officers,\nand the revenue target used in connection with the company’s grant of PRSUs.\nThe Compensation Committee utilized Aon’s compensation survey performed in October 2022 to complete the 2023\ncompensation review. The 2022 peer analysis considered peer companies to be U.S. based semiconductor companies with similar global\nscope and complexity, and businesses falling into specific categories of semiconductors and related services, such as integrated circuits,\nsemiconductor solutions and computer communications and with revenues between 50% to 250% Power Integrations’ revenues and\nmarket capitalizations of 33% to 300% of Power Integrations’ market capitalization. The peer group that resulted from this screening\nmethod consisted of 17 companies and was large and diverse enough that the addition or elimination of any two companies did not alter\nthe overall analysis materially.\nThe full list of seventeen companies was as follows:\nCompany Name Company Name\nAdvanced Energy Industries, Inc. Maxlinear, Inc.\nAllegro MicroSystems, Inc. Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.\nAmbarella, Inc. Rambus, Inc.\nAxcelis Technologies, Inc. Semtech Corporation\nCirrus Logic, Inc. Silicon Labs, Inc.\nDiodes, Inc. Synaptics Incorporated\nKnowles Corporation Universal Display Corporation\nLattice Semiconductor Corporation Wolfspeed, Inc.\nMACOM Technology Solutions, Inc.\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee continued to utilize the 50th percentile as a general reference point, but not a specific\ntarget, for the aggregate value of base salary and target performance-based equity incentive compensation for the named executive\nofficers, and the 75th percentile as a general reference point, but not a specific target, for long-term equity incentive compensation. The\nCompensation Committee continued to utilize a higher general reference point for long-term equity incentive compensation than the\nother components of executive compensation to provide a stronger incentive to the executive officers to manage the company as owners\nwith equity stakes in the business.\nIn 2023, based on the 2022 Aon survey data and other relevant factors, the Compensation Committee determined it was\nappropriate that Mr. Balakrishnan’s and the named executive officers’ equity compensation and equity grants for 2023 be the same\ncombination of RSUs, PSUs and PRSUs as was granted in 2022. The PRSU grants are intended to promote and retain stability within\nthe executive team by setting multi-year performance targets.\nThe Compensation Committee is not bound by award formulas and is free to exercise its discretion to adjust salaries, bonus\nawards and equity awards. Generally, in arriving at compensation levels the Compensation Committee also considers the pay history of\neach executive, the relative pay among executives, the performance of the company and the performance and experience of each\nexecutive.\nThe Role of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes. Each year since 2011, we have provided our stockholders with the opportunity to\ncast an advisory vote on executive compensation, and at each of these annual meetings of stockholders our stockholders approved the\ndisclosure of the executive compensation plans. In 2023, more than 95% of the shares present and entitled to vote at the annual meetings\nof stockholders were cast in favor of the disclosure of the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee\nviewed this approval as a strong endorsement of our compensation policies and practices and continued to conduct itself in a manner\nconsistent with past practice in establishing the following year’s base salaries and equity compensation. Although the stockholder vote\nis non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of future votes, including the vote which will take place at the\nAnnual Meeting, when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers.\nExecutive Compensation Components\nThe 2023 Plan comprised the following components:\na) base salary,\nb) performance-based equity incentive awards (“PSUs”),\nc) long-term performance-based equity incentive awards (“PRSUs”) and\nd) long-term time-based equity incentive awards (“RSUs”).\n30\nIn addition, the named executive officers are eligible to participate in our health and welfare programs, employee stock purchase\nplan (subject to limitations), 401(k) plan and other benefit programs generally available to employees of the company.\nBase Salary. We pay a base salary to each of our named executive officers to provide an appropriate and competitive base level\nof current cash income. The Compensation Committee generally reviews base salaries annually, and adjusts them from time to time to\nrealign salaries with perceived market levels after taking into account individual responsibilities, performance and experience. In 2023,\nthe Compensation Committee granted salary increases of approximately 2% for the Company’s chief executive officer and 5% for the\nother named executive officers. The adjusted salary levels were consistent with peer company salary levels for analogous positions.\nShort-term Performance-based Equity Incentive Awards. The Compensation Committee believes that a substantial portion of\nthe annual compensation for each executive officer should be in the form of variable (i.e., performance-based) equity incentive awards.\nThese awards are intended to compensate executive officers for achieving annual financial goals at the corporate level. The\nCompensation Committee utilizes these awards to attract and retain qualified executives, align their interests with those of the\nCompany’s stockholders, and provide appropriate executive and leadership incentives.\nIn 2023, as in prior years, the Compensation Committee granted performance-based equity incentive awards in the form of\nPSUs. The aggregate value of PSUs awarded on the grant date to all of the named executive officers was approximately 12% higher\nthan the PSUs awarded pursuant to the 2022 Plan. The PSUs are awarded at the beginning of the fiscal year in the amount of 200% of\nthe number of shares that will ultimately vest if the one-year target performance criteria are met but not exceeded. The PSUs vest\ndepending on the extent to which the Company meets or exceeds the minimum performance criteria discussed under “Mechanics of\n2023 Performance-based Equity Incentive Awards” below; the amount of shares vesting can range from zero to 100% of the shares\nawarded.\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee utilized an Aon survey and 2022 peer group analysis directly comparing the value of\nindividual 2022 target PSU awards with the short-term incentive compensation paid to executive officers in analogous positions at peer\ncompanies in verifying the Compensation Committee’s general reference point for the 2023 target value. The value of the PSU grants\nfor each officer at target was between the 25th and 50th percentiles of the value of cash targets for each position in the Aon survey.\nOverall, the value of 2023 PSU target compensation was approximately 139% of the annual base salary for the company’s chief\nexecutive officer and approximately 71% to 77% of annual base salary for the company’s other named executive officers.\nThese percentages are consistent with 2022 and positioned between the 25th and 50th percentiles for similar compensation at our peer\ncompanies.\nMechanics of 2023 Performance-based Equity Incentive Awards\nFor the 2023 Plan, the Compensation Committee determined that the number of shares subject to the PSUs that would ultimately\nvest, and therefore our officers would receive, would be determined based upon the company’s 2023 performance in three areas: net\nrevenue, non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals. The Compensation Committee’s intent in the design of the 2023 Plan was to\nemphasize revenue growth and to focus management on operating profitability by tying vesting to non-GAAP operating income (as\ndefined below) and create long-term value for our stockholders. The weighting of these components was as follows:\nThreshold(1) Target(2) Maximum(3)\nNet revenue ................................................................ 0 % 35% 70%\nNon-GAAP operating income ................................................. 0 % 35% 70%\nStrategic goals .............................................................. 0 % 30% 60%\nTotal ...................................................................... 0 % 100% 200%\n(1) No PSUs would vest for a specific performance goal if Power Integrations’ 2023 actual net revenue or revenue growth rate,\nactual non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals, as applicable, did not exceed at least an established minimum amount\nas set forth in the 2023 Plan.\n(2) Target represents the number of PSUs which would vest for a specific goal if Power Integrations’ 2023 actual net revenue or\nrevenue growth, actual non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals, as applicable, met but did not exceed the established\ntarget amount as set forth in the 2023 Plan.\n(3) Maximum represents the maximum awards which could vest for a specific goal if Power Integrations’ 2023 actual net revenue\nor revenue growth, actual non-GAAP operating income and strategic goals, as applicable, met or exceeded the established\nmaximum amounts as set forth in the 2023 Plan.\n“Non-GAAP operating income” means operating income for 2023 determined in accordance with the generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) but excluding the following items: (i) stock-based compensation expenses recorded\nunder Accounting Standard Codification 718-10; (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the fair-value write-up of\nacquired inventory, (iii) any other expenses related to mergers and acquisitions and (iv) any other adjustment made to arrive at the\n31\ncompany’s non-GAAP financial information as presented in our SEC filings. The Compensation Committee excluded these items\nbecause the Compensation Committee reasoned that these items were not indicative of operating performance and did not relate to\nachieving Power Integrations’ compensation objectives.\nRevenue Component:\nThe Company regards revenue growth as a key measure of its success and maintains a goal of growing revenues at a rate\nexceeding that of the analog semiconductor industry as reported by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”). The Compensation\nCommittee set the below revenue thresholds based on the prevailing macroeconomic and industry conditions, intending that the difficulty\nof attaining the thresholds would be consistent with that of prior years, i.e., that the target and maximum levels under the 2023 Plan\nrepresented challenging, aggressive goals.\nThe PSUs vesting under the revenue component shall be calculated based on an Absolute Measure and Relative Measure, each\nas described below, with the higher of the two calculations resulting in the actual shares vested.\nAbsolute Measure: The PSUs would not vest for the named executive officers with respect to the revenue component of the\n2023 Plan if 2023 revenues failed to exceed $540 million. To the extent 2023 actual revenues exceeded $540 million, the number of\nshares subject to the PSUs vesting would have increased linearly from zero at $540 million, up to 100% of the target amount at $590\nmillion, and linearly from that level up to a maximum of 200% of the target amount at $620 million.\nRelative Measure: The PSUs would not vest for the named executive officers with respect to the revenue component of the\n2023 Plan if the Company’s revenue annual growth rate (“AGR”) for the year ended December 31, 2023, failed to exceed a minimum\nthreshold set at four percentage points lower than the revenue AGR of the analog semiconductor industry (the “Index”), derived using\nhistorical and forecasted revenue data reported by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”). To the extent the Company’s\nrevenue AGR exceeded the minimum threshold of four percentage points below the Index, the number of PSU shares vesting would\nhave increased linearly from zero at the minimum threshold, up to 100% of the target amount when the Company’s revenue AGR was\nequal to the Index, and linearly from that level up to a maximum of 200% of the target amount when the Company’s revenue AGR was\nequal to or greater than four percentage points higher than the Index. In the event that the Company’s revenue AGR is zero or negative,\nvesting is limited to no more than 100% of the target amount. In January 2024, under the revenue component, based on the $444.5\nmillion of net revenue achieved in 2023, the Compensation Committee determined that none of the total target PSUs awarded would\nvest in 2024.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income Component:\nThe PSUs would not vest for the named executive officers with respect to the non-GAAP operating income component of the\n2023 Plan if 2023 non-GAAP operating income failed to exceed $129.1 million. To the extent actual non-GAAP operating income\nexceeded $129.1 million, the number of shares subject to the PSUs vesting would have increased linearly from zero at $129.1 million\nof non-GAAP operating income up to 100% of the target amount at $152.3 million, and linearly from that level up to a maximum of\n200% of the target amount at $162.1 million. The non-GAAP operating income thresholds were derived from the revenue thresholds\nbased on the Board-approved budget for 2023. The Compensation Committee believed that reaching these levels would have been\nunlikely without market-share gains and operational effectiveness. In January 2024, under the non-GAAP operating income component,\nbased on the $65.5 million of non-GAAP operating income achieved in 2023, the Compensation Committee determined that none of\nthe total target PSUs awarded would vest in 2024.\nStrategic Goals Component:\nThe PSUs would not vest for the named executive officers with respect to the strategic-goals component of the 2023 Plan if the\nestablished goals were not achieved. Each of the strategic goals was assigned a percentage of 2% to 18% adding up to 30% of the target.\nThe strategic-goals portion of the 2023 Plan consisted of five strategic goals, including goals related to product development, design\nwins impacting future revenue growth, targeted market penetration through flat rate of design wins, increased wafer and manufacturing\ncapacity and manufacturing cost reductions. If all of the strategic goals met or exceeded the minimum established threshold, then the\nnumber of shares subject to PSU vesting for the strategic goals component would have increased linearly from zero at the minimum\nlevel up to 100% if the target strategic goals were met, and up to a maximum of 200% if the stretch strategic goals were met or exceeded.\nIn January 2024, under the strategic goals component, based on the level of strategic goals achieved in 2023, the Compensation\nCommittee determined that approximately 200% of the total target PSUs awarded would vest in 2024.\nLong-term Equity Incentive Awards. In 2023, the Compensation Committee approved grants of RSUs and PRSUs. The RSU\nawards typically have a four-year vesting period with one-fourth of the RSUs vesting on each anniversary of the grant-date over\nfour years, in accordance with the Company’s standard vesting schedule for RSUs. The Company’s PRSU program provides for the\nissuance of PRSUs which will vest on the three-year period ending December 31, 2025, based on the Company’s performance measured\nagainst the PRSU program’s established performance targets. PRSUs are granted in an amount equal to twice the target number of shares\n32\nto be issued if the maximum performance metrics are met. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end\nof a three-year performance period based on results achieved versus the Company’s performance goals, and may range from zero to\n200% of the target number. The actual vesting for PRSUs granted in fiscal 2023 shall be based on higher achievement under either the\n“Relative Measure” or the “Absolute Measure”. The Relative Measure is based on the Company’s compound annual growth rate\n(“CAGR”) of revenue as measured against the revenue CAGR of the analog semiconductor industry (“Relative Measure”), over the\nrespective three-year performance period. The Absolute Measure is a performance goal related to the Company’s revenue growth over\nthe respective three-year performance period as compared to defined internal revenue targets. Both described measures of multi-year\ntargets for growth are intended to have difficulty in attaining. As with the PSUs, the PRSUs are awarded in the amount of 200% of the\nnumber of shares that will ultimately vest if the target revenue threshold is met but not exceeded, with the full amount vesting if the\nmaximum is met or exceeded. The portion of PRSUs that will vest will be calculated as described above for the three-year period ending\nDecember 31, 2025 as compared to the established minimum, target and maximum thresholds, and will vest in early 2026 upon\ndetermination by the Compensation Committee of the achievement of the performance condition. In the event of any mergers,\nacquisitions or divestitures or any patent or other litigation settlements or judgements during the performance period, the minimum,\ntarget and maximum revenue thresholds shall be adjusted based on an approved plan presented to the Board.\nThe 2023 PRSU awards would not vest in early 2026 if the Company’s actual revenue CAGR or net revenues for the three-year\nperiod ending December 31, 2025 does not exceed at least the established minimum threshold amount under either the Relative Measure\nor Absolute Measure, respectively. To the extent the revenue CAGR or net revenues for the three-year period ending December 31, 2025\nexceeds the minimum threshold, the PRSU vesting would increase linearly from zero at the minimum threshold up to 100% of the target\nthreshold, with the number of shares vesting increasing linearly above the target threshold, up to a maximum of 200% of the target\namount of shares based on higher achievement under the Relative Measure or the Absolute Measure. At this point, based on current\nprojections, no vesting of PRSUs would be achieved.\nDetermination of Amounts of RSUs and PRSUs\nThe Compensation Committee approved a target PRSU grant of 40,400 units and a RSU grant of 40,400 units, to\nMr. Balakrishnan. The aggregate target grant-date fair value of these grants was $6.5 million. The Compensation Committee considered\nthe value of the PRSU grant as a percentage of the total long-term equity award. For the chief executive officer’s 2023 equity grants,\nthe Compensation Committee awarded 50% in the form of target PRSUs and 50% in the form of RSUs. This percentage was deemed\nappropriate considering the difficulty of setting long-term performance criteria in an industry experiencing constant and disruptive\nchange.\nThe Compensation Committee approved a target PRSU grant of 8,500 units and a RSU grant of 25,500 units with an aggregate\ntarget grant-date fair value of approximately $2.7 million to Mr. Nayyar. For Mr. Barsan, the Compensation Committee approved a\ntarget PRSU grant of 5,600 units and a RSU grant of 16,800 units with an aggregate target grant-date fair value of approximately\n$1.8 million. For Mr. Gupta the Compensation Committee approved a target PRSU grant of 4,700 units and a RSU grant of 14,100 units\nwith an aggregate target grant-date fair value of approximately $1.5 million. For Mr. Yee, the Compensation Committee approved a\ntarget PRSU grant of 3,300 units and a RSU grant of 9,900 units with an aggregate target grant-date fair value of approximately\n$1.1 million.\nThe total value of the long-term incentive awards for the named executive officers was determined considering both the\nleadership and relative contribution of each executive to the performance of the company, and the long-term incentive pay of peer\ncompanies along with data from Aon. As a group, the value of the long-term incentive grants noted above to the named executive\nofficers was positioned at the 50th percentiles for similar compensation at our peer companies.\nStock Ownership Guideline. In April 2013, the company established a CEO stock-ownership guideline, believing that\nownership of the Company’s common stock is an effective means to reinforce alignment of the chief executive officer’s interests with\nthose of the Company’s stockholders, and such guidelines were amended in April 2021. Our chief executive officer is required to own\na number of shares of the Company’s common stock having a value equal to at least three times his current base salary. This stock\nownership guideline provides for a three-year period to attain the target ownership level. As of March 22, 2024, Mr. Balakrishnan’s\nstock ownership exceeded the stock ownership guidelines.\nEmployment Agreements. The named executive officers are employed at-will. Based on the Company’s desire to link executive\ncompensation with performance, the executive-compensation program does not include employment agreements.\nOther Compensation. Our executive officers are party to benefits agreements and offer letters (“Employment Benefits\nAgreements”) that contain provisions regarding severance benefits in the event the executive is terminated without cause, resigns for\ngood reason or is terminated within 18 months following a change of control or Mr. Balakrishnan ceasing to be our chief executive\nofficer (a “Termination upon Change of Control”).\n33\nIn the event of a termination without cause or resignation for good reason these benefits include (i) a cash severance payment\nbased upon the executive’s highest annual salary from the company in the preceding three years and 50% of the value of the executive’s\nannual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level (100% in the case of\nMr. Balakrishnan), (ii) payment of a pro-rated portion, based on the number of days served in the performance period, of the executive’s\ntargeted annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level, (iii) the pro-rated portion of\nany PRSUs earned prior to termination at the performance level as determined by the Board or Compensation Committee on the date of\ndetermination, (iv) continued health coverage and (v) in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan, accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs.\nIf the executive incurs a Termination upon Change of Control, the benefits include (i) a cash severance payment based upon\nthe executive’s highest annual salary from the company in the preceding three years and 50% of the value of the executive’s annual\nperformance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level (200% in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan and\nup to 100% in the case of any senior executives), (ii) payment of a pro-rated portion of the executive’s targeted annual performance-\nbased equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level, (iii) 100% accelerated vesting of outstanding PSUs and\nPRSUs at the maximum applicable performance level, (iv) in the case of a change of control without termination, 25% accelerated\nvesting of stock options and RSUs, provided, however (a) Mr. Balakrishnan’s stock options and RSUs vest in full, and (b) 50% (or\n100% if a senior executive) of all stock options and RSUs shall vest in full prior to Change of Control to the extent the acquiring\ncompany does not assume the company’s stock options and RSUs.\nAfter a set age, if an executive officer retires following an extended amount of service to our company, the executive officer\nmay also receive continued health plan coverage, a pro-rated portion of any PRSUs earned prior to termination at the performance level\nas determined by the Board or Compensation Committee, and extended time to exercise stock options pursuant to the Employment\nBenefits Agreements. The Compensation Committee approved these Employment Benefits Agreements because it believes these\nseverance provisions are necessary to retain our current executives and to attract future executives. The level of benefits under the\nEmployment Benefits Agreements was established by the Compensation Committee to provide retention incentives in line with similar\nincentives at comparable companies. Certain of these severance benefits are coupled with non-competition and non-solicitation\nobligations intended to protect our proprietary data that might not be enforceable in the absence of additional consideration. The\nseverance benefits are also intended to attract and retain executive officers by mitigating the risk of employment and compensation loss\ndue to a change of control. A summary of the material terms of these Employment Benefits Agreements, together with a quantification\nof the benefits available under the benefits agreements, may be found in the section below entitled “Summary of Executive\nCompensation-Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change of Control Agreements.”\nPerquisites and Generally Available Benefit Programs. We annually review the perquisites that named executive officers\nreceive. Our named executive officers, like our other employees, are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan. In\naddition, the named executive officers may participate in the various employee benefit plans that are generally available to all employees,\nincluding medical, vision and dental care plans; flexible spending accounts for healthcare; life, accidental death and dismemberment\nand disability insurance; and paid time off.\nWe also maintain a 401(k) retirement savings plan for the benefit of all of our employees, including our named executive\nofficers. In 2023, 2022 and 2021 Power Integrations contributed to the employee 401(k) plan; the plan provided a contribution match\nof 4% of salary up to a maximum of $13,200 in 2023, $12,200 in 2022, and $11,600 in 2021.The Company’s contribution is discretionary\nand the decision to contribute is made by the company each year based on business conditions. We do not provide specified retirement\nprograms such as pension plans, or deferred compensation plans. We provide certain retirement benefits to the named executive officers,\nas described below under the heading “Retirement Benefits.”\nCompensation “Clawback”. In 2009, we implemented a compensation “clawback” mechanism with respect to compensation\nof our executive officers. The claw-back conditions the payment of any cash or equity bonuses to executive officers on an agreement to\nrepay a portion of the bonuses in the event of a financial accounting restatement resulting from error or intentional misconduct by the\nofficers. Specifically, any officer determined by the Board to have engaged in intentional misconduct resulting in material\nnoncompliance by the company with any financial reporting requirements of federal securities laws, in turn resulting in the restatement\nof any financial statement filed in the twelve months prior to the bonus payout, will reimburse the company the difference between the\namount of any bonus received and the amount the officer would have received had the amount of the bonus been calculated based on\nthe restated financial statements. We adopted a new Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, effective as of October 2, 2023 to\ncomply with Nasdaq listing standards, which requires the “clawback” of incentive compensation paid to current and former executive\nofficers when that compensation is based upon achievement of financial results that later require a restatement whether or not resulting\nfrom error or intentional misconduct by such executive officers.\nA copy of the Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy is included as Exhibit 97 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n34\nCompensation Committee Report*\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis\ncontained in this proxy statement. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board\nthat the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated into Power Integrations’ Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nCompensation Committee:\nWendy Arienzo (Chair)\nNicholas Brathwaite\nNancy Gioia\n∗ The material in this report is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed “filed” with the SEC, and is not to be incorporated by reference\ninto any filing of Power Integrations under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Act, whether made\nbefore or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language contained in such filing.\n35\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table shows the compensation awarded to, or earned by, our chief executive officer, our chief financial officer\nand our three other most highly compensated executive officers serving in such capacity at December 31, 2023.

The grant-date fair value was calculated\nby multiplying the closing stock price on the grant date by each award, reduced by the discounted present value of dividends\nexpected to be declared before the awards vest.\na. The amounts for 2023 are presented at target. Assuming the maximum level of performance conditions was achieved\nfor performance-based awards, the grant-date fair value of the stock awards granted to Mr. Balakrishnan, Mr. Nayyar,\nMr. Barsan, Mr. Gupta and Mr. Yee in 2023 is $11,755,296, $4,112,345, $2,896,047, $2,451,509 and $1,871,719,\nrespectively.\nb.

An\nexecutive officer benefits agreement was also entered into with Sunil Gupta, vice president, operations, and Yang Chiah Yee, vice\npresident, worldwide sales, in connection with commencement of their employment in February 2021 and July 2021, respectively, of\nwhich both were amended in August 2022 solely to grant Mr. Gupta and Mr. Yee the benefits of a senior executive. The executive\nofficers’ benefits agreements referenced in this paragraph, including the CEO Benefits Agreement, as amended as the case may be, are\nreferred to as the “Executive Officer Benefits Agreements,” and the executive officers referred to in this paragraph, are referred to as\nthe “Officers.” The Executive Officer Benefits Agreements, as amended as the case may be, provide for certain benefits, as described\n39\nbelow, including: acceleration of vesting of stock options, RSUs, and in certain circumstances, PSUs, and PRSUs, upon a change of\ncontrol of Power Integrations,\n• severance benefits in the event of termination of employment by Power Integrations without cause or resignation by\nthe Officer for good reason within 18 months after a change of control or change in our chief executive officer (a\n“Termination Upon Change of Control”),\n• severance benefits in the event of termination of employment by Power Integrations without cause or resignation by\nthe Officer for good reason, and\n• retirement benefits.\nThese benefits are coupled with non-competition obligations that might not be enforceable in the absence of additional\nconsideration. The executive officers must also execute a release of claims in a form reasonably satisfactory to the company and continue\nto abide by the terms and conditions of any confidentiality and/or proprietary rights agreement between the respective executive officers\nand the company.\nA change of control is defined in the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements as an acquisition by any person of a beneficial\nownership of 50% or more of Power Integrations’ voting stock or outstanding shares of common stock, certain mergers or other business\ncombinations involving Power Integrations, the sale of more than 50% of Power Integrations’ assets, liquidation of Power Integrations,\nor a change in the majority of the incumbent members of the Board within a two-year period (except changes in the Board’s composition\napproved by a majority of the directors). “Cause” includes, among other acts, a material act of theft, dishonesty, fraud, falsification of\nrecords, improper disclosure of confidential information, or an intentional act by the Officer causing harm to the reputation of Power\nIntegrations, and “good reason” includes, among other acts, a material decrease in the Officer’s compensation or benefits following a\nchange of control, a demotion or material reduction in responsibility level, or relocation of more than 50 miles from the Officer’s current\nwork place or a material adverse change in working conditions or established working hours which persist for a period of six months.\nUpon a change of control, 100% of Mr. Balakrishnan’s then-unvested shares subject to options or RSUs will vest and all then-\nunvested shares subject to PSUs and PRSUs shall accelerate and vest at the maximum performance level for each applicable award\nimmediately prior to the consummation of the change of control. With respect to the other Officers, upon a change of control, 100% of\nthe then-unvested shares subject to PSUs and PRSUs shall accelerate and vest at the maximum performance level for each applicable\naward immediately prior to the consummation of the change of control, and 25% of the Officer’s then-unvested shares subject to options\nor RSUs will vest. However, if an acquiring company does not assume the options or RSUs, 50% of the Officer’s then-unvested shares\nwill vest if the Officer is a “new executive” (generally an executive with fewer than five years of service to Power Integrations as an\nexecutive officer) and 100% of the Officer’s then-unvested shares will vest if the Officer is a “senior executive” (generally an executive\nwith at least five years of continuous service to Power Integrations as an executive officer). Mr. Nayyar, Mr. Barsan, Mr. Gupta and\nMr. Yee are senior executives.\nMr. Balakrishnan is entitled to severance benefits in the event that he is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason\nwithin 18 months after a change of control. These severance benefits include a payment equal to the sum of two years of his highest\nannual salary in the preceding three years (or his currently effective salary if it would be his highest annual salary) from Power\nIntegrations plus 200% of the cash value of his targeted annual performance-based equity incentive awards, at the maximum achievable\nperformance level (whether consisting of cash or stock awards, measured as of the date of termination). Also, Mr. Balakrishnan shall\nreceive the cash value of that portion of his then effective targeted annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum\nachievable performance level as measured on the date of termination, prorated based on days through the date of termination (i.e., a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the applicable performance period prior to such termination of employment\nand the denominator of which is the total number of days in the applicable performance period). In addition, Mr. Balakrishnan shall\nreceive accelerated vesting of 100% of all his then-outstanding stock options and other stock awards (to the extent such stock awards\ndo not constitute a portion of his annual performance-based equity incentive awards), extension of the post-termination stock option\nexercise period to one year, and continued medical and dental coverage under the Power Integrations’ health plans for twenty-\nfour months at Power Integrations’ expense.\nEach Officer other than Mr. Balakrishnan is entitled to severance benefits in the event that such Officer is terminated without\n“cause” or resigns for “good reason” within 18 months after (i) a change of control or (ii) the date that Mr. Balakrishnan ceases to serve\nas chief executive officer. These severance benefits include a payment equal to six months of the Officer’s highest annual salary in the\npreceding three years (or the Officer’s currently effective salary if it would be such Officer’s highest annual salary) from Power\nIntegrations plus the cash value of 50% of the Officer’s targeted annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum\nachievable performance level (whether consisting of cash or stock awards measured as of the date of termination) and for a senior\nexecutive, up to an additional six months of the Officer’s highest annual salary and the cash value of 50% of the Officer’s annual\nperformance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum achievable performance level (whether consisting of cash or stock awards,\nmeasured as of the date of termination) until such senior executive secures new employment, paid on a ratable monthly basis. Also, the\nOfficer shall receive the cash value of that portion of the Officer’s then effective targeted annual performance-based equity incentive\n40\nawards at the maximum achievable performance level as measured on the date of termination, prorated based on days through the date\nof termination (i.e., a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the applicable performance period prior to such\ntermination of employment and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the applicable performance period). In addition,\neach Officer is entitled to the accelerated vesting of 50% of then-unvested shares subject to options or stock awards (to the extent such\nstock awards do not constitute a portion of the Officer’s annual performance-based equity incentive awards) if the Officer is a new\nexecutive, or vesting of 100% of then unvested shares subject to options or stock awards (to the extent such stock awards do not constitute\na portion of the Officer’s annual performance-based equity incentive awards) if the Officer is a senior executive, extension of the post-\ntermination stock option exercise period to one year for vested options, and continued medical and dental coverage under the Power\nIntegrations’ health plans at Power Integrations’ expense for up to six months if the Officer is a new executive, or for up to twelve months\nif the Officer is a senior executive.\nIn addition, each Officer is entitled to severance benefits in the event of termination of employment by Power Integrations\nwithout cause or resignation by such Officer for good reason. Such severance benefits include a payment equal to six months\n(twelve months in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan) of the Officer’s highest annual salary in the preceding three years (or the Officer’s\ncurrently effective salary if it would be such Officer’s highest annual salary) plus 50% (100% in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan) of the\nOfficer’s annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum achievable performance level (whether consisting of cash\nor stock awards, measured as of the date of termination), and the cash value of that portion of the Officer’s then effective targeted annual\nperformance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum achievable performance level as measured on the date of termination,\nprorated based on days through the date of termination. In addition, each Officer and Mr. Balakrishnan is entitled to receive a pro rata\nportion of any outstanding PRSUs based on the number of days served by such Officer, or Mr. Balakrishnan, prior to the date of\ntermination as compared to the performance period for such PRSUs, with any such PRSU vesting at the performance levels as determined\nby the Power Integrations’ Board or Compensation Committee on the date of determination, as well as continued medical and dental\ncoverage under the Power Integrations’ health plans for six months (twelve months in the case of Mr. Balakrishnan) at Power\nIntegrations’ expense. In addition, Mr. Balakrishnan is entitled to vesting acceleration of 50% of all his then-unvested stock options and\nRSUs.\nEach Officer is entitled to retirement benefits if he has served Power Integrations for 15 years and has achieved an age of 50,\nor has served Power Integrations for 10 years and has achieved an age of 55, is not employed elsewhere, full time (other than for an\norganization described in section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended), or otherwise engaged in “Competition”\n(as defined in the Executive Officer Benefits Agreement) with Power Integrations, and does not recruit or employ any present or future\nemployee of Power Integrations. The Officer is entitled to the extension of his post-termination stock option exercise period for vested\noptions for the earlier of the term of the option (not to exceed five years in the case of Officers other than Mr. Balakrishnan) or the\ntermination of the option in connection with any change of control and medical and dental benefits for such Officer and such Officer’s\ndependents at Power Integrations’ expense until such Officer achieves the age of 65; thereafter, participation in the health plans would\nbe at the Officer’s expense. In addition, each Officer and Mr. Balakrishnan is entitled to receive a pro-rated portion of any outstanding\nPRSUs based on the number of days served by such Officer or Mr. Balakrishnan, prior to the date of retirement as compared to the\nperformance period for such PRSUs, with any such PRSU vesting at the performance levels as determined by the Power Integrations’\nBoard or Compensation Committee on the date of determination. In the event the Officer’s service to Power Integrations’ is terminated\ndue to death or permanent disability after satisfying the requirements to achieve retirement benefits, such Officer, or such Officer’s\nbeneficiaries, shall be entitled to the preceding benefits.\nPower Integrations will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that the Officer will continue to be eligible for coverage\nunder Power Integrations’ medical and dental plans upon retirement. These retirement benefits will also become available if an Officer\nwas eligible for such benefits and his employment terminates due to death or disability.\nIf any of the payments and benefits provided under the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements in connection with a change of\ncontrol (the “Payments”) would result in a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,\nthe amount of such Payments will be either (i) the full amount of the Payments or (ii) a reduced amount which would result in no portion\nof the Payments being subject to excise tax (as defined in the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements, as amended), whichever amount\nprovides the greatest amount of benefit to the Officer.\n41\nRetirement Benefits\nThe following table provides information concerning the actuarial present value of retirement health benefits as of\nDecember 31, 2023, for each named executive officer.\nPresent Value of\nNumber of Years Accumulated\nName Credited Service Benefit (in $000)\nBalu Balakrishnan .............................................................. 35 —\nSandeep Nayyar ............................................................... 13 $ 18\nRadu Barsan .................................................................. 10 —\nSunil Gupta ................................................................... 2 $ 35\nYang Chiah Yee ............................................................... 2 $ 39\nHaving reached the appropriate age and the required years of service with Power Integrations, Mr. Nayyar and his spouse are\neligible to receive medical benefits upon retirement until they achieve the age of 65. Having reached the age of 65 Messrs. Balakrishnan\nand Barsan are not eligible to receive medical benefits upon retirement. The valuation method and all material assumptions are as\nfollows: The amounts determined in the above table are associated with the provision of health care coverage after retirement. The\nvaluation method is pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification 715, Retirement\nBenefits Compensation, (“ASC 715”). The Projected Unit Credit attribution method was used; the attribution of the obligation is over\nthe period from hire to benefit eligibility (the earlier of age 50 with 15 years of service or age 55 with 10 years of service). Other than\nfor eligibility purposes, service is not considered in the calculation. The benefit consists of health-care coverage from retirement until\nage 65. The basis for the benefit is premiums paid by the employer to a third-party insurer, without additional subsidy imputed. The\nobligations were calculated using the following assumptions:\n• The discount rate for future payments was 6.01% as of December 31, 2023.\n• The assumed annual increase in health care costs is 10% as of December 31, 2023, with the annual increase lessening\nby ½% per year, to an ultimate rate of 5% after 2035.\n• 25% of active participants are assumed to become eligible and elect coverage at retirement.\n• Retirement is assumed to take place at age 62, or at first eligibility if older.\n• 2/3 of active employees are assumed to have eligible spouses who, at the employee’s retirement, will be covered by\nthe plan. Husbands are assumed to be three years older than their wives.\n42\nPotential Payments upon Retirement or Change of Control\nThe following table provides information concerning the estimated payments and benefits that would be provided in each of\nthe circumstances described above. Payments and benefits are estimated assuming that the triggering event took place on December 31,\n2023, and the price per share of Power Integrations’ common stock is $82.11, the closing price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on\nDecember 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023. There can be no assurance that a triggering event would produce the same or similar\nresults as those estimated below if such event occurs on any other date or at any other price, or if any other assumption used to estimate\npotential payments and benefits is not correct. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any potential payments\nor benefits, any actual payments and benefits may be different. The information presented below assumes no adjustment of the payment\nof benefits to help avoid excise tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nPotential Payments Upon Involuntary\nTermination Other Than for Cause or\nVoluntary Termination for Good Continuation of Service Without Termination\nReason After Change of Control\nNot within 18 Within 18\nmonths of a months of a Acquiring Company Acquiring Company\nRetirement Change of Change of Assumes Does Not Assume\nName/Type of Benefit Benefits Control (1) Control (2) RSUs/PRSUs(3) RSUs/PRSUs(4)\nBalu Balakrishnan\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 710,000 $ 1,420,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 1,970,640 3,941,280 1,970,640 1,970,640\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — 5,312,517 10,625,034 10,625,034 10,625,034\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 17,144,568 17,144,568 17,144,568\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ — 27,494 54,988 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ — $ 8,020,651 $ 33,185,870 $ 29,740,242 $ 29,740,242\nSandeep Nayyar\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 225,000 $ 450,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 344,862 689,724 689,724 689,724\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — — 4,403,149 1,100,787 4,403,149\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 2,791,740 2,791,740 2,791,740\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ 36,045 25,301 50,602 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ 36,045 $ 595,163 $ 8,385,215 $ 4,582,251 $ 7,884,613\nRadu Barsan\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 207,500 $ 415,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 320,229 640,458 640,458 640,458\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — — 3,304,928 826,232 3,304,928\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 2,052,750 2,052,750 2,052,750\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ — 9,917 19,834 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ — $ 537,646 $ 6,432,970 $ 3,519,440 $ 5,998,136\nSunil Gupta\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 192,500 $ 385,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 279,174 558,348 558,348 558,348\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — — 2,367,149 591,787 2,367,149\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 1,642,200 1,642,200 1,642,200\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ — 25,301 50,602 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ — $ 496,975 $ 5,003,299 $ 2,792,335 $ 4,567,697\nYang Chiah Yee\nCash Severance-Base Salary ..................... $ — $ 192,500 $ 385,000 $ — $ —\nSeverance-Equity Bonus (5) ...................... — 270,963 541,926 541,926 541,926\nRSU Vesting Acceleration (6) ..................... — — 1,976,716 494,179 1,976,716\nPRSU Vesting Acceleration (7) .................... — — 1,439,388 1,439,388 1,439,388\nContinued Coverage of Employee Benefits (8) ........ — 28,323 56,646 — —\nTotal Termination Benefits: (9) .................... $ — $ 491,786 $ 4,399,676 $ 2,475,493 $ 3,958,030\n(1) Reflects benefits in the event of involuntary termination other than for cause or voluntary termination for good reason: with\nrespect to Mr. Balakrishnan twelve months salary plus his annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum\napplicable performance level (measured as of the termination date), plus 50% acceleration of all his then-unvested RSUs plus\ntwelve months medical and dental coverage; and with respect to all other named executive officers, six months of salary plus\n50% of the executive officer’s annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance\nlevel (whether consisting of cash or PSUs, measured as of the termination date) plus six months of medical and dental coverage.\n(2) For termination within 18 months of a change of control (which, for these purposes for executive officers other than\nMr. Balakrishnan, includes Mr. Balakrishnan ceasing to be our chief executive officer) other than for cause or voluntary\ntermination for good reason: with respect to Mr. Balakrishnan twenty-four months’ salary plus 200% of his annual\n43\nperformance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level (measured as of the termination\ndate), 100% acceleration of all his then-unvested RSUs and PRSUs at maximum performance level and two years medical and\ndental coverage; for all others, six months’ salary plus 50% of the executive officer’s annual performance-based equity\nincentive awards at the maximum applicable performance level (whether consisting of cash or stock awards, measured as of\nthe termination date), 100% of unvested RSUs would vest upon a change of control for senior executives and 50% of unvested\nRSUs would vest upon change of control for new executives and 12 months medical and dental coverage for senior executives\nand six months medical and dental coverage for new executives. If executive is a senior executive, payment up to an additional\nsix months’ salary and 50% of the executive officer’s annual performance-based equity incentive awards at the maximum\napplicable performance level (measured as of the termination date) will be paid in ratable monthly installments until the\nexecutive secures new employment. The amounts set forth in the table assume that the senior executives will not secure new\nemployment.\n(3) Reflects benefits in the event of a change of control in which the acquiring company assumes outstanding RSUs. With respect\nto Mr. Balakrishnan 100% of all his then-unvested RSUs would vest; for all others, 25% of the unvested RSUs would vest.\n(4) Reflects benefits in the event of a change of control in which the acquiring company did not assume outstanding RSUs. With\nrespect to Mr. Balakrishnan 100% of all his then-unvested RSUs would vest and for all others, 50% of the unvested RSUs\nwould vest for a new executive and 100% for a senior executive.\n(5) In mid-2009, Power Integrations began utilizing annual PSUs in lieu of cash for Power Integrations’ annual performance-based\ncompensation for executive officers. The applicable PSU agreements relating to the annual performance-based compensation\nas entered into with each of Power Integrations’ executive officers provide that PSUs will be treated in the same manner as\ncash for the payments of the target bonus in connection with a Termination Upon Change in Control or Termination of\nEmployment (as defined in the Executive Officer Benefits Agreements). The PSUs deemed vested will be paid in shares of\nPower Integrations’ common stock equal to the number of PSUs deemed vested, and the market value is determined using\n$82.11 per share, the closing price per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market at December 29, 2023, the last trading day of\n2023.\n(6) Reflects the aggregate market value of unvested RSU awards for which vesting would accelerate in such event. The aggregate\nmarket value is computed by multiplying (i) $82.11, the closing price per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on\nDecember 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023, by (ii) the number of unvested awards that would be subject to accelerated\nvesting in such event at December 31, 2023.\n(7) Reflects the aggregate market value of unvested PRSU awards for which vesting would accelerate in such event. The aggregate\nmarket value is computed by multiplying (i) $82.11, the closing price per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on\nDecember 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023, by (ii) the number of unvested awards that would be subject to accelerated\nvesting in such event at December 31, 2023.\n(8) For retirement, upon completion of service and age requirements, health coverage is paid until the age of 65. For severance,\nreflects the cost of health coverage (COBRA) to maintain the benefits currently provided, calculated based upon the rates at\nDecember 31, 2023.\n(9) The total termination benefits received by the Officer for termination within 18 months of a change of control may be lower\nthan what is stated in this table in light of a provision in the Officers’ respective Executive Officers Benefits Agreement which\nstates that if any of the payments and benefits provided under such agreements (the “Payments”) in connection with a change\nof control would result in a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount of such\nPayments will be either (i) the full amount of the Payments or (ii) a reduced amount which would result in no portion of the\nPayments being subject to excise tax (as defined in the respective agreements), whichever amount provides the greatest amount\nof benefit to the Officer.\nThe table above describes potential payments to our Officers in the event of retirement or a change of control as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The table includes the acceleration of outstanding performance stock units in connection with a change of control.\nPolicy on Hedging\nOur Board has adopted a policy that prohibits directors, executive officers and other “insiders” from engaging in short sales,\ntransactions in put or call options, hedging transactions or other inherently speculative transactions with respect to our common stock at\nany time. Further, our employee handbook extends this policy to all of our employees.\n44\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION\nPower Integrations’ Compensation Committee consists of Dr. Arienzo, Mr. Brathwaite and Ms. Gioia. None of the current\nmembers of the Compensation Committee is or has ever been an officer or employee of Power Integrations or its subsidiaries. None of\nPower Integrations’ executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has\none or more executive officers serving as a member of Power Integrations’ Board or Compensation Committee.\nPay Ratio\nThe annual total compensation of the median employee and the annual total compensation of our chief executive officer were\ncalculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Using the methodology described below, our\nCEO’s annual total compensation in 2023 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement was\n$8,218,982 and our median employee’s annual total compensation in 2023 was $98,813. As a result, our 2023 CEO to median employee\npay ratio was approximately 83:1.\nWe chose December 1, 2023 as the date for establishing the employee population used in identifying the median employee and\nused fiscal 2023 the measurement period. We identified the median employee using a consistently applied compensation measure which\nincludes annual base salary or wages, target annual performance-based equity awards based on their grant date fair values, target\ncommissions and target long-term equity awards based on their grant date fair values. Permanent employees who joined in 2023 and\npermanent employees who were on leave during 2023 were assumed to have worked for the entire year. All U.S. and non-U.S. employees\nemployed as of December 1, 2023 were captured. No cost-of-living adjustments were made.\nThis pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our human resources system\nof record and the methodology described above. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and\ncalculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to\napply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio\nreported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment\nand compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their\nown pay ratios.\nPAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE\nThe Compensation Actually Paid, (“CAP”) disclosed below for our Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”) and Non-PEO named\nexecutive officers “Non-PEO NEOs”, which represents the average amounts of all named executive officers excluding our PEO, was\ncalculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K. The CAP figures presented in the table below\nincorporate total executive compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table adjusted for changes in the fair value of\nequity awards and pension benefits. Accordingly, CAP does not equate to the amount that is actually paid to any executive in a given\nyear and is merely a measurement determined by the SEC in an effort to identify the relationship between executive compensation and\na Company’s financial performance.\nThe following table sets forth the CAP to our PEO and average of our Non-PEO NEOs, serving in such capacity, along with\ncertain measures of Company performance in each of the four years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021\nand December 31, 2020:\nSummary Av erage Summary Average Value of I ni tia l Fixed\nCompensation Compensation Compensation Compensation $100 Investment Based on\nTable Actually Paid Table Total for Actually Paid Total Shareholder Peer Group\nTotal to the Non-PEO to Non-PEO Return Total Shareholder (in thousands)\nYear for PEO PEO (1) (2) NEOs NEOs (1) (3) (TSR) - POWI Return (4) Net Income Net Revenues\n2023 ... $ 8,218,982 $ 6,836,603 $ 2,503,959 $ 2,415,342 $ 171.35 $ 238.72 $ 55,735 $ 444,538\n2022 ... $ 7,015,329 $ (13,137,041) $ 1,737,581 $ (725,064) $ 148.28 $ 142.94 $ 170,851 $ 651,138\n2021 ... $ 6,564,685 $ 16,724,842 $ 1,784,763 $ 3,351,766 $ 190.35 $ 219.51 $ 164,413 $ 703,277\n2020 ... $ 5,733,115 $ 23,622,794 $ 1,514,513 $ 4,824,198 $ 166.78 $ 153.66 $ 71,176 $ 488,318\n(1) See supplemental disclosures below for adjustments made to arrive at CAP for PEO and Non-PEO NEOs.\n(2) For fiscal years 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Balu Balakrishnan served as our President and Chief Executive officer.\n(3) For fiscal years 2023, Non-PEO NEOs were Sandeep Nayyar, Radu Barsan, Sunil Gupta and Yang Chiah Yee. For fiscal 2022\nand 2021, Non-PEO NEOs were Sandeep Nayyar, Radu Barsan, Mike Matthews and Yang Chiah Yee. For fiscal year 2020,\nNon-PEO NEOs were Sandeep Nayyar, Radu Barsan, Mike Matthews and Ben Sutherland.\n45\n(4) Peer Group TSR is based on Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX) (the “Industry Index”). SOX is\na market cap weighted index of 30 US-listed semiconductor companies.\nThe following graph shows the relationship between CAP and TSR for both the Company and Industry Index, as represented\nby the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Sector Index. TSR shows the cumulative total return on an investment of $100 in\ncash on December 31, 2019, through December 31, 2023, in our common stock and the Industry Index, assuming that all dividends were\nreinvested. The return shown on the graph below is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and we do not make or endorse\nany predictions as to future stockholder returns.\nThe following graph shows the relationship between CAP and Net Income:\n46\nThe following graph shows the relationship between CAP and Net Revenues:\nThe following are the Company’s three most important performance measures for determining NEO compensation for 2023:\n2023 Performance Measures\nNet Revenues\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nRelative Revenue (1)\n(1) Relative Revenue refers to the Company’s Revenue CAGRs as compared to the Revenue CAGR of the analog semiconductor\nindustry over similar periods. See section “Mechanics of 2023 Performance-based Equity Incentive Awards” above for\nfurther details.\nPay versus Performance Supplemental Disclosures\nAs demonstrated graphically above, the compensation of our named executive officers is structured in a way that closely aligns\ncompensation with overall company performance and further serves to align executive and stockholders’ interests. As described in the\n“Executive Compensation Components” section above, a significant portion of executive compensation is given in the form of RSUs,\nPSUs and PRSUs. That section also describes the performance conditions upon which PSUs and PRSUs are valued and thresholds which\nultimately determine the number of shares that would vest. For purposes of calculating CAP, the fair value of stock awards is driven by\nchanges in the Company’s stock price and in the case of performance-based awards, changes in the expected achievement of the\nperformance targets.\nThe below table shows the reconciliation between amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table to arrive at CAP for\nour PEO.\nSummary Exclusion of Exclusion of Inclusion of Inclusion of Compensation\nCompensation Change in Stock Pension Service Equity Actually\nTable Total for Pension Value for Awards for Cost for Values for Paid to\nYear PEO PEO PEO PEO PEO (1) PEO\n2023 .............. $ 8,218,982 — $ 7,497,159 — $ 6,114,780 $ 6,836,603\n2022 .............. $ 7,015,329 — $ 6,310,294 — $ (13,842,076) $ (13,137,041)\n2021 .............. $ 6,564,685 — $ 5,890,071 — $ 16,050,228 $ 16,724,842\n2020 .............. $ 5,733,115 — $ 5,080,867 — $ 22,970,546 $ 23,622,794\n(1) As calculated in table below for Total – Inclusion of Equity Values PEO.\n47\nThe below table shows the reconciliation between amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table to arrive at CAP on\naverage for our Non-PEO NEOs.\nAverage Average Average Average Average Average\nSummary Exclusion of Exclusion of Inclusion of Inclusion of Compensation\nCompensation Change in Stock Pension Service Equity Actually\nTable Total Pension Value for Awards for Cost for Values for Paid to\nYear Non-PEO NEOs Non-PEO NEOs Non-PEO NEOs Non-PEO NEOs Non-PEO NEOs (1) Non-PEO NEOs\n2023 .............. $ 2,503,959 — $ 2,080,893 — $ 1,992,276 $ 2,415,342\n2022 .............. $ 1,737,581 — $ 1,325,853 — $ (1,136,792) $ (725,064)\n2021 .............. $ 1,784,763 — $ 1,415,573 — $ 2,982,576 $ 3,351,766\n2020 .............. $ 1,514,513 — $ 1,145,772 — $ 4,455,457 $ 4,824,198\n(1) As calculated in table below for Total - Average Inclusion of Equity Values Non-PEO NEOs.\nThe fair value of our equity awards is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718-10, Stock Compensation.\nTime-vested restricted stock unit grant date fair values are calculated using the stock price as of date of grant.

Net revenues for the third quarter were $115.8 million, up nine percent from the prior quarter and down eight percent from the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $14.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to $0.09 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $0.34 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $32.9 million. \n\nIn addition to its GAAP results, the company provided non-GAAP measures that exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the related tax effects. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $22.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared to $0.28 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results is included with the tables accompanying this press release. \n\nCommented Balu Balakrishnan, chairman and CEO of Power Integrations: “Our third-quarter results were on target, and while our outlook reflects soft end-market demand, particularly in consumer appliances, we nevertheless expect double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In light of our strong balance sheet, our board of directors has authorized $50 million for share repurchases and increased our quarterly dividend by five percent. \n\n“Progress on our PowiGaN™ technology roadmap continues apace, with the introduction earlier this week of the world’s first 1700-volt gallium-nitride transistors in our InnoMux™-2 product family. As PowiGaN technology reaches ever-higher voltage and power capabilities, it becomes an increasingly attractive, lower-cost alternative to silicon carbide. At the same time, its cost is approaching parity with the most advanced high-voltage silicon MOSFETs, but with far superior performance.” \n\n**Additional Highlights**\n\n  * Power Integrations’ board of directors has authorized the use of $50 million for the repurchase of the company’s common shares, subject to pre-determined price/volume thresholds. The authorization does not have an expiration date. \n  * The company paid a dividend of $0.20 per share on September 30, 2024; a dividend of $0.21 per share will be paid on December 31, 2024, to stockholders of record as of November 29, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Financial Outlook**\n\nThe company issued the following forecast for the fourth quarter of 2024: \n\n  * Revenues are expected to be $105 million plus or minus $5 million. \n  * GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 54 percent and 54.5 percent, and non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 55 percent and 55.5 percent. The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins is approximately equally attributable to stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. \n  * GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $53.5 million and $54 million; non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be between $44.5 million and $45 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to exclude approximately $9 million of stock-based compensation. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time**\n\nPower Integrations management will hold a conference call today at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time. A live webcast of the call will be available on the investor section of the company's website, [ _http://investors.power.com_ ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.power.com&esheet=54148291&newsitemid=20241106320623&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.power.com&index=2&md5=8e23368341358dab38327d9c935bb658).

The company’s products are key building blocks in the clean-power ecosystem, enabling the generation of renewable energy as well as the efficient transmission and consumption of power in applications ranging from milliwatts to megawatts. For more information, please visit [ _www.power.com_ ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.power.com&esheet=54148291&newsitemid=20241106320623&lan=en-US&anchor=www.power.com&index=5&md5=18a6af4803a3abd191640fce71107b3c). \n\n**Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the company's consolidated financial statements, which are presented according to GAAP, the company provides certain non-GAAP financial information that excludes stock-based compensation expenses recorded under ASC 718-10, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and the tax effects of these items. The company uses these measures in its financial and operational decision-making and, with respect to one measure, in setting performance targets for compensation purposes. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures offer important analytical tools to help investors understand its operating results, and to facilitate comparability with the results of companies that provide similar measures. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. For example, stock-based compensation is an important component of the company’s compensation mix and will continue to result in significant expenses in the company’s GAAP results for the foreseeable future but is not reflected in the non-GAAP measures. Also, other companies, including companies in Power Integrations’ industry, may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are attached to this press release. \n\n**Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThe above statements regarding the company’s forecast for its fourth-quarter financial performance are forward-looking statements reflecting management's current expectations and beliefs. These statements are based on current information that is, by its nature, subject to rapid and even abrupt change. Due to risks and uncertainties associated with the company's business, actual results could differ materially from those projected or implied by these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the company’s ability to supply products and its ability to conduct other aspects of its business such as competing for new design wins; changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, including such factors as inflation, armed conflicts and trade negotiations, which may impact the level of demand for the company’s products; potential changes and shifts in customer demand away from end products that utilize the company's integrated circuits to end products that do not incorporate the company's products; the effects of competition, which may cause the company’s revenues to decrease or cause the company to decrease its selling prices for its products; unforeseen costs and expenses; and unfavorable fluctuations in component costs or operating expenses resulting from changes in commodity prices and/or exchange rates. In addition, new product introductions and design wins are subject to the risks and uncertainties that typically accompany development and delivery of complex technologies to the marketplace, including product development delays and defects and market acceptance of the new products. These and other risk factors that may cause actual results to differ are more fully explained under the caption “Risk Factors” in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 12, 2024. The company is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any obligation) to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. \n\n_Power Integrations, PowiGaN, InnoMux and the Power Integrations logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Power Integrations, Inc.

Each output is regulated within one percent accuracy, eliminating post regulators and further improving system efficiency by approximately ten percent. The new device replaces expensive silicon carbide (SiC) transistors in power supply applications such as automotive chargers, solar inverters, three-phase meters and a wide variety of industrial power systems. \n\nRadu Barsan, vice president of technology at Power Integrations, said, “Our rapid pace of GaN development has delivered three world-first voltage ratings in a span of less than two years: 900 V, 1250 V and now 1700 V. Our new InnoMux-2 ICs combine 1700 V GaN and three other recent innovations: independent, accurate, multi-output regulation; FluxLink™, our secondary-side regulation (SSR) digital isolation communications technology; and zero voltage switching (ZVS) without an active-clamp, which all but eliminates switching losses.” \n\n“1700 V rating is substantially higher than any other commercially available GaN HEMT that we are aware of,” said Ezgi Dogmus, activity manager, compound semiconductors at [Yole Group](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Furl.us.m.mimecastprotect.com%2Fs%2F9IULCYENkrUDNjMnT0fGFxFk5h%3Fdomain%3Dyolegroup.com%2F&esheet=54146225&newsitemid=20241104193507&lan=en-US&anchor=Yole+Group&index=6&md5=2013902ef1b792e3482da66099c414d8). “The Power GaN device market is poised to reach $2 billion by decade's end, expanding across various application spaces with potentially attractive cost advantages over SiC.” (1) \n\n** Availability & Resources **\n\nPricing for [InnoMux-2 1700 V](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.power.com%2Fproducts%2Finnomux%2Finnomux2-ep%3Futm_campaign%3D1700V_InnoMux-2_PowiGaN%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_source%3DPI%26utm_content%3DProduct%26utm_term%3DAC-DC%2BInnoMux-2%2BMulti-Ouput%2BPI%2BEN&esheet=54146225&newsitemid=20241104193507&lan=en-US&anchor=InnoMux-2+1700+V&index=7&md5=a8addc0a960ed563a0f90e7e95307a99) ICs starts at $4.90 for 10,000-unit quantities.
