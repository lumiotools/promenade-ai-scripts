The third quarter marked our second consecutive quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA and operating profit. Not only did we see growth in product revenue compared to the previous quarter, but we also experienced a more than doubling of product gross margins, primarily due to improved utilization and scale at our manufacturing site,” said Robert Wessman, Chairman and CEO of Alvotech. “We are also pleased with the steady progress of our pipeline, which included multiple filing acceptances in Europe and the initiation of our confirmatory clinical study for AVT16, our proposed biosimilar to Entyvio. The continued execution of our research and development activities not only contributes to our topline through milestone revenues but also provides further opportunities for the company to grow and diversify in the future.”\n\n**Product development highlights**\n\nAlvotech announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for AVT03, a proposed biosimilar to Prolia® and Xgeva® (denosumab) and an MAA for AVT05, a proposed biosimilar to Simponi® (golimumab). For European markets, Alvotech has partnership agreements for commercialization of AVT03 with STADA and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and for AVT05 with Advanz Pharma.\n\nAlvotech announced the initiation of a confirmatory patient study for AVT16, a proposed biosimilar to Entyvio® (vedolizumab). Entyvio, which generated approximately $5.4 billion in global sales in the twelve months until June 30, 2024 [1], is used to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease [2].\n\nAlvotech and Teva Pharmaceuticals announced that the U.S. FDA has approved a new presentation of SELARSDI™ (ustekinumab-aekn), a biosimilar to Stelara® (ustekinumab), in a 130 mg/26 mL single-dose vial for intravenous infusion. This approval also expands SELARSDI's label to include treatment for adults with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, aligning it with the reference product's indications. The U.S. launch of SELARSDI is expected in February 2025.\n\n**Summary of the Financial Results for First Nine Months of 2024**\n\n _Cash position and sources of liquidity:_ As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $118.3 million. In addition, the Company had borrowings of $1,028.2 million, including $22.2 million of current portion of borrowings.\n\n_Product Revenue:_ Product revenue was $128.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $29.8 million for the same nine months of 2023. Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of product revenue from sales of AVT02 in select European countries and Canada, launch of AVT02 in the U.S., and launch of AVT04 in Canada, Japan and select European markets.\n\n_License and Other Revenue:_ License and other revenue was $210.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $8.2 million for the same nine months of 2023. The license and other revenue of $210.5 million was primarily attributable to the recognition of a $6.6 million research and development milestone due to the approval of AVT04 in Europe, $16.8 million relative to research and development milestone due to the commencement of a clinical phase for the AVT16 program, $22.3 million due to the MAA submission for AVT03 and AVT06, and $95.6 million due to the Confirmatory Efficacy and Safety (CES) trial completion of AVT03 and AVT05. This also included $41.1 million of performance milestone relative to the product launch of AVT04 in Japan and Europe, the achievement of sales target of AVT02 in Europe and Canada, and the product launch of AVT02 in the U.S., and a net milestone revenue of $26.4 million for the execution of out-license contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n_Cost of product revenue:_ Cost of product revenue was $105.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $104.4 million for the same nine months of 2023, as a result of sales in the period, including the launch of AVT02 in the U.S., AVT04 in Canada, Japan and select European countries tempered by lower production-related charges and lower costs associated with FDA inspection readiness.\n\n_Research and development (R &D) expenses: _R&D expenses were $131.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $152.8 million for the same nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a one-time charge of $18.5 million relating to the termination of the co-development agreement with Biosana for AVT23 recognized during the nine months of 2023, a decrease of $4.3 million primarily related to programs which have completed clinical phase (i.e., AVT02 and AVT04 programs), a decrease of $6.0 million related to programs for which the clinical phase is substantially completed (i.e. AVT03, AVT05, and AVT06), and overall lower headcount and other R&D expenses of $11.4 million, partially offset by a $17.4 million increase in direct program expenses mainly due to AVT16 that is in clinical phase.\n\n_General and administrative (G &A) expenses:_ G&A expenses were $46.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $58.6 million for the same nine months of 2023. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily attributable to $6.6 million in lower third-party services, lower insurance premiums and less headcount, coupled with a $4.6 million decrease in expenses for share-based payments.\n\n_Operating profit:_ Operating profit was $56.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to ($277.7) million for the same nine months of 2023. The increase of $333.9 million was primarily attributable to the sharp increase in total revenues due to a combination of expansion of our product launches and milestones recognition for advancing our product through our pipeline and achieving contractual sales targets. This is coupled with a decrease in operating expenses driven by continuing efforts by the Company to scale and rationalize operations.\n\n_Share of net loss of joint venture and loss on interest in joint venture:_ In June 2024, Alvotech sold its share in the joint venture for gross proceeds of $18.0 million (less $1.3 million in transaction costs). The sale resulted in a net loss of $3.0 million during the nine months ended 30 September 2024.\n\n_Finance income:_ Finance income was $79.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $46.4 million for the same nine months of 2023. Finance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to the change in fair value of the Tranche A Conversion Feature of the 2022 Convertible bonds impacted by the bond holders exercising their right to conversion into ordinary shares on the last scheduled conversion date prior to maturity, which was July 1, 2024. The Finance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was mainly attributable to a favorable change in fair value of the Predecessors Earn Out shares.\n\n_Finance costs:_ Finance costs were $237.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $107.8 million for the same nine months of 2023. The Finance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily comprised of a $107.3 million change in fair value of the Predecessors Earn Out shares, which was negatively impacted by the increase in the Company's share price during that period, and by interest charges on outstanding debts of $115.0 million.\n\n_Exchange rate differences:_ Exchange rate differences resulted in a gain of $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gain of $0.9 million for the same nine months of 2023. The change was primarily driven by the movements in the exchange rate of the dollar against other currencies, predominantly Icelandic krona and euros.\n\n_Loss on extinguishment of financial liabilities:_ On June 7, 2024, the Company entered into a $965.0 million Facility, maturing in July 2029, that was funded in July 2024. Upon the closing of the Facility, the Company was required to settle its existing debt obligations. In parallel, the Company announced that all holders of the Tranche A and some holders of the Tranche B of the 2022 Convertible Bonds exercised their right to conversion into ordinary shares at the fixed conversion price of $10.00 per share on the last scheduled conversion date prior to maturity, which is July 1, 2024. Similarly, some holders of the Aztiq Convertible Bonds decided to exercise similar conversion right into ordinary shares at the same conversion price. A loss on extinguishment of financial liabilities of $69.0 million related to the refinancing of existing debt obligations, including the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Bonds and Aztiq Convertible Bonds, was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n_Income tax benefit:_ Income tax benefit was $8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a benefit of $67.1 million for the same nine months of 2023. The decrease in benefit was mainly driven by a decrease of $61.1 million in deferred tax credit corresponding to lower operating losses and a $4.2 million decrease in foreign currency impact on the strengthening of the Icelandic Krona against the U.S. Dollar, increasing the U.S. Dollar value of Icelandic tax loss carry-forwards that Alvotech expects to utilize against future taxable profits. The decrease in income tax benefit is partly offset by an increase in other permanent differences of approximately $7.0 million.\n\n_Loss for the Period:_ Reported net loss was $164.9 million, or ($0.63) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a reported net loss of $275.2 million, or ($1.21) per share on a basic and diluted basis, for the same nine months of 2023. As mentioned above, the net loss for the period is heavily impacted by the non-cash fair value charges associated with our derivative liabilities and the impact of the refinancing of the existing debt obligations.\n\n**Business Update Conference Call** Alvotech will conduct a business update conference call and live webcast on Thursday, November 14, at 8:00 am ET (13:00 pm GMT).

Biosimiliarity has not been established by regulatory authorities and is not claimed.\n\n**About AVT04 (ustekinumab)** AVT04 is a monoclonal antibody and a biosimilar to Stelara® (ustekinumab). Ustekinumab binds to two cytokines, IL-12 and IL-23, that are involved in inflammatory and immune responses [4]. AVT04 has been launched in Canada as JAMTEKI, in the EEA as UZPRUVO, and in Japan as USTEKINUMAB BS (F). It has been approved in the U.S. as SELARSDI (ustekinumab-aekn). Dossiers are also under review in multiple countries globally.\n\n**About AVT06/AVT29** AVT06/AVT29 is a recombinant fusion protein and a biosimilar candidate to Eylea® (aflibercept) 2 mg and 8 mg dose, which binds vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), inhibiting the binding and activation of VEGF receptors, neovascularization, and vascular permeability [5]. AVT06/AVT29 are investigational products and have not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimilarity has not been established by regulatory authorities and is not claimed.\n\n**About AVT16** AVT16 is a human monoclonal antibody and a biosimilar candidate to Entyvio® (vedolizumab). AVT16 is an investigational product and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimiliarity has not been established by regulatory authorities and is not claimed.\n\n**Sources**[1] IQVIA [2] [Entyvio product information](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RBgeX-O7yNiSUpYBc3T6rl6TmgyDIBHcZlGOKqIhUDE5irNQS1IG6plinUL-4l3sZONfiJvLKIQR2KuvWoGTDLHXC1YDB0-jZ9UrSIiuwRgKcF688uNIlDBDw0xCpJScctYhFC_m3AsH_oPcLcBKTCWPz-2bBe_Ev2ltZNDsAe6Yx_UFGn7uGHoccalGyOW8E0G9WA-0v2bnT1tyEKcp9Q==)[3] [Prolia product information](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4JM6IpkuPijlM-KuJpwzWWwc-WHz0CWaaM6m-2rpF0hYbgB3161gPP_8GtwD19Kz1-Uz0td0uajxsHgezO-Bsj6Ww61QpHTmA2CCngYHRKLUkYRuE3x_YpGPxBECh_GxjwrB3JODXYgNSyouM03ahsCQBgOG5fjD6PHHB2lRBpunq2yBxH6A73QlgYC2LdQe)[4] [Uzpruvo product information](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9QFCmkcY4Tc-y2Edk0zvhsy3WIRYxoyLpMwAW59KrL9a0NP55lp9qifFK9MagXxn_PpYzF2NQ3ukUIZQ2JCAtJzplAAiS6GMywTV_ZPpFbkSuoPnyGTh4UxkrZICR3vZ_qoeJXegNe2YwHtWordQgbPFiMlH6Id4EfvZSil4y6MaX5783YnNh-2Nv1nb8nLP3YH1AObkR_7YytO9Y6vaKA==) [5] [Eylea product information](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZzmDAY31w0vP3G2JDRSRnBPiX6Y8zLKMZsByvpeONrQQ03WCSQgwC2oImoLp2uiVDvaiyFxEfC6rbiTQQD3VxwLuM1ZZDZeSOCe3VCnxmZKJ_y3zAqg_-lrSOXYGmT0l-FyZz3Ni-iRbGrXLerEmtw==)\n\n**Use of trademarks** Humira is a registered trademark of AbbVie Inc.

This is believed to be the first marketing authorization application filing announced globally for a biosimilar candidate to Simponi. The approvals process is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n\"This is a welcome milestone for us, our partners, patients and caregivers, as we take one step closer to being able to offer access to biosimilar Simponi®,\" said Joseph McClellan, Chief Scientific Officer of Alvotech. “We believe having the capability and know-how inhouse to utilize a host cell line and process also used to manufacture the reference biologic, has given us an important head start in developing a biosimilar candidate to Simponi®.\"\n\n“The EMA’s acceptance of the application for AVT05 represents a significant step forward in expanding treatment options for patients with chronic inflammatory diseases across Europe,” said Nick Warwick, Chief Medical Officer of Advanz Pharma. “We are committed to improving patient access to high-quality biologic medicines.”\n\nAlvotech and Advanz Pharma first announced in February 2023 that the companies had entered into a commercialization agreement, for AVT23, a proposed biosimilar to Xolair® (omalizumab). In May 2024, the partners announced an expansion of the strategic partnership, to include five additional biosimilar candidates being developed by Alvotech, AVT05, AVT16 a proposed biosimilar to Entyvio® (vedolizumab) and three additional early-stage biosimilar candidates which remain undisclosed. In June 2024, the partners announced that they had entered into a commercialization agreement for AVT06, a proposed biosimilar to Eylea® low dose (2 mg) and AVT29, a biosimilar candidate for Eylea® high dose (8 mg). \n\nIn April 2024 Alvotech announced positive top-line results from a confirmatory clinical study comparing efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity between AVT05 and Simponi® in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In November 2023, Alvotech announced positive topline results from a pharmacokinetic study which assessed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of AVT05 compared to Simponi® in healthy adult participants.\n\n**About AVT05** AVT05 is a biosimilar candidate for Simponi® and Simponi Aria® (golimumab). Golimumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Elevated TNF alpha levels have been implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis [1]. AVT05 is an investigational product and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimilarity has not been established by regulatory authorities and is not claimed.\n\n**About AVT16** AVT16 is a human monoclonal antibody and a biosimilar candidate to Entyvio® (vedolizumab). AVT16 is an investigational product and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimiliarity has not been established by regulatory authorities and is not claimed.\n\n**About AVT06/AVT29** AVT06/AVT29 is a recombinant fusion protein and a biosimilar candidate to Eylea® (aflibercept), which binds vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), inhibiting the binding and activation of VEGF receptors, neovascularization, and vascular permeability [2]. AVT06/AVT29 is an investigational product and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimilarity has not been established by regulatory authorities and is not claimed.\n\n**About AVT23** AVT23 is a monoclonal antibody and proposed biosimilar to Xolair® (omalizumab). AVT23 is an investigational compound and has not received regulatory approval in any country. Biosimilarity has not been established by regulatory authorities and is not claimed.\n\n**Sources**[1] EMA, Simponi product information \n\n[2] EMA, Eylea product information\n\n**Use of trademarks** Simponi® is a registered trademark of Johnson & Johnson.
