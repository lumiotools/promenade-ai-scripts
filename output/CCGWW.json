For further information on the non-GAAP financial measures presented above, see the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below._ _(2) The rapid growth of the NEV market has created new opportunities for auto insurance offerings and propelled revenue growth of auto insurance providers. Cheche started collaborating with NEV manufacturers in 2022, which yielded considerable results in 2023. Cheche believes that the further development of the NEV market and the introduction of innovative NEV auto insurance solutions will further fuel the revenue contribution of its partnership with NEV manufacturers. The management of Cheche utilizes the number of partnerships with NEV manufacturers, the number of insurance policies embedded in the new NEV deliveries, and the number of corresponding premiums generated from such embedded policies as the primary operating metrics to evaluate its business. It presents such operating metrics for investors to better understand and assess Cheche's business._  \n---  \n  \n**Management Comments**\n\n\"We are proud to announce that Cheche reported net income profitability for the first time on both a GAAP and adjusted net income basis. This quarter's milestone substantiates the merit of our business model and the growing conviction in our value proposition,\" said Lei Zhang, Founder, CEO, and Chairman of Cheche Group. \"We continue to work with both NEV manufacturers and insurers to leverage advanced data analysis, delivering tools that will reward responsible drivers, reduce fraud, and bring efficiencies to claims processing to support profitability, transparency, and affordability as the transition to automated mobility accelerates.\n\nMr. Zhang continued, \"With China producing 48% more NEVs in September over the prior year, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, and NEV sales again surpassing traditional fuel car sales in the same month, our innovative platform will continue to meet the evolving insurance needs of car owners, manufacturers, and insurers.\"\n\n**Unaudited Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Net Revenues** were RMB850.5 million (US$121.2 million), representing a 3.3% year-over-year increase from the prior-year quarter. The growth was driven by increased insurance transactions conducted through Cheche's platform by referral and third-party platform partners.\n\n**Cost of Revenues** increased 3.0% year-over-year to RMB808.1 million (US$115.2 million) from the prior-year quarter, consistent with the growth of business volume and net revenues.\n\n**Selling and Marketing Expenses** decreased 53.6% to RMB18.1 million (US$2.6 million) from RMB39.0 million in the prior-year quarter, mainly due to the decrease in share-based compensation expenses and staff cost. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, selling and marketing expenses were RMB17.4 million (US$2.5 million), a decrease of 6.5% compared to the prior-year quarter.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses** decreased 41.3% to RMB20.4 million (US$2.9 million) from RMB34.8 million for the prior-year quarter, mainly due to the decrease in share-based compensation and professional service fees. Excluding share-based compensation and listing-related professional service fees, general and administrative expenses increased by RMB3.5 million from RMB15.0 million to RMB18.5 million (US$2.6 million), primarily due to the increase of post-listing professional service fees. \n\n**Research and Development Expenses** decreased 24.5% to RMB10.2 million (US$1.4 million) from RMB13.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The change was mainly due to decreased share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by the increase of staff costs. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, research and development expenses decreased 8.8% to RMB9.8 million (US$1.4 million) from RMB10.8 million in the prior-year quarter.\n\n**Total Cost and Operating Expenses** decreased by 1.8% to RMB856.8 million (US$122.1 million) from RMB872.0 million in the prior-year quarter, mainly due to the increased cost of revenues and the decrease in share-based compensation expenses. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition and listing-related professional service fees, total cost and operating expenses increased by 3.0% from the prior-year quarter.\n\n**Net****Income** for the quarter was RMB4.1 million (US$0.6 million), compared to a net loss of RMB55.4 million for the prior-year quarter. Excluding non-GAAP expenses, the **Adjusted Net****Income****(1)** for the quarter was RMB2.6 million (US$0.4 million), due to the improvement of operating results and the positive impact from foreign exchange rates, compared to an adjusted net loss of RMB0.6 million for the prior-year quarter. \n\n**Net****Income****attributable to Cheche's shareholders** was RMB4.1 million (US$0.6 million), compared to a net loss attributable to Cheche's shareholders of RMB707.6 million for the prior-year quarter.\n\n**Adjusted Net I****ncome****attributable to Cheche's shareholders** was RMB2.6 million (US$0.4 million), compared to an adjusted net loss attributable to Cheche's shareholders of RMB652.7 million for the prior-year quarter.\n\n**Net Income Per Share** , basic and diluted, was RMB0.05 (US$0.01), compared to a net loss per share of RMB17.52, basic and diluted, for the prior-year quarter.\n\n**Adjusted Net****Income****Per Share,** basic and diluted, was RMB0.03 (US$0.00), compared to an adjusted net loss per share of RMB16.16, basic and diluted, for the prior-year quarter.\n\n**3Q24 and Subsequent B****usiness Highlights**\n\n  * On September 3, 2024, Cheche announced a partnership with Shanghai Jidu Automobile Company Limited (\"JI YUE\") to further diversify its partner network with leaders in the NEV industry. Cheche successfully launched a system for JI YUE, creating channels for online and offline purchasing of auto and non-auto insurance products. The system is integrated into Cheche's core platform and is equipped with resources to grow and strengthen JI YUE's sales channels and enhance account settlement capabilities, among other functionalities.\n  * On September 12, 2024, Cheche announced a partnership with Laoyou Insurance Brokerage Co., Ltd. (\"Laoyou Insurance\"), a wholly controlled subsidiary of Great Wall Motor Company Limited (\"GWM\"), a top ten Chinese auto manufacturer. Cheche's insurance solutions and mature transaction system have been gradually rolled out with GWM's newly established direct-sales network in more than 20 cities nationwide. Cheche plans to develop a comprehensive insurance solution tailored for traditional automakers within one to two years.\n  * On October 1, 2024, Cheche announced a strategic partnership with The Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Company (China) Limited (\"TMNCH\"), as Cheche continues to broaden its collaborations with insurance companies in China. Leveraging each other's strengths, the two companies are working to develop specialized insurance products, services, and sales strategies. Cheche's agreement with TMNCH is two pronged. This collaboration will enhance Cheche's insurance service capabilities while offering increased scale for traditional automotive companies and pave the way for future partnerships with Japanese automotive companies.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had RMB194.6 million (US$27.7 million) in total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nCheche is affirming its full-year 2024 outlook:\n\n  * Net Revenues are expected to range from RMB3.5 billion to RMB3.7 billion, representing an increase of 6.1% to 12.1%, compared to the full year of 2023.\n  * Total written premiums placed are expected to range from RMB24.5 billion to RMB26.5 billion, representing an increase of 8.4% to 17.3%, compared to the full year of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nCheche will host a webcast and conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 results today at 8:00 a.m. EST.

(previously named Fanhua Times Sales and Service Co., Ltd), listing-related professional service fees and dispute resolution expenses, representing expenses Cheche incurred in a dispute with a certain security holder. Cheche defines adjusted net loss/income as net loss/income adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and changes in fair value of amounts due to a related party related to the acquisition of Cheche Insurance Sales & Services Co., Ltd. (previously named Fanhua Times Sales and Service Co., Ltd), change in fair value of warrants, listing related professional service fees and dispute resolution expenses. Adjusted net loss/income per share, basic and diluted, is calculated as adjusted net loss/income divided by weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding.\n\nCheche believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition, and change in fair value of amounts due to a related party associated with the acquisition of Cheche Insurance Sales & Services Co., Ltd. (previously named Fanhua Times Sales and Service Co., Ltd), change in fair value of warrants, and listing related professional service fees and dispute resolution expenses. Cheche believes that such non-GAAP financial measures also provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP nor presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to net loss /income or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of Cheche's operating performance. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data. Cheche encourages investors and others to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Investors are encouraged to compare the historical non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Cheche mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating its performance.\n\n**Safe Harbor****Statements**\n\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(NASDAQ: CCG) (\"Cheche\", the \"Company\" or \"we\"), China's leading auto insurance\ntechnology platform, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nNet Revenues for the quarter increased 3.3% year-over-year to RMB850.5 million (US$121.2 million), while net revenues for the first nine\nmonths of 2024 increased 2.3% over the comparable prior year period to RMB2.5 billion (US$354.8 million).\nNet Income for the quarter was RMB4.1 million (US$0.6 million), compared to a net loss of RMB55.4 million for the prior-year quarter, while\nnet loss for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 60.2% to RMB50.8 million (US$7.2 million) over the prior-year period.\nAdjusted Net Income (1) for the quarter was RMB2.6 million (US$0.4 million), compared to an adjusted net loss of RMB0.6 million for the\nprior-year quarter, while adjusted net loss for the first nine months of 2024 decreased 23.0% to RMB21.8 million (US$3.1 million), compared to\nthe prior-year period.\nTotal written premiums placed for the quarter increased 4.0% to RMB5.9 billion (US$0.8 billion) compared to the prior-year period, while\ntotal written premiums placed for the first nine months of 2024 increased 4.1% over the comparable prior-year period to RMB16.9 billion\n(US$2.4 billion).\nTotal number of policies issued for the quarter increased 5.0% to 4.2 million from 4.0 million for the prior-year quarter, while the total\nnumber of policies issued over the first nine months of 2024 increased 11.9% over the comparable prior-year period to 12.2 million.\nPartnerships with New Energy Vehicle (NEV) companies (2) numbered 14 in the quarter and led to 292,000 embedded policies with\ncorresponding written premium of RMB884.2 million (US$126.0 million), representing an increase of 149.6% and 121.6 % compared to the\nprior-year quarter, respectively. Embedded policies and corresponding written premium for the first nine months of 2024 reached 636,000\nand RMB1.9 billion (US$273.2 million), respectively, representing growth of 144.6 % for policies embedded and 104.2% for written premium\ncompared to the prior-year period.\n(1) Adjusted Net Loss/Income is a non-GAAP measure. For further information on the non-GAAP financial measures presented above, see the\n\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section below.\n(2) The rapid growth of the NEV market has created new opportunities for auto insurance offerings and propelled revenue growth of auto\ninsurance providers. Cheche started collaborating with NEV manufacturers in 2022, which yielded considerable results in 2023. Cheche believes\nthat the further development of the NEV market and the introduction of innovative NEV auto insurance solutions will further fuel the revenue\ncontribution of its partnership with NEV manufacturers. The management of Cheche utilizes the number of partnerships with NEV manufacturers,\nthe number of insurance policies embedded in the new NEV deliveries, and the number of corresponding premiums generated from such\nembedded policies as the primary operating metrics to evaluate its business. It presents such operating metrics for investors to better understand\nand assess Cheche's business.\nManagement Comments\n\"We are proud to announce that Cheche reported net income profitability for the first time on both a GAAP and adjusted net income basis. This\nquarter's milestone substantiates the merit of our business model and the growing conviction in our value proposition,\" said Lei Zhang, Founder,\nCEO, and Chairman of Cheche Group. \"We continue to work with both NEV manufacturers and insurers to leverage advanced data analysis,\ndelivering tools that will reward responsible drivers, reduce fraud, and bring efficiencies to claims processing to support profitability, transparency,\nand affordability as the transition to automated mobility accelerates.\nMr. Zhang continued, \"With China producing 48% more NEVs in September over the prior year, according to China Association of Automobile\nManufacturers, and NEV sales again surpassing traditional fuel car sales in the same month, our innovative platform will continue to meet the\nevolving insurance needs of car owners, manufacturers, and insurers.\"\nUnaudited Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nNet Revenues were RMB850.5 million (US$121.2 million), representing a 3.3% year-over-year increase from the prior-year quarter. The growth\nwas driven by increased insurance transactions conducted through Cheche's platform by referral and third-party platform partners.\nCost of Revenues increased 3.0% year-over-year to RMB808.1 million (US$115.2 million) from the prior-year quarter, consistent with the growth\nof business volume and net revenues.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses decreased 53.6% to RMB18.1 million (US$2.6 million) from RMB39.0 million in the prior-year quarter, mainly\ndue to the decrease in share-based compensation expenses and staff cost. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, selling and marketing\nexpenses were RMB17.4 million (US$2.5 million), a decrease of 6.5% compared to the prior-year quarter.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses decreased 41.3% to RMB20.4 million (US$2.9 million) from RMB34.8 million for the prior-year quarter,\nmainly due to the decrease in share-based compensation and professional service fees. Excluding share-based compensation and listing-related\nprofessional service fees, general and administrative expenses increased by RMB3.5 million from RMB15.0 million to RMB18.5 million (US$2.6\nmillion), primarily due to the increase of post-listing professional service fees.\nResearch and Development Expenses decreased 24.5% to RMB10.2 million (US$1.4 million) from RMB13.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The\nchange was mainly due to decreased share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by the increase of staff costs. Excluding share-based\ncompensation expenses, research and development expenses decreased 8.8% to RMB9.8 million (US$1.4 million) from RMB10.8 million in the\nprior-year quarter.\nTotal Cost and Operating Expenses decreased by 1.8% to RMB856.8 million (US$122.1 million) from RMB872.0 million in the prior-year\nquarter, mainly due to the increased cost of revenues and the decrease in share-based compensation expenses. Excluding share-based\ncompensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition and listing-related professional service fees, total cost and\noperating expenses increased by 3.0% from the prior-year quarter.\nNet Income for the quarter was RMB4.1 million (US$0.6 million), compared to a net loss of RMB55.4 million for the prior-year quarter. Excluding\nnon-GAAP expenses, the Adjusted Net Income (1) for the quarter was RMB2.6 million (US$0.4 million), due to the improvement of operating\nresults and the positive impact from foreign exchange rates, compared to an adjusted net loss of RMB0.6 million for the prior-year quarter.\nNet Income attributable to Cheche's shareholders was RMB4.1 million (US$0.6 million), compared to a net loss attributable to Cheche's\nshareholders of RMB707.6 million for the prior-year quarter.\nAdjusted Net Income attributable to Cheche's shareholders was RMB2.6 million (US$0.4 million), compared to an adjusted net loss\nattributable to Cheche's shareholders of RMB652.7 million for the prior-year quarter.\nNet Income Per Share, basic and diluted, was RMB0.05 (US$0.01), compared to a net loss per share of RMB17.52, basic and diluted, for the\nprior-year quarter.\nAdjusted Net Income Per Share, basic and diluted, was RMB0.03 (US$0.00), compared to an adjusted net loss per share of RMB16.16, basic\nand diluted, for the prior-year quarter.\n3Q24 and Subsequent Business Highlights\nOn September 3, 2024, Cheche announced a partnership with Shanghai Jidu Automobile Company Limited (\"JI YUE\") to further diversify its\npartner network with leaders in the NEV industry.

(previously named\nFanhua Times Sales and Service Co., Ltd), listing-related professional service fees and dispute resolution expenses, representing expenses Cheche\nincurred in a dispute with a certain security holder. Cheche defines adjusted net loss/income as net loss/income adjusted for the impact of share-\nbased compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, and changes in fair value of amounts due to a related party related to the\nacquisition of Cheche Insurance Sales & Services Co., Ltd. (previously named Fanhua Times Sales and Service Co., Ltd), change in fair value of\nwarrants, listing related professional service fees and dispute resolution expenses. Adjusted net loss/income per share, basic and diluted, is\ncalculated as adjusted net loss/income divided by weighted-average ordinary shares outstanding.\nCheche believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the\nimpact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition, and change in fair value of amounts due to\na related party associated with the acquisition of Cheche Insurance Sales & Services Co., Ltd. (previously named Fanhua Times Sales and Service\nCo., Ltd), change in fair value of warrants, and listing related professional service fees and dispute resolution expenses. Cheche believes that such\nnon-GAAP financial measures also provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past\nperformance and future prospects, and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and\noperational decision-making.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP nor presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They should not be considered in\nisolation or construed as alternatives to net loss /income or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of Cheche's operating\nperformance. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nOther companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to the Company's data.\nCheche encourages investors and others to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nInvestors are encouraged to compare the historical non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Cheche\nmitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which\nshould be considered when evaluating its performance.\nSafe Harbor Statements\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995.
