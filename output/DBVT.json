The Company anticipates that the ADS Ratio Change will be effective on or about November 29, 2024 (the “Effective Date”).\n\nFor the Company’s ADS holders, the change in the ADS Ratio will have the same effect as a one-for-five reverse ADS split and is intended to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. On the Effective Date, registered holders of the Company’s ADSs held in certificated form will be required on a mandatory basis to surrender their certificated ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation and will receive one (1) new ADS in exchange for every five existing ADSs surrendered. Holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System (“DRS”) and in The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will have their ADSs automatically exchanged and need not take any action. The exchange of every five existing ADSs then-held for one (1) new ADS will occur automatically, at the Effective Date, with the then-held ADSs being cancelled and new ADSs being issued by the depositary bank. DBV’s ADSs will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “DBVT”.\n\nNo fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the change in the ADS Ratio. Instead, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees, taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank. The ADS Ratio Change will have no impact on DBV’s underlying ordinary shares, and no ordinary shares will be issued or cancelled in connection with the ADS Ratio Change.\n\nAs a result of the change in the ADS Ratio, DBV’s ADS trading price is expected to increase proportionally, although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price after the ADS Ratio Change will be equal to or greater than five times the ADS trading price before the change.\n\n**About DBV Technologies** DBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary Viaskin® patch technology to address food allergies, which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies, including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™), the Viaskin® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).\n\nDBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon, France, with North American operations in Warren, NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV, ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing one ordinary share) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Select Market (Ticker: DBVT).\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.dbv-technologies.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=DWBvG7ATR-bKdxDVwNcTSvTUukTWprztLOOMnQbRUZeqjYcFGdLo4wzvHsSp4ZcjrgY6DtEjKK9Cw3aMiF8K02pTHqHPa7ey74wYN3_4kPsjU-Gn8_4hz_4UYJp3R9HnA5O1c93rynMLYfD_vmQpbFAQxlvsFNBQqrrmiuBlpe5O84dWBlOaRVvmQDAjbRtz6elJFYdVzrVx-5w8Dm4Aw19N33erERfOj9JtBeMgijbPPQbQIZXrw5KpCdx4KaJk2C0zqEq9JlaZv-Xf6ey_FtoKj7zetmyUiKZtsxJeT19zA3R6N9GLWChoAS2dOnJH-EdbhSu2nXO8l9Nev_AlJiUhzoVXvXlxOxL9XXvk-sJz0yFAON9csmoDcDvRkB58axySXOyahuf-ytw_gmTosA== \"www.dbv-technologies.com\") and engage with us on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WK3CRtpZEtrWoFzNTxdlub6BNsrEmogzQlBJkwYBSVtls1vAwzAb34H7M6YXCYYGMocJqRwTudTkkgIZsuOTamnxTcg9ZitoBCsNTykwupQ6k5ufX8mz7VAoTTuCJfXrG5sAS0jwvX89s56wifE0119ZszPMlvjuoEyf7h3kmfSMHs7yaFsgnbSlUJH93Ye6Xg0RnpMv8cHMO5CRSTrHLcPkYh3nfl3S1VxxS5OK6lPP0H7xUtFkkxIUv-JGSDHPQkE3UZMhuHbVSxa9jtKewBoJqtMaxlewLphpoGJXne2e0pv_V9F32pjO_hS_DuGJYvlv0bMU10N8Fuhqu8gNhk5wOXmTcfO3pMIPXQJxS2CFgEbN-3aUWdyi0mUE_GuxroeS-j8Vh_gunHAsA_P0RA== \"X \\(formerly Twitter\\)\") and [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9YkLYlJ06-IuFcTN1sujDj7v3YzQiuLACF3G84vVFlAfscNgzts7efJtgQdFKQxvFy2k41cr1PxwDk9RER7wJx8Dxh7rbs0zJ8jMxy4QHrr7ecMOIajVJWALjyakeGEhdZdbVYs6giJDjP2jb8BgTKhpf-UsOq-4A3dricmXjK6a3Vjooiinp5JzG8h2MAWQ_dNEM1slCmrVJb1J1P6W3VwMWknQgvS2oPGkOyjj8c8clWWRUSvKrqVYK93jTTpMySGydPdRcc600jfpNjfWpFuybQ0FepVR1gz1WY5rTNxscWTjchjR4IeHMlL8ytgQbfq4-wh0WgV_AknlaN0EQvjnLPp5FszTdMQSpCNhiU7N3EwwLWg8_Xu20j3d_meXFMB-RsUGVhqJ1s3qc5npNA== \"LinkedIn\"). \n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates, including the expected impact of the ADS Ratio Change on DBV’s trading price and ability to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement.

The quarterly and nine months financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on November 6, 2024.\n\n**Financial Highlights for the third quarter****En****ded September 30, 2024**\n\nThe Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents** Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $46.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $141.4 million as of December 31, 2023, a net decrease of $95.0 million. This decrease includes $92.2 million in operating activities, mainly in external clinical trial related expenses, notably progress on patient enrollment in VITESSE Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as Regulatory and Manufacturing activities to support ongoing clinical trials.\n\nThe Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of the date of the filling, DBV’s available cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to support our operating plan for at least the next 12 months. As such, there is substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBased on its current operations, plans and assumptions, the Company expects that its balance of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operations into Q1 2025.\n\nThe Company intends to seek additional capital as it continues research and development efforts and prepares for the launch of Viaskin Peanut, if approved. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain the necessary financing to meet its needs or to obtain funds at attractive terms and conditions, including as a result of disruptions or fluctuations of the global financial markets due to various factors outside the Company’s control. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to the Company, including reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. \n\nIf the Company is not successful in its financing objectives, the Company could have to scale back its operations, notably by delaying or reducing the scope of its research and development efforts or obtain financing through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to its product candidates that the Company might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently. \n\n_In millions of USD_ _(unaudited)_ |  U.S. GAAP   \n---|---  \nnine months ended September 30,   \n**2024** |  2023   \n**Net cash & cash equivalents at the beginning of the period** |  **141.4** |  **209.2**  \nNet cash flow used in operating activities  |  (92.2)  |  (66.0)   \nNet cash flow provided by / (used in) investing activities  |  (1.5)  |  (0.6)   \nNet cash flow provided by / (used in) financing activities  |  (0.1)  |  7.0   \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash & cash equivalents  |  (1.1)  |  (0.4)   \nNet cash & cash equivalents at the end of the period  |  **46.4** |  **149.1**  \n  \nThis interim condensed financial information does not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets, liabilities, and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern. \n\n**Operating Income** Until the end of 2023, our operating income was composed of both the French Research Tax Credit scheme (Crédit d’Impôt Recherche, or “CIR”) and the revenue recognized under the Collaboration Agreement with NESTEC. Following the termination of the Collaboration Agreement on October 30, 2023, our operating income is now exclusively generated by the French Research Tax Credit.\n\nOperating income amounted to $3.6 million for the 9 months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $6.9 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease by $3.2 million is composed of (1) $1.9 million following the termination of the Collaboration Agreement with NESTEC, and (2) a lower Research Tax Credit entitlement as a greater proportion of studies activities are carried out in North America by $1.3 million\n\n_In millions of USD_ _(unaudited)_ |  U.S. GAAP  |  U.S. GAAP   \n---|---|---  \nnine months ended September 30,  |  three months ended September 30,   \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  2023   \nResearch tax credits  |  3.6  |  5.0  |  1.1  |  1.2   \nOther operating income  |  —  |  1.9  |  —  |  1.1   \nOperating income  |  **3.6** |  **6.9** |  **1.1** |  **2.4**  \n  \n**Operating Expenses** Operating expenses amounted to $96.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $71.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase by $25.0 million. This increase is primarily driven by Research & Development for $23.0 million resulting from (1) patient enrollment in VITESSE Phase 3 clinical trial, (2) preparatory activities for the COMFORT studies in anticipation of initiation after FDA alignment, (3) Regulatory and Manufacturing activities to support ongoing clinical trials.\n\nGeneral and Administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to one-time costs associated with (1) office moves in France and the U.S., (2) financing activities and (3) trademark and patent activities. \n\n_In millions of USD_ _(unaudited)_ |  U.S. GAAP  |  U.S. GAAP   \n---|---|---  \nnine months ended September 30,  |  three months ended September 30,   \n**2024** |  2023  |  **2024** |  2023   \nResearch & Development  |  (70.4)  |  (47.4)  |  (23.7)  |  (13.8)   \nSales & Marketing  |  (2.3)  |  (1.6)  |  (0.5)  |  (0.7)   \nGeneral & Administrative  |  (23.7)  |  (22.3)  |  (7.2)  |  (6.2)   \nOperating expenses  |  (96.4)  |  (71.4)  |  (31.4)  |  (20.6)   \n  \n**Net Loss and Net Loss Per Share** The Company recorded a net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of $90.9 million, compared to a net loss of $61.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOn a per share basis, net loss (based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding over the period) was $(0.95) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nU.S. GAAP  |  U.S. GAAP   \n---|---  \nnine months ended September 30,  |  three months ended September 30,   \n**2024** |  2023  |  **2024** |  2023   \nNet income / (loss) (in millions of USD)  |  (90.9)  |  (61.5)  |  (30.4)  |  (16.7)   \nBasic / diluted net income / (loss) per share (USD/share)  |  (0.95)  |  (0.65)  |  **(0.32)** |  **(0.17)**  \n  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION****(unaudited)**\n\nIn millions of USD  |  U.S. GAAP   \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, 2024  |  December 31, 2023   \nAssets  |  93.1  |  183.0   \nof which cash & cash equivalents  |  46.4  |  141.4   \nLiabilities  |  39.0  |  42.8   \nShareholders’ equity  |  54.0  |  140.2   \n  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(unaudited)**\n\n_In millions of USD_ |  U.S. GAAP  |  U.S. GAAP   \n---|---|---  \n**nine months ended September 30,** |  three months ended September 30,   \n**2024** |  2023  |  **2024** |  2023   \nOperating income  |  **3.6** |  **6.9** |  **1.1** |  **2.4**  \nResearch & Development  |  (70.4)  |  (47.4)  |  (23.7)  |  (13.8)   \nSales & Marketing  |  (2.3)  |  (1.6)  |  (0.5)  |  (0.7)   \nGeneral & Administrative  |  (23.7)  |  (22.3)  |  (7.2)  |  (6.2)   \nOperating expenses  |  **(96.4)** |  **(71.4)** |  **(31.4)** |  **(20.6)**  \nFinancial income/(expenses)  |  1.9  |  3.0  |  (0.1)  |  1.5   \nIncome tax  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nNet loss  |  **(90.9)** |  **(61.5)** |  **(30.4)** |  **(16.7)**  \nBasic/diluted net loss per share attributable to shareholders  |  (0.95)  |  (0.65)  |  (0.32)  |  (0.17)   \n  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (unaudited)**\n\n_In millions of USD_ |  U.S. GAAP   \n---|---  \n**nine months ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  2023   \nNet cash flows provided / (used) in operating activities  |  (92.2)  |  (66.0)   \nNet cash flows provided / (used) in investing activities  |  (1.5)  |  (0.6)   \nNet cash flows provided / (used) in financing activities  |  (0.1)  |  7.0   \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash & cash equivalents (U.S. GAAP presentation)  |  (1.1)  |  (0.4)   \nNet increase / (decrease) in cash & cash equivalents  |  **(94.9)** |  **(60.1)**  \nNet cash & cash equivalents at the beginning of the period  |  141.4  |  209.2   \nNet cash & cash equivalents at the end of the period  |  **46.4** |  **149.1**  \n  \n**About DBV Technologies** DBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform, Viaskin, to address food allergies, which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies, including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™), the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).\n\nDBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon, France, with North American operations in Warren, NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV, ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing one ordinary share) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Select Market (Ticker: DBVT – CUSIP: 23306J200).\n\nFor more information, please visit [_www.dbv-technologies.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9VaMXxyvJsU-C2_hU_Pnm-T_RwNbv_s3_dCOIQEqnE-hN2AwoFqZUld2pIvA0fGLeatO_skfkra-Q8YbniRyBMlnLTbg-RJDyes_OoE-fx_7mPO8x0UXJSA9SXRA6TMH) and engage with us on [_X (formerly Twitter)_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ms3VHcPmPXxcmngKruvVH_7kKWrHcwlczD1IIg343PEe7S795CmG5cOPhkTwoGDg0CNBadY7FdAT6kvZfzV1kO44ym-rnTJx3o-YWx5fA_VT7CM2V1QCWD6XSMBJDX-I) and [_LinkedIn_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LBoZAb4Rp_J209KhlboVrw3RSOOJ-M_lGjRaG4PIwSg7KkI8pBQ09XPrCE9CA244XfQisc8M690a3_GZ4PM95plR3hQwSF16Q6d1pLTlD9kl_4j0qQXaZf7gooXWWAHS). \n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates, including statements regarding DBV’s financial condition, forecast of its cash runway, the therapeutic potential of Viaskin® Peanut patch and EPIT™, designs of DBV’s anticipated clinical trials, DBV’s planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies, the ability of any of DBV’s product candidates, if approved, to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.

DBV has agreed to guidance provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on a pathway under the Accelerated Approval Program for the Viaskin Peanut patch in toddlers ages 1 – 3 years-old and has also received scientific advice from the EMA on a 1 – 7 year-old indication in Europe.

Regarding criterion 3, FDA has provided guidance and suggestion regarding the intermediate clinical endpoint, which DBV has agreed to in informal discussions with the FDA. DBV intends to formalize the Accelerated Approval guidance provided by FDA via submission of a meeting request to confirm the general elements of the two study components: the COMFORT Toddlers safety study, to be completed before BLA submission, and the confirmatory effectiveness study, including the third Accelerated Approval criterion regarding the intermediate clinical endpoint. DBV expects that the confirmatory study will be initiated by the time of BLA submission and would run in parallel to commercialization in the United States, if Viaskin Peanut is approved.\n\n**COMFORT Toddlers** DBV is pleased to have aligned with FDA on a wear time collection methodology in COMFORT Toddlers that provides a practical approach for subjects and families, is intended to generate sufficient data to support a BLA submission, and places wear time into an acceptable clinical hierarchy relative to other study endpoints. DBV has initiated study start-up activities and plans to screen the first subject in the second quarter of 2025. The company anticipates enrolling approximately 300 – 350 subjects on active treatment into the safety study, which would bring the total Viaskin Peanut patch safety database in toddlers to approximately 600 subjects, consistent with prior FDA guidance. \n\nWith this path forward, the BLA submission for Viaskin Peanut patch in 1 – 3 year-olds under the Accelerated Approval program is anticipated to be supported by:\n\n  1. Positive efficacy and safety data from DBV’s previously completed EPITOPE Phase 3 Study; and\n  2. Additional safety data generated in COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study to be initiated in 2Q 2025.\n\n\n\n_“DBV’s Viaskin Peanut patch has the potential to significantly improve the lives of peanut allergic toddlers and their caregivers,”_ stated **Dr. David Fleischer, FAAAAI, FACAAI, Professor of Pediatrics at Children’s Hospital Colorado**. _“With few approved treatment options for this patient population – the age range in which most young people are initially diagnosed with peanut allergy – the Viaskin Peanut patch has the potential to be a game changer in the food allergy community, and I look forward to having the opportunity to incorporate it into my own practice, if approved.”_\n\n**Post-Marketing Confirmatory Study** DBV and FDA are in general agreement that the confirmatory study will need to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Viaskin Peanut patch and will need to be initiated at the time that the BLA is submitted. DBV will prioritize initiation of the COMFORT Toddlers safety study to enable the BLA submission.\n\n“ _We are encouraged to learn that FDA has heard the voices of the food allergy community_ ,” said **Sung Poblete, PhD, RN, CEO of FARE (Food Allergy Research and Education)**. “ _This hopeful advancement in the treatment of peanut allergic toddlers has the potential to make a positive impact on the millions of families that are urgently awaiting innovative treatment options, and the confirmatory study will certainly add to the rich data that has been compiled in this important disease space. We stand by DBV in their efforts to advance Viaskin and look forward to representing the patient perspective.”_\n\n**Regulatory History of the Viaskin Peanut Patch in Toddlers 1 – 3** DBV and the FDA have been engaged in ongoing dialogue regarding the COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study in 1 – 3 year-olds with a peanut allergy. The focus of continued exchanges has been on patch adhesion, specifically:\n\n  * The hierarchy of an adhesion assessment within the COMFORT Toddlers study (FDA requesting that it be a study objective vs. exploratory assessment);\n  * The sufficiency of adhesion data collected during the EPITOPE study to fully characterize daily patch adhesion duration (wear time) given the EPITOPE adhesion data collection methodology, and, conversely, the collection methodology required to generate sufficient adhesion data to inform the Viaskin label in future studies; and\n  * The clinical relevance and regulatory use of adhesion data collected in a study that does not include an efficacy assessment. \n\n\n\nDBV’s proposed labeling solution, submitted to the FDA on June 28, 2024, became critical in exploring with the FDA, practical solutions to linking adhesion, efficacy and safety to best inform the label. These fruitful discussions have led to what DBV believes to be an actionable regulatory pathway. \n\n**Viaskin Peanut Patch in Children 4 – 7** In September 2024, DBV announced that patient screening had been completed for the Phase 3 efficacy trial of the Viaskin Peanut patch in peanut allergic children ages 4 – 7 years-old (VITESSE). A total of 654 subjects were enrolled, and DBV anticipates topline data in the fourth quarter of 2025. \n\nThe COMFORT Children safety study is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2025. This study plans to enroll approximately 250 subjects to raise the total number of 4 – 7 year-olds on active treatment across the development program to approximately 600, consistent with prior FDA guidance. These two studies will constitute the core studies for a BLA submission in 4 – 7 year-olds.\n\n**EMA Regulatory Update** DBV sought scientific advice from the EMA regarding the components of a MAA for the Viaskin Peanut patch. Previous advice obtained from two local country regulatory health authorities indicated a potential path for a 1 – 7 year-old registration with one patch, the modified patch. The EMA recently confirmed through scientific advice that the completed EPITOPE study in 1 – 3 year-olds, and a positive VITESSE study in 4 – 7 year-olds, could constitute an MAA submission for a 1 – 7 year-old indication for peanut allergy patients using the modified patch, along with a new safety study in 1 – 3 year-olds with the modified patch. Timing for the initiation of this new safety study to satisfy the important EU market is currently being planned. \n\nThe most recent European Academy of Allergy & Clinical Immunology (EAACI) draft Guidelines on the Management of IgE-mediated Food Allergy has the following recommendation: “In children and adolescents with IgE-mediated peanut allergy, peanut epicutaneous immunotherapy is suggested to achieve desensitization, if available.” This recommendation further supports the potential clinical benefit of the Viaskin Peanut Patch, if approved, in Europe and the unmet medical need.\n\n**Financial Update** Based upon preliminary estimates and information available to the Company as of the date of this announcement, DBV’s cash and cash equivalents amount to $46.4 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $66.2 million as of June 30, 2024, a net decrease by $19.8 million comprising :\n\n  * $22.5 million of net cash flow used in operating activities, mainly external clinical-related expenses notably progress on patient enrollment in VITESSE Phase 3 clinical trial, Regulatory and Medical activities as well as Manufacturing Operations.\n  * Partially offset by Research Tax Credit complementary refund for years 2020 to 2022 of $3.0 million.\n\n\n\nThese preliminary financial results reflect the Company’s estimates and are based on currently available information. The Company’s actual financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 have not yet been finalized by management or reviewed by the Company’s independent auditors. This preliminary financial information is not a comprehensive statement of all financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on these preliminary financial results.\n\nThe Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of the date of this announcement, the Company’s available cash and cash equivalents is not projected to be sufficient to support its operating plan for at least the next 12 months. As such, there is substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on current operations, plans and assumptions, the Company expects that its balance of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operations into 1Q 2025 and intends to seek additional capital as it continues research and development efforts and prepares for the launch of Viaskin Peanut, if approved. \n\n**Investor Conference Call and Webcast** DBV management will host an investor conference call and webcast today, October 22nd, at 5:00pm EST, to discuss these regulatory updates.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary Viaskin® patch technology to address food allergies, which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies, including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™), the Viaskin® patch is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).\n\nDBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon, France, with North American operations in Warren, NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV, ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing one ordinary share) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Select Market (Ticker: DBVT).\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.dbv-technologies.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=a8Fo17CMhtZJ7I5V1RiMqS4dJkeMDziTNiZxy9MHHYBNhkorZ9ZFl0Gt8sd6SNbrmJGd4X5ISNVWB9WuUnj_K7uwfVZFsjFBK8ePw5b8eR2ABnK5oYqBUFJ9iu3yx4KUbWzg_DZydQ3eiLRV4cXaKW4WBctHFgrktxoh-_Pc63a3kmjZFn6hzYtN3yvEou906CjMeCJ5Gji84-R8ujwOt9cnuQcYtOeQpFPLVqjFHG29b_72SFNc5fNRI2YCt26RdZm2pG8YWuj3dMk4c9yXidw7AlJPK0O1hU3GS09auZ6gWWddszCcpcoK7vkSwgTWeOVsehuKqzBGSDNNnQgIT88Sd8WRRTLWM_st63NPnv4Jo1yZHmJ_OeJyUlxruXB8Tv5Z1FNbT_ummN56GGMhBw== \"www.dbv-technologies.com\") and engage with us on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Oa7bkkcb8MaKodZy80nRV91YStjhZ9-utqpZRrAoLMraYhI0t-xaApxM6ifMD1_maDs8m9yFbZqeVRdDX1kX6b53RUOxc3ZCsnXVgdjRwG6FKvWfIJaHl28HifrMZuLxHErr8PkXwUsZDJdTgRKiceTLyVG0hMJQ56QQzr-Tnez34UkCNH2TdyTCcB9hbDgcdsh6Wo551qVq57KAqteddNJtw1QMPE6r6ZQQMc5aR-EZ9JC3VNgtRqrwnNo4CigfDZE0Ky-HXd6Swham5rr4lC5FLJC23Ab3EaVYkPv9a5EU-TFD0VnUrFsyweEbz9mjezC4L-q-Lo9jgQWneObE0buBin0R9uIKueDQRvk9pH2r8YqfRvmzYQHhQ2iPO10sYSxb3lpFsOUqbIY13aYwgw== \"X \\(formerly Twitter\\)\") and [LinkedIn](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q3V4J9Lfv5qZfVDowic8MQ_DPpzKP5usXLGXrXktOyK6-yr8S-eb6JaznXRWtHmoc4h7XwozSYDKOVrfKEGSX5DEUFrDwWBiEV3j3f78CKqzvO2pDGMfG1fpxNUtaOQa7vTLbbaSkK1Kmbpyh9IYjjPkUs0mHgg3iFl8jfJnbhVzV7aqBw9vIzlnUN6mkXbUJTvmu3H7rwWNc8Qoz40Ndv_xQPZ-kau6lqsUonbeA7VJaFlLPc0MG9vi2PmpJpP-vSlkQsqr3vl-NGXhmdBu40GKYBSVJX5Tz0rEsANSPNF3Mv6f8Qzch3OWH_XfjCilSr_jEWIRrRJgkFNRX1qcL4UCzqPednZcxIv3SqBBdj_pJN0yxKBPHhLjuqtpN8SiztpfXi8qbQIV4bzBHTnvNA== \"LinkedIn\"). \n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates, including statements regarding DBV’s financial condition (including certain preliminary financial results), forecast of its cash runway, the therapeutic potential of Viaskin® Peanut patch and EPIT™, designs of DBV’s anticipated clinical trials, DBV’s planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies, plans to formalize the Accelerated Approval guidance provided by the FDA via submission of a meeting request, expectations regarding initiation of the confirmatory study, plans and expectations with respect to COMFORT Toddlers (including DBV’s plan to prioritize initiation of this study), anticipated support for the BLA submission, DBV’s expectations with respect to an actionable regulatory pathway, and the ability of any of DBV’s product candidates, if approved, to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.
