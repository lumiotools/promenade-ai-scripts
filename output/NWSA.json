We are pleased stockholders once again convincingly supported the company and the Board of Directors on all matters. \n\nAmidst a period of significant industry disruption, News Corp has thrived through a combination of smart organic reinvestment, strategic acquisitions and divestments and disciplined cost management programs. Under the leadership of the Board and executive team, the company has not only achieved record profitability—including a record Q1 in Fiscal 2025—but has also shifted to recurring and digital-first revenue streams, while continuing to create significant value for all stockholders. News Corp’s success has been enabled in part by the current capital structure, and the company is pleased with the results of the Annual Meeting. \n\nNews Corp’s stock price has risen 45% over the past year, and materially outperformed both the S&P 500 and its designated peer group in recent years, but the company is by no means complacent. The Board and management are dedicated to driving sustained results, continuing the company’s ongoing transformation and actively shaping the future of news and information in the AI era. \n\n**About News Corp**\n\nNews Corp (Nasdaq: NWS, NWSA; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) is a global, diversified media and information services company focused on creating and distributing authoritative and engaging content and other products and services.

Ms. Panuccio will continue in an advisory capacity for six months to help ensure a smooth transition and to support Ms. Chandrashekar. \n\nMs. Panuccio has been a key leader during a period of rapid expansion and transformation for News Corp since becoming Chief Financial Officer in March 2017. During her tenure, News Corp has achieved record results, and transitioned into a diversified digital- and subscription-first business. The company has generated very healthy free cash flows, successfully completed two debt offerings at attractive rates and boosted capital returns through its $1 billion repurchase program. Under Ms. Panuccio’s leadership, News Corp made several strategic investments within the company’s key growth pillars, including expansion of B2B at Dow Jones, while streamlining costs and adding high margin, content licensing revenues from tech platforms. During her time at News Corp, the company’s share price has risen over 140% since March 1, 2017, materially outpacing sector performance during that period. \n\n“Susan’s steadfast leadership, sharp instincts and strategic mindset have helped guide News Corp through a remarkable period of growth. We will miss Susan deeply, and I am personally grateful for her partnership over the years,” said News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson. “Susan’s work not just here in New York, but in leadership roles in Australia and the United Kingdom, has been transformational for News Corp, and her impact cannot be understated. Her thoughtfulness and care for the company have continued through the succession process, and I am pleased to have her continued support for the remainder of this fiscal year.” \n\n“After nearly eight years in this role and over two decades at News Corp, I am going to take some much-desired time off to spend with my family,” said Ms. Panuccio. “It has been a privilege to help Robert lead News Corp’s transformation into the global news and information powerhouse it is today, and I truly believe that the company has an incredibly bright future ahead. I have been so fortunate over the years to have had the support of both Rupert and Lachlan, together with our Board of Directors, and I would like to sincerely thank them all.” \n\nThe Board of Directors, in consultation with Ms. Panuccio, has executed a well planned succession process to identify and transition responsibility to her successor. Ms. Chandrashekar has nearly 30 years of experience in international finance and investor relations, and has held senior positions at blue chip consumer facing companies, including Procter & Gamble, Mondelēz and Diageo, where she was Chief Financial Officer from 2021 to September of 2024. During her tenure at Diageo, Ms. Chandrashekar led the company through a period of profitable and accelerated growth, with the company growing at a 10.5% CAGR. An innovative global executive, Ms. Chandrashekar spearheaded and launched a multi-faceted global digital transformation program for Diageo. Her passion for mission and culture enabled the development and elevation of talent across the company. \n\n“I am thrilled to welcome Lavanya to News Corp, and look forward to her joining our leadership team,” said News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson. “Lavanya’s mix of financial acumen, global experience and proven integrity were compelling characteristics of her professional personality. Lavanya has meaningful experience leading transformation initiatives, and her support will be welcome as News Corp continues its ambitious journey.” \n\n“I have tremendous respect for News Corp and its leadership team, and am honored to join them,” said Ms. Chandrashekar. “I am fortunate to be joining this company during an exciting period of growth and transformation, and look forward to taking on the challenge of helping to shepherd News Corp into the future.” \n\n**About News Corp **News Corp (Nasdaq: NWS, NWSA; ASX: NWS, NWSLV) is a global, diversified media and information services company focused on creating and distributing authoritative and engaging content and other products and services.

Revenue rose 3 percent year-over-year to $2.58 billion, while our net income jumped 148 percent to $144 million. Total Segment EBITDA surged 14 percent to $415 million, and our EPS were 21 cents compared to 5 cents in same quarter last year. That we have achieved these record first quarter results in macro-conditions which are far from auspicious is compelling evidence of the successful transformation of News Corp over the past decade._\n\n_Meanwhile, the just-completed election has highlighted the importance of trusted journalism in a media maelstrom in which some journalists mistake virtue signaling for virtue. Artificial intelligence recycles informational infelicities and it is critical that journalistic inputs have integrity, which is why our partnership with OpenAI is so crucial and why we intend to sue AI companies abusing and misusing our trusted journalism._\n\n_Dow Jones and the New York Post have started proceedings against the perplexing Perplexity, which is selling products based on our journalism, and we are diligently preparing for further action against other companies that have ingested our archives and are synthesizing our intellectual property.”_\n\n**FIRST QUARTER RESULTS**\n\nThe Company reported fiscal 2025 first quarter total revenues of $2.58 billion, a 3% increase compared to $2.50 billion in the prior year period, primarily driven by higher Australian residential revenues at REA Group, higher digital book sales combined with improved returns at the Book Publishing segment and continued growth in the professional information business at the Dow Jones segment, in addition to a $35 million, or 1%, positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The increase was partly offset by lower revenues at the News Media segment. Adjusted Revenues (which excludes the foreign currency impact, acquisitions and divestitures as defined in Note 2) increased 2% compared to the prior year. \n\nNet income for the quarter was $144 million, a 148% increase compared to $58 million in the prior year, primarily driven by higher Other, net, higher Total Segment EBITDA and lower impairment and restructuring charges. These impacts were partially offset by higher income tax expense and higher depreciation and amortization. \n\nThe Company reported first quarter Total Segment EBITDA of $415 million, a 14% increase compared to $364 million in the prior year primarily due to strong contributions from REA Group within the Digital Real Estate Services segment, despite $12 million of deal costs related to the withdrawn offer to acquire Rightmove, as well as the Book Publishing segment. The increase was partly offset by higher costs at the Subscription Video Services segment primarily driven by the Hubbl product. Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 2) increased 12%. \n\nNet income per share attributable to News Corporation stockholders was $0.21 as compared to $0.05 in the prior year. \n\nAdjusted EPS (as defined in Note 3) were $0.21 compared to $0.16 in the prior year. \n\n**SEGMENT REVIEW**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30,   \n---  \n2024  |  2023  |  % Change   \n(in millions)  |  Better/  (Worse)   \n**Revenues:**  \nDow Jones |  $  |  552  |  $  |  537  |  3  |  %   \nDigital Real Estate Services |  457  |  403  |  13  |  %   \nBook Publishing |  546  |  525  |  4  |  %   \nSubscription Video Services  |  501  |  486  |  3  |  %   \nNews Media  |  521  |  548  |  (5  |  )%   \nOther  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  %   \n**Total Revenues** |  $  |  2,577  |  $  |  2,499  |  3  |  %   \n**Segment EBITDA:**  \nDow Jones |  $  |  131  |  $  |  124  |  6  |  %   \nDigital Real Estate Services |  140  |  122  |  15  |  %   \nBook Publishing |  81  |  65  |  25  |  %   \nSubscription Video Services  |  92  |  93  |  (1  |  )%   \nNews Media  |  16  |  14  |  14  |  %   \nOther  |  (45  |  )  |  (54  |  )  |  17  |  %   \n**Total Segment EBITDA** |  $  |  415  |  $  |  364  |  14  |  %   \n  \n**Dow Jones**\n\nRevenues in the quarter increased $15 million, or 3%, compared to the prior year, driven by continued growth in the professional information business, as well as higher content licensing revenue. Digital revenues at Dow Jones in the quarter represented 82% of total revenues compared to 81% in the prior year. Adjusted Revenues increased 2%. \n\nCirculation and subscription revenues increased $23 million, or 5%, primarily driven by an 8% increase in professional information business revenues, led by 16% growth in Risk & Compliance revenues to $81 million and 11% growth in Dow Jones Energy revenues to $68 million. Circulation revenues increased 1% compared to the prior year, as the continued growth in digital-only subscriptions was mostly offset by lower print volume. Digital circulation revenues accounted for 72% of circulation revenues for the quarter, compared to 70% in the prior year. \n\nDuring the first quarter, total average subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products were over 5.9 million, an 11% increase compared to the prior year. Digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’ consumer products grew 15% to over 5.3 million. Total subscriptions to _The Wall Street Journal_ grew 7% compared to the prior year, to nearly 4.3 million average subscriptions in the quarter. Digital-only subscriptions to _The Wall Street Journal_ grew 10% to over 3.8 million average subscriptions in the quarter, and represented 90% of total _Wall Street Journal_ subscriptions. \n\n**For the three months ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \n(in thousands, except %)  |  **Better/(Worse)**  \n_The Wall Street Journal_  \nDigital-only subscriptions  |  3,811  |  3,457  |  10  |  %   \nTotal subscriptions  |  4,255  |  3,991  |  7  |  %   \nBarron’s Group   \nDigital-only subscriptions  |  1,325  |  1,055  |  26  |  %   \nTotal subscriptions  |  1,446  |  1,197  |  21  |  %   \nTotal Consumer   \nDigital-only subscriptions  |  5,325  |  4,611  |  15  |  %   \nTotal subscriptions  |  5,908  |  5,308  |  11  |  %   \n  \nAdvertising revenues decreased $6 million, or 7%, primarily due to a 10% decline in print advertising revenues and a 5% decline in digital advertising revenues driven by lower advertising spend in the technology and finance sectors. Digital advertising accounted for 67% of total advertising revenues in the quarter, compared to 66% in the prior year. \n\nSegment EBITDA for the quarter increased $7 million, or 6%, primarily as a result of the higher revenues discussed above and lower newsprint, production and distribution costs, partially offset by higher marketing and employee costs. Adjusted Segment EBITDA increased 5%. \n\n**Digital Real Estate Services**\n\nRevenues in the quarter increased $54 million, or 13%, compared to the prior year, driven by strong performance at REA Group. Segment EBITDA in the quarter increased $18 million, or 15%, compared to the prior year, due to higher contribution from REA Group, despite $12 million of deal costs related to the withdrawn offer to acquire Rightmove, and included a $3 million, or 3%, positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The increase was partly offset by modestly lower contribution from Move. Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note 2) increased 11% and 13%, respectively. \n\nIn the quarter, revenues at REA Group increased $57 million, or 22%, to $318 million, primarily driven by higher Australian residential revenues due to price increases, increased depth penetration and an increase in national listings, a $7 million, or 3%, positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations and higher revenue from REA India. Australian national residential buy listing volumes in the quarter increased 7% compared to the prior year, with listings in Sydney and Melbourne up 11% and 9%, respectively. \n\nMove’s revenues in the quarter decreased $2 million, or 1%, to $140 million, primarily as a result of lower real estate revenues. Real estate revenues, which represented 77% of total Move revenues, decreased 4%, driven by the ongoing impact of the macroeconomic environment on the housing market, which led to lower lead and transaction volumes. Revenues from the referral model, which includes the ReadyConnect Concierge℠ product, and the core lead generation product decreased due to these factors. The decline was partially offset by strong growth in seller, new homes and rentals, including the partnership with Zillow, and increased advertising revenues. Based on Move’s internal data, average monthly unique users of [Realtor.com](http://Realtor.com)®’s web and mobile sites for the fiscal first quarter grew 2% compared to the prior year to 77 million. Lead volume was down 1% year over year as it continues to be impacted by high mortgage rates. \n\n**Book Publishing**\n\nRevenues in the quarter increased $21 million, or 4%, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher digital and backlist book sales and improved returns. Key titles in the quarter included _Hillbilly Elegy_ by J.D. Vance, _A Death in Cornwall_ by Daniel Silva and _The Au Pair Affair_ by Tessa Bailey. Bible sales were also strong. Adjusted Revenues increased 3%. \n\nDigital sales increased 15% compared to the prior year, driven by 26% growth from audiobook sales, which benefited from the continued contribution from the Spotify partnership and strong market conditions, in addition to higher e-book sales, which increased 7% compared to the prior year. Digital sales represented 25% of Consumer revenues for the quarter compared to 22% in the prior year. Backlist sales represented approximately 64% of Consumer revenues in the quarter compared to 61% in the prior year. \n\nSegment EBITDA for the quarter increased $16 million, or 25%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by higher employee costs. \n\n**Subscription Video Services**\n\nRevenues of $501 million in the quarter increased $15 million, or 3%, compared with the prior year, primarily driven by higher revenues from Kayo and _BINGE_ from increases in both volume and pricing, and an $11 million, or 2%, positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations, partly offset by the impact from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Adjusted Revenues of $490 million increased 1% compared to the prior year. Foxtel Group streaming subscription revenues represented 34% of total segment circulation and subscription revenues in the quarter, as compared to 30% in the prior year. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Foxtel’s total closing paid subscribers were over 4.6 million, a 1% increase compared to the prior year, driven by growth in Kayo and _BINGE_ subscribers, partly offset by fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Broadcast subscriber churn in the quarter was 11.0% compared to 11.4% in the prior year, while Broadcast ARPU for the quarter continued to increase, up 4% year-over-year to A$89 (US$60). \n\n**As of September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**(in 000's)**  \nBroadcast Subscribers   \nResidential  |  1,185  |  1,310   \nCommercial  |  237  |  233   \nStreaming Subscribers - Total (Paid)   \nKayo  |  1,511 (1,499)  |  1,411 (1,403)   \n_BINGE_ |  1,571 (1,552)  |  1,506 (1,449)   \nFoxtel Now  |  134 (131)  |  167 (161)   \nTotal Subscribers - Total (Paid)  |  4,658 (4,622)  |  4,646 (4,573)   \n  \nSegment EBITDA of $92 million in the quarter decreased $1 million, or 1%, compared with the prior year, primarily due to $11 million of Hubbl costs, higher sports programming costs related to contractual increases and higher production costs, partially offset by declines in other costs, including marketing and entertainment programming costs, and the higher revenues discussed above. Adjusted Segment EBITDA decreased 3%. \n\n**News Media**\n\nRevenues in the quarter decreased $27 million, or 5%, as compared to the prior year, including a positive $12 million, or 2%, impact from foreign currency fluctuations, primarily driven by lower other revenues from the transfer of third-party printing revenue contracts to News UK’s joint venture with DMG Media and lower advertising revenues. Adjusted Revenues for the segment decreased 7% compared to the prior year. \n\nCirculation and subscription revenues decreased $4 million, or 1%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower print volumes, partially offset by cover price increases and the $6 million, or 3%, positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. \n\nAdvertising revenues decreased $10 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower print advertising revenues at News Corp Australia and lower digital advertising revenues at News UK mainly driven by a decline in traffic at some mastheads due to algorithm changes at certain platforms, partially offset by a $5 million, or 2%, positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. \n\nIn the quarter, Segment EBITDA increased $2 million, or 14%, compared to the prior year, driven by cost savings at News UK as a result of the combination of its printing operations with those of DMG Media and other cost savings initiatives, including lower Talk costs, largely offset by the lower revenues discussed above. Adjusted Segment EBITDA increased 7%. \n\nDigital revenues represented 39% of News Media segment revenues in the quarter, compared to 37% in the prior year, and represented 37% of the combined revenues of the newspaper mastheads. Digital subscribers and users across key properties within the News Media segment are summarized below: \n\n  * Closing digital subscribers at News Corp Australia as of September 30, 2024 were 1,127,000 (979,000 for news mastheads), compared to 1,049,000 (937,000 for news mastheads) in the prior year (Source: Internal data) \n  * _The Times_ and _Sunday Times_ closing digital subscribers, including the _Times Literary Supplement_ , as of September 30, 2024 were 600,000, compared to 572,000 in the prior year (Source: Internal data). \n  * _The Sun_ ’s digital offering reached 80 million global monthly unique users in September 2024, compared to 134 million in the prior year (Source: Meta Pixel) \n  * _New York Post_ ’s digital network reached 103 million unique users in September 2024, compared to 127 million in the prior year (Source: Google Analytics) \n\n\n\n**CASH FLOW**\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flow: \n\nFor the three months ended September 30,   \n---  \n2024  |  2023   \n(in millions)   \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities  |  $  |  64  |  $  |  (55  |  )   \nLess: Capital expenditures  |  (95  |  )  |  (124  |  )   \nFree cash flow  |  $  |  (31  |  )  |  $  |  (179  |  )   \n  \nNet cash provided by operating activities of $64 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $119 million higher than net cash used in operating activities of $(55) million in the prior year, primarily due to lower working capital and higher Total Segment EBITDA, as noted above, partly offset by higher tax payments. \n\nFree cash flow in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $(31) million compared to $(179) million in the prior year. The improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities, as mentioned above, in addition to lower capital expenditures. \n\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow. \n\nFree cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP, which incorporates all cash movements during the period. The Company believes free cash flow provides useful information to management and investors about the Company’s liquidity and cash flow trends. \n\n**OTHER ITEMS**\n\n**Strategic Review**\n\nIn response to third party interest, the Company is continuing to assess strategic and financial options for the Foxtel Group, including its capital structure and assets. There is no assurance regarding the timing of any action or transaction, nor that the strategic review will result in a transaction or other strategic change. \n\n**COMPARISON OF NON-GAAP TO U.S. GAAP INFORMATION**\n\nAdjusted Revenues, Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA, Adjusted Segment EBITDA, adjusted net income attributable to News Corporation stockholders, Adjusted EPS, constant currency revenues and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures contained in this earnings release. The Company believes these measures are important tools for investors and analysts to use in assessing the Company’s underlying business performance and to provide for more meaningful comparisons of the Company’s operating performance between periods. These measures also allow investors and analysts to view the Company’s business from the same perspective as Company management. These non-GAAP measures may be different than similar measures used by other companies and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations for the differences between non-GAAP measures used in this earnings release and comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP are included in Notes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flow is included above. \n\n**Conference call**\n\nNews Corporation’s earnings conference call can be heard live at 5:00 p.m. EST on November 7, 2024.

Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the Company’s businesses. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company’s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). \n\nTotal Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operations and other factors that affect the Company’s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods. The following table reconciles net income to Total Segment EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: \n\nFor the three months ended September 30,   \n---  \n2024  |  2023  |  Change  |  % Change   \n(in millions)   \nNet income  |  $  |  144  |  $  |  58  |  $  |  86  |  148  |  %   \nAdd:   \nIncome tax expense  |  60  |  37  |  23  |  62  |  %   \nOther, net  |  (23  |  )  |  35  |  (58  |  )  |  **   \nInterest expense, net  |  18  |  23  |  (5  |  )  |  (22  |  )%   \nEquity losses of affiliates  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  50  |  %   \nImpairment and restructuring charges  |  24  |  38  |  (14  |  )  |  (37  |  )%   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  189  |  171  |  18  |  11  |  %   \nTotal Segment EBITDA  |  $  |  415  |  $  |  364  |  $  |  51  |  14  |  %   \n**Not meaningful   \n  \n**NOTE 2 – ADJUSTED REVENUES, ADJUSTED TOTAL SEGMENT EBITDA AND ADJUSTED SEGMENT EBITDA**\n\nThe Company uses revenues, Total Segment EBITDA and Segment EBITDA excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, fees and costs, net of indemnification, related to the claims and investigations arising out of certain conduct at _The News of the World_ (the “U.K. Newspaper Matters”), charges for other significant, non-ordinary course legal or regulatory matters (“litigation charges”) and foreign currency fluctuations (“Adjusted Revenues,” “Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA” and “Adjusted Segment EBITDA,” respectively) to evaluate the performance of the Company’s core business operations exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period such as the unpredictability and volatility of currency fluctuations. The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period. \n\nThe calculation of Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what type of events warrant adjustment. Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Total Segment EBITDA and Adjusted Segment EBITDA are not measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as substitutes for amounts determined under GAAP as measures of performance. However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company’s historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to investors to assist in their analysis of our performance relative to prior periods and our competitors. \n\nThe following table reconciles reported revenues and reported Total Segment EBITDA to Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Total Segment

However, management uses these measures in comparing the Company’s historical performance and believes that they provide meaningful and comparable information to investors to assist in their analysis of our performance relative to prior periods and our competitors. \n\nThe following tables reconcile reported revenues to constant currency revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024: \n\nQ1 Fiscal 2024  |  Q1 Fiscal 2025  |  FX impact  |  Q1 Fiscal 2025 constant currency  |  % Change - reported  |  % Change - constant currency   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n($ in millions)  |  Better/(Worse)   \nConsolidated results:   \nCirculation and subscription  |  $  |  1,129  |  $  |  1,157  |  $  |  18  |  $  |  1,139  |  2  |  %  |  1  |  %   \nAdvertising  |  391  |  381  |  6  |  375  |  (3  |  )%  |  (4  |  )%   \nConsumer  |  502  |  521  |  3  |  518  |  4  |  %  |  3  |  %   \nReal estate  |  311  |  357  |  6  |  351  |  15  |  %  |  13  |  %   \nOther  |  166  |  161  |  2  |  159  |  (3  |  )%  |  (4  |  )%   \nTotal revenues  |  $  |  2,499  |  $  |  2,577  |  $  |  35  |  $  |  2,542  |  3  |  %  |  2  |  %   \nDow Jones:   \nCirculation and subscription  |  $  |  436  |  $  |  459  |  $  |  2  |  $  |  457  |  5  |  %  |  5  |  %   \nAdvertising  |  91  |  85  |  —  |  85  |  (7  |  )%  |  (7  |  )%   \nOther  |  10  |  8  |  —  |  8  |  (20  |  )%  |  (20  |  )%   \nTotal Dow Jones segment revenues  |  $  |  537  |  $  |  552  |  $  |  2  |  $  |  550  |  3  |  %  |  2  |  %   \nDigital Real Estate Services:   \nCirculation and subscription  |  $  |  3  |  $  |  2  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  2  |  (33  |  )%  |  (33  |  )%   \nAdvertising  |  35  |  38  |  —  |  38  |  9  |  %  |  9  |  %   \nReal estate  |  311  |  357  |  6  |  351  |  15  |  %  |  13  |  %   \nOther  |  54  |  60  |  1  |  59  |  11  |  %  |  9  |  %   \nTotal Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues  |  $  |  403  |  $  |  457  |  $  |  7  |  $  |  450  |  13  |  %  |  12  |  %   \nREA Group revenues  |  $  |  261  |  $  |  318  |  $  |  7  |  $  |  311  |  22  |  %  |  19  |  %   \n  \nQ1 Fiscal 2024  |  Q1 Fiscal 2025  |  FX impact  |  Q1 Fiscal 2025 constant currency  |  % Change - reported  |  % Change - constant currency   \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n($ in millions)  |  Better/(Worse)   \nBook Publishing:   \nConsumer  |  $  |  502  |  $  |  521  |  $  |  3  |  $  |  518  |  4  |  %  |  3  |  %   \nOther  |  23  |  25  |  —  |  25  |  9  |  %  |  9  |  %   \nTotal Book Publishing segment revenues  |  $  |  525  |  $  |  546  |  $  |  3  |  $  |  543  |  4  |  %  |  3  |  %   \nSubscription Video Services:   \nCirculation and subscription  |  $  |  415  |  $  |  425  |  $  |  10  |  $  |  415  |  2  |  %  |  —  |  %   \nAdvertising  |  62  |  65  |  1  |  64  |  5  |  %  |  3  |  %   \nOther  |  9  |  11  |  —  |  11  |  22  |  %  |  22  |  %   \nTotal Subscription Video Services segment revenues  |  $  |  486  |  $  |  501  |  $  |  11  |  $  |  490  |  3  |  %  |  1  |  %   \nNews Media:   \nCirculation and subscription  |  $  |  275  |  $  |  271  |  $  |  6  |  $  |  265  |  (1  |  )%  |  (4  |  )%   \nAdvertising  |  203  |  193  |  5  |  188  |  (5  |  )%  |  (7  |  )%   \nOther  |  70  |  57  |  1  |  56  |  (19  |  )%  |  (20  |  )%   \nTotal News Media segment revenues  |  $  |  548  |  $  |  521  |  $  |  12  |  $  |  509  |  (5  |  )%  |  (7  |  )%   \nNews UK  \nCirculation and subscription  |  $  |  144  |  $  |  146  |  $  |  4  |  $  |  142  |  1  |  %  |  (1  |  )%   \nAdvertising  |  59  |  50  |  2  |  48  |  (15  |  )%  |  (19  |  )%   \nOther  |  25  |  11  |  —  |  11  |  (56  |  )%  |  (56  |  )%   \nTotal News UK revenues  |  $  |  228  |  $  |  207  |  $  |  6  |  $  |  201  |  (9  |  )%  |  (12  |  )%   \nNews Corp Australia   \nCirculation and subscription  |  $  |  107  |  $  |  103  |  $  |  2  |  $  |  101  |  (4  |  )%  |  (6  |  )%   \nAdvertising  |  93  |  90  |  2  |  88  |  (3  |  )%  |  (5  |  )%   \nOther  |  38  |  41  |  1  |  40  |  8  |  %  |  5  |  %   \nTotal News Corp Australia revenues  |  $  |  238  |  $  |  234  |  $  |  5  |  $  |  229  |  (2  |  )%  |  (4  |  )%   \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241107961040r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241107961040/en/>\n\nInvestor Relations Michael Florin 212-416-3363 mflorin@newscorp.com\n\nAnthony Rudolf 212-416-3040 arudolf@newscorp.com\n\nCorporate Communications Arthur Bochner 646-422-9671 abochner@newscorp.com\n\nSource: News Corporation\n"
