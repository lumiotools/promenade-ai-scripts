          "content": "Hawkins, Inc. Reports\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results\nRoseville, Minn., October 30, 2024 – Hawkins, Inc. (Nasdaq: HWKN) today announced results for the six months ended\nSeptember 29, 2024, its second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Highlights:\n• Record second quarter results for revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share\n(“EPS”) and adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”), a non-\nGAAP measure.\n• Overall revenue growth of 4%, once again driven by the Water Treatment segment growth of 23% over the same\nperiod of the prior year.\n• Gross profit increase of 12% over the same period of the prior year, with Water Treatment segment gross profit\ngrowth of 22%.\n• Second quarter operating income of $33.7 million, our 26th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating income\nincrease.\n• Diluted EPS of $1.16, an increase of $0.06, or 5%, compared to the same period of the prior year.\n• Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $46.3 million, a 12% increase over the same period of the prior year.\nTrailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA exceeded $157 million.\nExecutive Commentary – Patrick H. Hawkins, Chief Executive Officer and President:\n“Our record performance in the second quarter was once again driven by our Water Treatment business, as we continued to\ngain efficiencies within our recent acquisitions and made progress towards future acquisition targets. Within the quarter we\nsaw strong revenue growth of 23% in our Water Treatment business driven by our recent acquisitions, with organic volume\nflat due to unfavorable weather conditions in several regions. Revenue in our Industrial segment declined year over year due\nprimarily to reduced selling prices driven by lower commodity costs, with volumes up slightly. Health and Nutrition revenues\ndeclined due to lower sales of our manufactured products and overall softness in the market. Overall, we saw 4% revenue\ngrowth with gross profit increasing 12%, overcoming the $3.2 million LIFO benefit we saw in the second quarter of fiscal\n2024.”\nMr. Hawkins, continued, “Our balance sheet continues to be strong, as we paid down $30 million of debt within the quarter,\nresulting in our leverage ratio being 0.65x trailing 12-month proforma adjusted EBITDA at the end of the quarter. Looking to\nthe third quarter, we expect continued growth within our Water Treatment segment and for our Health and Nutrition\nsegment to resume growth. We expect to see our Industrial segment continue to perform similar to the first half of fiscal\n2025.”\nSecond Quarter Financial Highlights:\nNET INCOME\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company reported net income of $24.1 million, or $1.16 per diluted share,\ncompared to net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 of $23.2 million, or $1.10 per diluted share.\nREVENUE\nSales were $247.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of $10.5 million, or 4%, from sales of $236.5\nmillion in the same period a year ago. Increased sales in our Water Treatment segment more than offset sales softness in our\nIndustrial and Health and Nutrition segments. Water Treatment segment sales increased $23.6 million, or 23%, to $124.5\nmillion for the current quarter, from $100.9 million in the same period a year ago. Water Treatment sales increased as a result\nof added sales from our acquired businesses. Industrial segment sales decreased $8.6 million, or 9%, to $89.9 million for the\ncurrent quarter, from $98.5 million in the same period a year ago. Although overall volumes increased slightly year over year,\nsales decreased as a result of lower selling prices on certain products, driven by lower raw material costs and competitive\npricing actions. Health and Nutrition segment sales decreased $4.5 million, or 12%, to $32.6 million for the current quarter,\nfrom $37.1 million in the same period a year ago. Health and Nutrition sales decreased due to lower sales of our\nmanufactured products driven by reduced volumes and selling prices due to decreased demand for certain of our products.\nGROSS PROFIT\nGross profit increased $6.3 million, or 12%, to $60.2 million, or 24% of sales, for the current quarter, from $53.9 million, or\n23% of sales, in the same period a year ago. During the current quarter, the LIFO reserve was unchanged, having no impact on\ngross profit. In the same quarter a year ago, the LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profit increased, by $3.2 million. Gross\nprofit for the Water Treatment segment increased $6.3 million, or 22%, to $35.6 million, or 29% of sales, for the current\nquarter, from $29.3 million, or 29% of sales, in the same period a year ago. Water Treatment segment gross profit increased\nas a result of increased sales from our acquired businesses. Gross profit for the Industrial segment increased $0.5 million, or\n3%, to $18.3 million, or 20% of sales, for the current quarter, from $17.8 million, or 18% of sales, in the same period a year\nago. Industrial segment gross profit increased as a result of increased volumes of certain products and product mix changes.\nGross profit for our Health and Nutrition segment decreased $0.3 million, or 4%, to $6.4 million, or 20% of sales, for the\ncurrent quarter, from $6.7 million, or 18% of sales, in the same period a year ago. Health and Nutrition segment gross profit\ndecreased as a result of the decrease in sales.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.6 million, or 27%, to $26.5 million, or 11% of sales, for the current\nquarter, from $20.9 million, or 9% of sales, in the same period a year ago. Expenses increased primarily due to $3.8 million in\nadded costs from the acquired businesses in our Water Treatment segment, including amortization of intangibles of $1.5\nmillion. In addition, a year-over-year increase of $1.0 million in compensation expense related to our non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan increased SG&A expenses, with the offset in other income.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important performance indicator and a key compliance measure under\nthe terms of our credit agreement. An explanation of the computation of adjusted EBITDA is presented below. Adjusted\nEBITDA for the three months ended September 29, 2024 was $46.3 million, an increase of $4.8 million, or 12%, from $41.5\nmillion in the same period a year ago.\nINCOME TAXES\nOur effective income tax rate was 27% for both the current quarter and for the same period a year ago. The effective tax rate\nis impacted by projected levels of annual taxable income, permanent items, and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the full\nyear is currently expected to be approximately 26-27%.\nBALANCE SHEET\nAt the end of the second quarter, our working capital was $18 million higher than the end of fiscal 2024 due primarily to\nincreased inventory and lower liabilities due to the payment of certain year-end accruals in the first quarter. During the\nquarter, we paid down $30 million on our line of credit. Year-to-date net borrowings of $5.0 million and $59.2 million of\noperating cash flow was used to fund $25.4 million of acquisition spending for the acquisitions of Intercoastal Trading, Inc.\nand Wofford Water Service, Inc., capital spending of $21.3 million, stock repurchases of $9.1 million and dividend payments of\n$7.1 million. Our total debt outstanding at the end of the second quarter was $104.0 million and our leverage ratio was 0.65x\nour trailing 12-month proforma adjusted EBITDA, as compared to 0.66x of trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA at the end\nof fiscal 2024.\nAbout Hawkins, Inc.\nHawkins, Inc. was founded in 1938 and is a leading specialty chemical and ingredients company that formulates, distributes,\nblends, and manufactures products for its Industrial, Water Treatment, and Health & Nutrition customers.

To\nassist investors in understanding our financial performance between periods, we have provided certain financial measures not\ncomputed according to GAAP, including adjusted EBITDA. This non-GAAP financial measure is not meant to be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed\naccording to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies.\nManagement uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and to make\noperating decisions. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects\nof our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and\ntrends affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income adjusted for the impact of the following: net interest expense resulting from\nour net borrowing position; income tax expense; non-cash expenses including amortization of intangibles, depreciation and\ncharges for the employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants; and non-recurring items of income or expense, if\napplicable.\nTrailing 12-\nAdjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended Six months ended months ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1, September 29,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024\nNet Income (GAAP) $ 24,118 $ 23,216 $ 52,997 $ 46,646 $ 81,714\nInterest expense, net 1,427 717 2,690 1,865 5,107\nIncome tax expense 8,873 8,769 18,681 17,015 27,447\nAmortization of intangibles 3,196 1,724 5,998 3,394 11,143\nDepreciation expense 6,731 5,675 13,258 11,112 25,410\nNon-cash compensation expense 1,832 1,260 3,299 2,219 5,960\nNon-recurring acquisition\nexpenses 94 122 282 122 1,077\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 46,271 $ 41,483 $ 97,205 $ 82,373 $ 157,858\nHAWKINS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED)\n(In thousands, except share and per-share data)\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nSeptember October 01, September October 01,\n29, 2024 2023 29, 2024 2023\nSales $ 247,029 $ 236,526 $ 502,908 $ 487,646\nCost of sales (186,807) (182,640) (378,031) (381,769)\nGross profit 60,222 53,886 124,877 105,877\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (26,477) (20,895) (51,341) (40,399)\nOperating income 33,745 32,991 73,536 65,478\nInterest expense, net (1,427) (717) (2,690) (1,865)\nOther income (expense) 673 (289) 832 48\nIncome before income taxes 32,991 31,985 71,678 63,661\nIncome tax expense (8,873) (8,769) (18,681) (17,015)\nNet income $ 24,118 $ 23,216 $ 52,997 $ 46,646\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding - basic 20,757,397 20,903,690 20,786,938 20,905,707\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding - diluted 20,860,418 21,026,428 20,898,641 21,034,153\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.16 $ 1.11 $ 2.55 $ 2.23\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.16 $ 1.10 $ 2.54 $ 2.22\nCash dividends declared per common share $ 0.18 $ 0.16 $ 0.34 $ 0.31\nHAWKINS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)\n(In thousands, except share data)\nSeptember 29, March 31,\n2024 2024\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 7,526 $ 7,153\nTrade accounts receivables, net 115,221 114,477\nInventories 81,565 74,600\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 5,563 6,596\nTotal current assets 209,875 202,826\nPROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT: 402,104 386,648\nLess accumulated depreciation 184,642 177,774\nNet property, plant, and equipment 217,462 208,874\nOTHER ASSETS:\nRight-of-use assets 12,047 11,713\nGoodwill 111,566 103,399\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization 123,886 116,626\nDeferred compensation plan asset 11,698 9,584\nOther 3,163 4,912\nTotal other assets 262,360 246,234\nTotal assets $ 689,697 $ 657,934\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable — trade $ 50,956 $ 56,387\nAccrued payroll and employee benefits 12,701 19,532\nIncome tax payable 2,284 1,943\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 9,913 9,913\nEnvironmental remediation 7,700 7,700\nOther current liabilities 8,787 7,832\nTotal current liabilities 92,341 103,307\nLONG-TERM DEBT, LESS CURRENT PORTION 93,862 88,818\nLONG-TERM LEASE LIABILITY 9,687 9,530\nPENSION WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY 3,348 3,538\nDEFERRED INCOME TAXES 21,875 22,406\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITY 13,057 11,764\nEARNOUT LIABILITY 11,919 11,235\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 236 1,310\nTotal liabilities 246,325 251,908\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nCommon stock;

          "content": "Hawkins, Inc. Reports\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results\nRoseville, Minn., July 31, 2024 – Hawkins, Inc. (Nasdaq: HWKN) today announced results for the three months ended June 30,\n2024, its first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Highlights:\n• Record quarterly results for revenue, gross profit, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share (“EPS”)\nand adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP\nmeasure.\n• Revenue growth of 2% driven by Water Treatment segment growth of 25% over the same period of the prior year.\n• Gross profit increase of 24% over the same period of the prior year, with all three segments having double-digit\ngrowth.\n• Diluted EPS increase of $0.26, or 23%, to $1.38 per share.\n• Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $50.9 million, a 25% increase over the same period of the prior year.\nTrailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA exceeds $153 million.\n• As previously announced, closed on two acquisitions in the first quarter, further expanding our geographic reach\nwithin our Water Treatment segment.\n• For the fourth year in a row, Hawkins was certified as a Great Place to Work.\nExecutive Commentary – Patrick H. Hawkins, Chief Executive Officer and President:\n“We are extremely pleased with our strong first quarter results with Water Treatment becoming our largest reporting\nsegment, and our profitability continuing to grow by over 20% as we again experienced revenue and volume growth,\" said\nPatrick Hawkins, Chief Executive Officer and President. \"Our record revenue of $256 million was driven by our acquired\nbusinesses in our Water Treatment segment. Revenue was down in our Industrial segment due primarily to reduced selling\nprices driven by lower commodity costs, with volumes relatively flat year over year. Revenue in our Health and Nutrition\nsegment was also down slightly due to product mix changes. Gross profit increased double digits in all three of our segments\ndue to the product mix and our continued focus on pricing discipline. Our continuing strategy of investing in higher margin\nbusiness has helped drive the growth results we have experienced over the last five years. I am extremely proud of the entire\nHawkins team, and the commitment of each and every employee has contributed to the success of our company.”\nMr. Hawkins, continued, “We closed two acquisitions in our Water Treatment segment in the first quarter, and have now\ncompleted six acquisitions in the last 12 months, expanding our geographic reach in this segment. We are also happy that we\ncontinue to realize synergies with each deal. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and our leverage ratio at the end of\nthe first quarter was 0.84x. Looking to the future, we expect all three segments to continue to grow profitability and we will\ncontinue to deliver on our strategy of investing in our higher margin businesses, while servicing the needs of our customers to\nthe highest level possible.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights:\nNET INCOME\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company reported net income of $28.9 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared\nto net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 of $23.4 million, or $1.12 per diluted share.\nREVENUE\nSales were $255.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of $4.8 million, or 2%, from sales of $251.1 million in\nthe same period a year ago. Increased sales in our Water Treatment segment more than offset decreased sales in our\nIndustrial and Health and Nutrition segments. Water Treatment segment sales increased $23.5 million, or 25%, to $117.2\nmillion for the current quarter, from $93.7 million in the same period a year ago. Water Treatment sales increased as a result\nof added sales from our acquired businesses. Industrial segment sales decreased $17.7 million, or 15%, to $103.2 million for\nthe current quarter, from $120.9 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower\nselling prices on certain products driven by lower raw material costs and volume pressure. Health and Nutrition segment sales\ndecreased $1.1 million, or 3.0%, to $35.5 million for the current quarter, from $36.6 million in the same period a year ago.\nHealth and Nutrition sales decreased as a result of lower sales of our manufactured products, largely offset by increased sales\nof our specialty distributed products.\nGROSS PROFIT\nGross profit increased $12.7 million, or 24%, to $64.7 million, or 25% of sales, for the current quarter, from $52.0 million, or\n21% of sales, in the same period a year ago. During the current quarter, the LIFO reserve increased, and gross profit\ndecreased, by $0.4 million due primarily to an increase in our forecasted year-end quantities. In the same quarter a year ago,\nthe LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profit increased, by $0.2 million. Gross profit for the Water Treatment segment\nincreased $8.6 million, or 33%, to $35.0 million, or 30% of sales, for the current quarter, from $26.4 million, or 28% of sales, in\nthe same period a year ago. Water Treatment segment gross profit increased primarily as a result of increased sales from our\nacquired businesses. Gross profit for the Industrial segment increased $2.6 million, or 13%, to $21.9 million, or 21% of sales,\nfor the current quarter, from $19.3 million, or 16% of sales, in the same period a year ago. Industrial segment gross profit\nincreased as a result of improved unit margins on certain products. Gross profit for our Health and Nutrition segment\nincreased $1.5 million, or 24%, to $7.8 million, or 22% of sales, for the current quarter, from $6.3 million, or 17% of sales, in\nthe same period a year ago. Health and Nutrition segment gross profit increased as a result of improved margins on certain\nproducts.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $5.4 million, or 28%, to $24.9 million, or 10% of sales, for the current\nquarter, from $19.5 million, or 8% of sales, in the same period a year ago. Expenses increased primarily due to added costs\nfrom the acquired businesses in our Water Treatment segment and increased variable pay.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is an important performance indicator and a key compliance measure under\nthe terms of our credit agreement. An explanation of the computation of adjusted EBITDA is presented below. Adjusted\nEBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $50.9 million, an increase of $10.0 million, or 25%, from $40.9 million\nin the same period a year ago.\nINCOME TAXES\nOur effective income tax rate was 25% for the current quarter and 26% for the same period a year ago. The effective tax rate\nin the first quarter of both years was impacted by favorable tax provision adjustments recorded. The effective tax rate is\nimpacted by projected levels of annual taxable income, permanent items, and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the full\nyear is currently expected to be approximately 26-27%.\nBALANCE SHEET\nDuring the first quarter, our working capital was $24 million higher than the end of fiscal 2024 due primarily to increased\ncustomer receivable balances, increased inventory and lower liabilities due to the payment of certain year-end accruals in the\nfirst quarter. During the quarter, net borrowings of $35.0 million and $17.6 million of operating cash flow was used to fund\n$25.4 million of acquisition spending for the acquisitions of Intercoastal Trading, Inc. and Wofford Water Service, Inc., capital\nspending of $10.6 million, stock repurchases of $9.1 million and dividend payments of $3.4 million. Our total debt outstanding\nat the end of the first quarter was $134.0 million and our leverage ratio was 0.84x our trailing twelve-month proforma\nadjusted EBITDA, as compared to 0.66x of trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal 2024.\nAbout Hawkins, Inc.\nHawkins, Inc. was founded in 1938 and is a leading specialty chemical and ingredients company that formulates, distributes,\nblends, and manufactures products for its Industrial, Water Treatment, and Health & Nutrition customers.

To\nassist investors in understanding our financial performance between periods, we have provided certain financial measures not\ncomputed according to GAAP, including adjusted EBITDA. This non-GAAP financial measure is not meant to be considered in\nisolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures. The method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not computed\naccording to GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies.\nManagement uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and to make\noperating decisions. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects\nof our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and\ntrends affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income adjusted for the impact of the following: net interest expense resulting from\nour net borrowing position; income tax expense; non-cash expenses including amortization of intangibles, depreciation and\ncharges for the employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants; and non-recurring items of income or expense, if\napplicable.\nAdjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended\n(In thousands) June 30, 2024 July 2, 2023\nNet Income (GAAP) $ 28,879 $ 23,430\nInterest expense, net 1,263 1,148\nIncome tax expense 9,808 8,246\nAmortization of intangibles 2,802 1,670\nDepreciation expense 6,527 5,437\nNon-cash compensation expense 1,467 959\nNon-recurring acquisition expenses 188 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 50,934 $ 40,890\nHAWKINS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED)\n(In thousands, except share and per-share data)\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 July 02, 2023\nSales $ 255,879 $ 251,120\nCost of sales (191,224) (199,129)\nGross profit 64,655 51,991\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (24,864) (19,504)\nOperating income 39,791 32,487\nInterest expense, net (1,263) (1,148)\nOther income 159 337\nIncome before income taxes 38,687 31,676\nIncome tax expense (9,808) (8,246)\nNet income $ 28,879 $ 23,430\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding - basic 20,816,479 20,907,724\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding - diluted 20,914,085 21,012,788\nBasic earnings per share $ 1.39 $ 1.12\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.38 $ 1.12\nCash dividends declared per common share $ 0.16 $ 0.15\nHAWKINS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (UNAUDITED)\n(In thousands, except share data)\nJune 30, March 31,\n2024 2024\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 8,887 $ 7,153\nTrade accounts receivables, net 126,398 114,477\nInventories 81,199 74,600\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 5,503 6,596\nTotal current assets 221,987 202,826\nPROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT: 396,244 386,648\nLess accumulated depreciation 182,604 177,774\nNet property, plant, and equipment 213,640 208,874\nOTHER ASSETS:\nRight-of-use assets 12,157 11,713\nGoodwill 114,046 103,399\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization 124,563 116,626\nDeferred compensation plan asset 11,365 9,584\nOther 4,980 4,912\nTotal other assets 267,111 246,234\nTotal assets $ 702,738 $ 657,934\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable — trade $ 47,795 $ 56,387\nAccrued payroll and employee benefits 12,501 19,532\nIncome tax payable 11,751 1,943\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 9,913 9,913\nEnvironmental remediation 7,700 7,700\nOther current liabilities 8,332 7,832\nTotal current liabilities 97,992 103,307\nLONG-TERM DEBT, LESS CURRENT PORTION 123,840 88,818\nLONG-TERM LEASE LIABILITY 9,816 9,530\nPENSION WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY 3,443 3,538\nDEFERRED INCOME TAXES 22,367 22,406\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITY 12,244 11,764\nEARNOUT LIABILITY 11,577 11,235\nOTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 241 1,310\nTotal liabilities 281,520 251,908\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nCommon stock;
