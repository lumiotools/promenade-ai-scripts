We sold and transferred substantially all of the assets of Entertainment in December 2023.  \n  \n**Earnings Teleconference Information**\n\nCardlytics will discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results during a live audio webcast today, November 6, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET / 2:00 PM PT.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"hope,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"goals,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" or variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.\n\nOur actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: risks related to unfavorable conditions in the global economy and the industries that we serve; our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to vary from period to period; our ability to sustain our revenue growth and billings; risks related to our substantial dependence on our Cardlytics platform; risks related to our substantial dependence on JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“Chase”), Bank of America, National Association (\"Bank of America\"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) and a limited number of other financial institution (“FI”) partners; risks related to our ability to maintain relationships with Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America; the amount and timing of budgets by marketers, which are affected by budget cycles, economic conditions and other factors; our ability to generate sufficient revenue to offset contractual commitments to FI partners; our ability to attract new partners, including FI partners, and maintain relationships with bank processors and digital banking providers; our ability to maintain relationships with marketers; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including our ability to adapt to changes in consumer habits, negotiate fee arrangements with new and existing partners and retailers, and develop and launch new services and features; and other risks detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 6, 2024 and in subsequent periodic reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. \n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics**\n\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance in this press release: Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income per share and Free Cash Flow, as well as certain other performance metrics, such as monthly active users (“MAUs”) and average revenue per user (“ARPU”).\n\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\n\nWe have presented Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted Net (Loss) Income per share as non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers and marketers for services in order to generate revenue. Cardlytics platform Billings is recognized gross of both Consumer Incentives and Partner Share. Cardlytics platform GAAP Revenue is recognized net of Consumer Incentives and gross of Partner Share. Bridg platform Billings is the same as Bridg platform GAAP Revenue. Adjusted Contribution measures the degree by which revenue generated from our marketers exceeds the cost to obtain the purchase data and the digital advertising space from our partners. Adjusted Contribution demonstrates how incremental Revenue on our platforms generates incremental amounts to support our sales and marketing, research and development, general and administration and other investments. Adjusted Contribution is calculated by taking our total Revenue less our Partner Share and other third-party costs exclusive of deferred implementation costs, which is a non-cash cost. Adjusted Contribution does not take into account all costs associated with generating Revenue from advertising campaigns, including sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses, which we do not take into consideration when making decisions on how to manage our advertising campaigns. Management views Adjusted Contribution as the most relevant metric to measure the financial performance as it reflects the dollars we keep after all of our partners are paid. Adjusted EBITDA represents our Net Loss before interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; gain on debt extinguishment; acquisition, integration and divestiture costs (benefit); change in contingent consideration; and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; income tax benefit; and deferred implementation costs. Adjusted Net (Loss) Income as our Net Loss before stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; gain on debt extinguishment; acquisition, integration and divestiture costs (benefit); amortization of acquired intangibles; change in contingent consideration; and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted Net (Loss) Income per share as Adjusted Net (Loss) Income divided by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash used in operating activities, plus acquisition of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs and, in applicable periods, acquisition of patents. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for distribution or to sustain the business. We believe this supplemental information enhances stockholders' ability to evaluate our performance.\n\nWe believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\n\nWe define MAUs as targetable customers that have logged in and visited online or mobile applications containing offers, opened an email containing an offer, or redeemed an offer from the Cardlytics platform during a monthly period. We then calculate a monthly average of these MAUs for the periods presented. We believe that MAUs is an indicator of the Cardlytics platform's ability to drive engagement and is reflective of the marketing base that we offer to marketers. We define ARPU as the total revenue generated in the applicable period calculated in accordance with GAAP, divided by the average number of MAUs in the applicable period.\n\n**CARDLYTICS,

The strong advertiser demand, the addition of new partners and the high consumer engagement witnessed this quarter illustrate the fundamental strengths of our business and the value our platform can deliver.”\n\n“While we observed strong growth in redemptions, our results were challenged by slower-than-anticipated billings growth coupled with higher consumer incentives,” said Alexis DeSieno, CFO of Cardlytics. “We remain confident that our improved balance sheet continues to support investment in the business.”\n\n**Second****Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue was $69.6 million, a decrease of (9)% year-over-year, or (7)% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Billings, a non-GAAP metric, was $110.4 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year, or 2% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Adjusted Contribution, a non-GAAP metric, was $36.4 million, a decrease of (3)% year-over-year, or an increase of 1% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Net Loss was $(4.3) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, based on 49.1 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares, compared to a Net Loss of $(23.5) million, or $(0.67) per diluted share, based on 34.9 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was a loss of $(2.3) million compared to a loss of $(4.1) million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted Net Loss was $(7.6) million, or $(0.15) per diluted share, based on 49.1 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares, compared to Adjusted Net Loss of $(8.4) million, or $(0.24) per diluted share, based on 34.9 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.4 million, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP metric, was $(0.4) million, a decrease of $3.4 million compared to $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Key Metrics**\n\n  * Cardlytics MAUs were 165.5 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year, compared to 160.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Cardlytics ARPU was $0.42 compared to $0.48 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nDefinitions of MAUs and ARPU are included below under the caption “Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics.\"\n\n**CARDLYTICS, INC.****SUMMARY OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP RESULTS (UNAUDITED)****(Dollars in thousands)**\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2023 Results Excluding Entertainment****(2)**| **Change %**| **Change % Excluding Entertainment****(2)**  \nBillings(1)| $| 110,389| $| 109,424| $| 107,736| 1| %| 2| %  \nConsumer Incentives| 40,753| 32,723| 32,723| 25| %| 25| %  \nRevenue| 69,636| 76,701| 75,013| (9| )%| (7| )%  \nPartner Share and other third-party costs| 33,258| 39,170| 39,144| (15| )%| (15| )%  \nAdjusted Contribution(1)| 36,378| 37,531| 35,869| (3| )%| 1| %  \nDelivery costs| 7,661| 7,015| 7,015| 9| %| 9| %  \nGross Profit| $| 28,717| $| 30,516| $| 28,854| (6| )%| —| %  \nNet Loss| $| (4,257| )| $| (23,508| )| $| (22,523| )| (82| )%| (81| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1)| $| (2,285| )| $| (4,073| )| $| (3,823| )| (44| )%| (40| )%  \nAdjusted Contribution  \n% of Billings| 33.0| %| 34.3| %| 33.3| %  \n% of Revenue| 52.2| %| 48.9| %| 47.8| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA  \n% of Billings| (2.1| )%| (3.7| )%| (3.5| )%  \n% of Revenue| (3.3| )%| (5.3| )%| (5.1| )%  \n  \n(1) Billings, Adjusted Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.\n\nOur actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: risks related to unfavorable conditions in the global economy and the industries that we serve; our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to vary from period to period; our ability to sustain our revenue growth and billings; risks related to our substantial dependence on our Cardlytics platform; risks related to our substantial dependence on JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“Chase”), Bank of America, National Association (\"Bank of America\"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) and a limited number of other financial institution (“FI”) partners; risks related to our ability to maintain relationships with Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America; the amount and timing of budgets by marketers, which are affected by budget cycles, economic conditions and other factors; our ability to generate sufficient revenue to offset contractual commitments to FI partners; our ability to attract new partners, including FI partners, and maintain relationships with bank processors and digital banking providers; our ability to maintain relationships with marketers; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including our ability to adapt to changes in consumer habits, negotiate fee arrangements with new and existing partners and retailers, and develop and launch new services and features; and other risks detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 7, 2024 and in subsequent periodic reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. \n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics**\n\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance in this press release: Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss per share and Free Cash Flow, as well as certain other performance metrics, such as monthly active users (“MAUs”) and average revenue per user (“ARPU”).\n\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\n\nWe have presented Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per share as non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers and marketers for services in order to generate revenue. Cardlytics platform Billings is recognized gross of both Consumer Incentives and Partner Share. Cardlytics platform GAAP Revenue is recognized net of Consumer Incentives and gross of Partner Share. Bridg platform Billings is the same as Bridg platform GAAP Revenue. Adjusted Contribution measures the degree by which revenue generated from our marketers exceeds the cost to obtain the purchase data and the digital advertising space from our partners. Adjusted Contribution demonstrates how incremental Revenue on our platforms generates incremental amounts to support our sales and marketing, research and development, general and administration and other investments. Adjusted Contribution is calculated by taking our total Revenue less our Partner Share and other third-party costs exclusive of deferred implementation costs, which is a non-cash cost. Adjusted Contribution does not take into account all costs associated with generating Revenue from advertising campaigns, including sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses, which we do not take into consideration when making decisions on how to manage our advertising campaigns. Management views Adjusted Contribution as the most relevant metric to measure the financial performance as it reflects the dollars we keep after all of our partners are paid. Adjusted EBITDA represents our Net Loss before interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; gain on debt extinguishment; acquisition, integration and divestiture benefit; and change in contingent consideration; and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; income tax benefit; and deferred implementation costs. Adjusted Net Loss as our Net Loss before stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; gain on debt extinguishment; acquisition, integration and divestiture benefit; amortization of acquired intangibles; and change in contingent consideration; and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted Net Loss per share as Adjusted Net Loss divided by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash used in operating activities, plus acquisition of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs and, in applicable periods, acquisition of patents. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for distribution or to sustain the business. We believe this supplemental information enhances stockholders' ability to evaluate our performance.\n\nWe believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\n\nWe define MAUs as targetable customers that have logged in and visited online or mobile applications containing offers, opened an email containing an offer, or redeemed an offer from the Cardlytics platform during a monthly period. We then calculate a monthly average of these MAUs for the periods presented. We believe that MAUs is an indicator of the Cardlytics platform's ability to drive engagement and is reflective of the marketing base that we offer to marketers. We define ARPU as the total revenue generated in the applicable period calculated in accordance with GAAP, divided by the average number of MAUs in the applicable period.\n\n**CARDLYTICS,

(NASDAQ: CDLX), a digital advertising platform, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"Our third quarter results beat the high end of our guidance, which reflects our relentless focus on addressing our short-term challenges,\" said Amit Gupta, CEO of Cardlytics. \"We maintain that our business transformation will take time, but we believe our priorities to build a more performant network and scale our partnerships will maximize consumer engagement and rewards.\"\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue was $67.1 million, a decrease of (15)% year-over-year, or (13)% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Billings, a non-GAAP metric, was $112.0 million, a decrease of (4)% year-over-year, or (2)% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Adjusted Contribution, a non-GAAP metric, was $36.4 million, a decrease of (15)% year-over-year, (11)% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Net Loss was $(145.2) million, or $(2.90) per diluted share, based on 50.0 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares, compared to a Net Loss of $(24.0) million, or $(0.63) per diluted share, based on 38.0 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was a loss of $(1.8) million compared to a gain of $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted Net Loss was $(7.5) million, or $(0.15) per diluted share, based on 50.0 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares, compared to Adjusted Net Income of $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, based on 38.0 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 million, an increase of $0.2 million compared to $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP metric, was $(3.9) million, a decrease of $1.9 million compared to $(2.0) million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Key Metrics**\n\n  * Cardlytics MAUs were 166.4 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year, compared to 162.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Cardlytics ARPU was $0.40 compared to $0.49 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nDefinitions of MAUs and ARPU are included below under the caption “Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics.\"\n\n**CARDLYTICS, INC.****SUMMARY OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP RESULTS (UNAUDITED)****(Dollars in thousands)**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2023 Results Excluding Entertainment****(2)**| **Change %**| **Change % Excluding Entertainment****(2)**  \nBillings(1)| $| 111,958| $| 116,430| $| 114,276| (4)%| (2)%  \nConsumer Incentives| 44,901| 37,425| 37,425| 20%| 20%  \nRevenue| 67,057| 79,005| 76,851| (15)%| (13)%  \nPartner Share and other third-party costs| 30,675| 36,144| 36,105| (15)%| (15)%  \nAdjusted Contribution(1)| 36,382| 42,861| 40,746| (15)%| (11)%  \nDelivery costs| 7,830| 7,012| 7,012| 12%| 12%  \nGross Profit| $| 28,552| $| 35,849| $| 33,734| (20)%| (15)%  \nNet Loss| $| (145,182| )| $| (23,966| )| $| (23,638| )| n/a| n/a  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1)| $| (1,816| )| $| 3,946| $| 3,593| n/a| n/a  \nAdjusted Contribution  \n% of Billings| 32.5| %| 36.8| %| 35.7| %  \n% of Revenue| 54.3| %| 54.3| %| 53.0| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA  \n% of Billings| (1.6)%| 3.4| %| 3.1| %  \n% of Revenue| (2.7)%| 5.0| %| 4.7| %  \n(1) Billings, Adjusted Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

We sold and transferred substantially all of the assets of Entertainment in December 2023.  \n  \n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Expectations**\n\nCardlytics anticipates Billings, Revenue, Adjusted Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA to be in the following ranges (in millions, except for percentage change rates):\n\n**Q4 2024 Guidance**| **YoY Change**| **YoY Change Excluding Entertainment****(3)**  \n---|---|---  \nBillings(1)| $102.0 - $108.0| (23%) - (18%)| (22%) - (18%)  \nRevenue| $62.0 - $67.0| (30%) - (25%)| (30%) - (24%)  \nAdjusted Contribution(2)| $33.0 - $36.0| (30%) - (24%)| (29%) - (22%)  \nAdjusted EBITDA(2)| ($5.0) - ($1.0)| ($15.0) - ($11.0)| ($15.3) - ($11.3)  \n(1) A reconciliation of Billings to GAAP Revenue on a forward-looking basis is presented below under the heading \"Reconciliation of Forecasted GAAP Revenue to Billings.\"  \n(2) A reconciliation of Adjusted Contribution to GAAP Gross Profit and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the items excluded from this non-GAAP measure.  \n(3) The column excludes results from the Entertainment business. We sold and transferred substantially all of the assets of Entertainment in December 2023.  \n  \n**Earnings Teleconference Information**\n\nCardlytics will discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results during a live audio webcast today, November 6, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET / 2:00 PM PT. Following the completion of the call, a recorded replay of the webcast will be available on Cardlytics’ website.\n\n**About Cardlytics**\n\nCardlytics (NASDAQ: CDLX) is a digital advertising platform.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"hope,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"goals,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" or variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.\n\nOur actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: risks related to unfavorable conditions in the global economy and the industries that we serve; our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to vary from period to period; our ability to sustain our revenue growth and billings; risks related to our substantial dependence on our Cardlytics platform; risks related to our substantial dependence on JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“Chase”), Bank of America, National Association (\"Bank of America\"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) and a limited number of other financial institution (“FI”) partners; risks related to our ability to maintain relationships with Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America; the amount and timing of budgets by marketers, which are affected by budget cycles, economic conditions and other factors; our ability to generate sufficient revenue to offset contractual commitments to FI partners; our ability to attract new partners, including FI partners, and maintain relationships with bank processors and digital banking providers; our ability to maintain relationships with marketers; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including our ability to adapt to changes in consumer habits, negotiate fee arrangements with new and existing partners and retailers, and develop and launch new services and features; and other risks detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 6, 2024 and in subsequent periodic reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. \n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics**\n\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance in this press release: Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income per share and Free Cash Flow, as well as certain other performance metrics, such as monthly active users (“MAUs”) and average revenue per user (“ARPU”).\n\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\n\nWe have presented Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted Net (Loss) Income per share as non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers and marketers for services in order to generate revenue. Cardlytics platform Billings is recognized gross of both Consumer Incentives and Partner Share. Cardlytics platform GAAP Revenue is recognized net of Consumer Incentives and gross of Partner Share. Bridg platform Billings is the same as Bridg platform GAAP Revenue. Adjusted Contribution measures the degree by which revenue generated from our marketers exceeds the cost to obtain the purchase data and the digital advertising space from our partners. Adjusted Contribution demonstrates how incremental Revenue on our platforms generates incremental amounts to support our sales and marketing, research and development, general and administration and other investments. Adjusted Contribution is calculated by taking our total Revenue less our Partner Share and other third-party costs exclusive of deferred implementation costs, which is a non-cash cost. Adjusted Contribution does not take into account all costs associated with generating Revenue from advertising campaigns, including sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses, which we do not take into consideration when making decisions on how to manage our advertising campaigns. Management views Adjusted Contribution as the most relevant metric to measure the financial performance as it reflects the dollars we keep after all of our partners are paid. Adjusted EBITDA represents our Net Loss before interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; gain on debt extinguishment; acquisition, integration and divestiture costs (benefit); change in contingent consideration; and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; income tax benefit; and deferred implementation costs. Adjusted Net (Loss) Income as our Net Loss before stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; gain on debt extinguishment; acquisition, integration and divestiture costs (benefit); amortization of acquired intangibles; change in contingent consideration; and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted Net (Loss) Income per share as Adjusted Net (Loss) Income divided by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash used in operating activities, plus acquisition of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs and, in applicable periods, acquisition of patents. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for distribution or to sustain the business. We believe this supplemental information enhances stockholders' ability to evaluate our performance.\n\nWe believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\n\nWe define MAUs as targetable customers that have logged in and visited online or mobile applications containing offers, opened an email containing an offer, or redeemed an offer from the Cardlytics platform during a monthly period. We then calculate a monthly average of these MAUs for the periods presented. We believe that MAUs is an indicator of the Cardlytics platform's ability to drive engagement and is reflective of the marketing base that we offer to marketers. We define ARPU as the total revenue generated in the applicable period calculated in accordance with GAAP, divided by the average number of MAUs in the applicable period.\n\n**CARDLYTICS,

(NASDAQ: CDLX), a digital advertising platform, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n“We continue to believe in the significant growth opportunity as we invest to modernize our platform. We are making progress, but transitions like this take time and these near-term challenges do not change the long-term potential of this business,” said Amit Gupta, incoming CEO of Cardlytics. \"We have the right team and right strategy in place to deliver stronger execution and shareholder value as we continue this transformation. The strong advertiser demand, the addition of new partners and the high consumer engagement witnessed this quarter illustrate the fundamental strengths of our business and the value our platform can deliver.”\n\n“While we observed strong growth in redemptions, our results were challenged by slower-than-anticipated billings growth coupled with higher consumer incentives,” said Alexis DeSieno, CFO of Cardlytics. “We remain confident that our improved balance sheet continues to support investment in the business.”\n\n**Second****Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue was $69.6 million, a decrease of (9)% year-over-year, or (7)% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Billings, a non-GAAP metric, was $110.4 million, an increase of 1% year-over-year, or 2% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Adjusted Contribution, a non-GAAP metric, was $36.4 million, a decrease of (3)% year-over-year, or an increase of 1% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Net Loss was $(4.3) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, based on 49.1 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares, compared to a Net Loss of $(23.5) million, or $(0.67) per diluted share, based on 34.9 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was a loss of $(2.3) million compared to a loss of $(4.1) million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted Net Loss was $(7.6) million, or $(0.15) per diluted share, based on 49.1 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares, compared to Adjusted Net Loss of $(8.4) million, or $(0.24) per diluted share, based on 34.9 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.4 million, a decrease of $1.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP metric, was $(0.4) million, a decrease of $3.4 million compared to $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Key Metrics**\n\n  * Cardlytics MAUs were 165.5 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year, compared to 160.0 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n  * Cardlytics ARPU was $0.42 compared to $0.48 in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nDefinitions of MAUs and ARPU are included below under the caption “Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics.\"\n\n**CARDLYTICS, INC.****SUMMARY OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP RESULTS (UNAUDITED)****(Dollars in thousands)**\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2023 Results Excluding Entertainment****(2)**| **Change %**| **Change % Excluding Entertainment****(2)**  \nBillings(1)| $| 110,389| $| 109,424| $| 107,736| 1| %| 2| %  \nConsumer Incentives| 40,753| 32,723| 32,723| 25| %| 25| %  \nRevenue| 69,636| 76,701| 75,013| (9| )%| (7| )%  \nPartner Share and other third-party costs| 33,258| 39,170| 39,144| (15| )%| (15| )%  \nAdjusted Contribution(1)| 36,378| 37,531| 35,869| (3| )%| 1| %  \nDelivery costs| 7,661| 7,015| 7,015| 9| %| 9| %  \nGross Profit| $| 28,717| $| 30,516| $| 28,854| (6| )%| —| %  \nNet Loss| $| (4,257| )| $| (23,508| )| $| (22,523| )| (82| )%| (81| )%  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1)| $| (2,285| )| $| (4,073| )| $| (3,823| )| (44| )%| (40| )%  \nAdjusted Contribution  \n% of Billings| 33.0| %| 34.3| %| 33.3| %  \n% of Revenue| 52.2| %| 48.9| %| 47.8| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA  \n% of Billings| (2.1| )%| (3.7| )%| (3.5| )%  \n% of Revenue| (3.3| )%| (5.3| )%| (5.1| )%  \n  \n(1) Billings, Adjusted Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

We sold and transferred substantially all of the assets of Entertainment in December 2023.\n\n**Earnings Teleconference Information**\n\nCardlytics will discuss its second quarter 2024 financial results during a live audio webcast today, August 7, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET / 2:00 PM PT.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.\n\nOur actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: risks related to unfavorable conditions in the global economy and the industries that we serve; our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to vary from period to period; our ability to sustain our revenue growth and billings; risks related to our substantial dependence on our Cardlytics platform; risks related to our substantial dependence on JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“Chase”), Bank of America, National Association (\"Bank of America\"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) and a limited number of other financial institution (“FI”) partners; risks related to our ability to maintain relationships with Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America; the amount and timing of budgets by marketers, which are affected by budget cycles, economic conditions and other factors; our ability to generate sufficient revenue to offset contractual commitments to FI partners; our ability to attract new partners, including FI partners, and maintain relationships with bank processors and digital banking providers; our ability to maintain relationships with marketers; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including our ability to adapt to changes in consumer habits, negotiate fee arrangements with new and existing partners and retailers, and develop and launch new services and features; and other risks detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 7, 2024 and in subsequent periodic reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. \n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics**\n\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance in this press release: Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss per share and Free Cash Flow, as well as certain other performance metrics, such as monthly active users (“MAUs”) and average revenue per user (“ARPU”).\n\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\n\nWe have presented Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per share as non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers and marketers for services in order to generate revenue. Cardlytics platform Billings is recognized gross of both Consumer Incentives and Partner Share. Cardlytics platform GAAP Revenue is recognized net of Consumer Incentives and gross of Partner Share. Bridg platform Billings is the same as Bridg platform GAAP Revenue. Adjusted Contribution measures the degree by which revenue generated from our marketers exceeds the cost to obtain the purchase data and the digital advertising space from our partners. Adjusted Contribution demonstrates how incremental Revenue on our platforms generates incremental amounts to support our sales and marketing, research and development, general and administration and other investments. Adjusted Contribution is calculated by taking our total Revenue less our Partner Share and other third-party costs exclusive of deferred implementation costs, which is a non-cash cost. Adjusted Contribution does not take into account all costs associated with generating Revenue from advertising campaigns, including sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses, which we do not take into consideration when making decisions on how to manage our advertising campaigns. Management views Adjusted Contribution as the most relevant metric to measure the financial performance as it reflects the dollars we keep after all of our partners are paid. Adjusted EBITDA represents our Net Loss before interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; gain on debt extinguishment; acquisition, integration and divestiture benefit; and change in contingent consideration; and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; income tax benefit; and deferred implementation costs. Adjusted Net Loss as our Net Loss before stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency (gain) loss; gain on debt extinguishment; acquisition, integration and divestiture benefit; amortization of acquired intangibles; and change in contingent consideration; and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted Net Loss per share as Adjusted Net Loss divided by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash used in operating activities, plus acquisition of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs and, in applicable periods, acquisition of patents. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for distribution or to sustain the business. We believe this supplemental information enhances stockholders' ability to evaluate our performance.\n\nWe believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\n\nWe define MAUs as targetable customers that have logged in and visited online or mobile applications containing offers, opened an email containing an offer, or redeemed an offer from the Cardlytics platform during a monthly period. We then calculate a monthly average of these MAUs for the periods presented. We believe that MAUs is an indicator of the Cardlytics platform's ability to drive engagement and is reflective of the marketing base that we offer to marketers. We define ARPU as the total revenue generated in the applicable period calculated in accordance with GAAP, divided by the average number of MAUs in the applicable period.\n\n**CARDLYTICS,

(NASDAQ: CDLX), a digital advertising platform, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n“Our results in the first quarter reflect the progress we have made at delivering more value to both consumers and our advertising partners,” said Karim Temsamani, CEO of Cardlytics. “We are driving deeper engagement in the form of higher redemptions, demonstrating that our investments are working, and signaling the potential for higher billings growth in the future.”\n\n\"Q1 was a good start to the year. We are seeing strong momentum in our international business and are making progress on our longer-term initiatives,” said Alexis DeSieno, CFO of Cardlytics. “Adjusted contribution, which reflects the money we keep after paying out rewards and partner share, grew 27% excluding Entertainment, and we delivered another quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to making material improvement to our balance sheet.”\n\n**First****Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue was $67.6 million, an increase of 5% year-over-year, or 8% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Billings, a non-GAAP metric, was $105.2 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year, or 12% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Adjusted Contribution, a non-GAAP metric, was $37.1 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year, or 27% excluding Entertainment.\n  * Net Loss was $(24.3) million, or $(0.56) per diluted share, based on 43.2 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares, compared to a Net Income of $13.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, based on 36.7 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was a gain of $0.2 million compared to a loss of $(6.1) million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted Net Loss was $(4.1) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, based on 43.2 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares, compared to Adjusted Net Loss of $(9.2) million, or $(0.25) per diluted share, based on 36.7 million fully diluted weighted-average common shares in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Net cash used in operating activities was $(17.6) million, a decrease of $7.6 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $(10.1) million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP metric, was $(22.4) million, a decrease of $9.5 million compared to $(12.9) million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Key Metrics**\n\n  * Cardlytics MAUs were 168.5 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year, compared to 158.1 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n  * Cardlytics ARPU was $0.40 compared to $0.41 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\nDefinitions of MAUs and ARPU are included below under the caption “Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics.\"\n\n**CARDLYTICS, INC.****SUMMARY OF GAAP AND NON-GAAP RESULTS (UNAUDITED)****(Dollars in thousands)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2023 Results Excluding Entertainment****(2)**| **Change %**| **Change % Excluding Entertainment****(****2****)**  \nBillings(1)| $| 105,216| $| 95,626| $| 93,876| 10.0| %| 12.1| %  \nConsumer Incentives| 37,608| 31,295| 31,295| 20.2| %| 20.2| %  \nRevenue| 67,608| 64,331| 62,581| 5.1| %| 8.0| %  \nPartner Share and other third-party costs| 30,543| 33,384| 33,358| (8.5| )%| (8.4| )%  \nAdjusted Contribution(1)| 37,065| 30,947| 29,223| 19.8| %| 26.8| %  \nDelivery costs| 6,173| 6,424| 6,424| (3.9| )%| (3.9| )%  \nGross Profit| $| 30,892| $| 24,523| $| 22,799| 26.0| %| 35.5| %  \nNet (Loss) Income| $| (24,275| )| $| 13,608| $| 14,751| n/a| n/a  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1)| $| 226| $| (6,091| )| $| (5,639| )| n/a| n/a  \nAdjusted Contribution  \n% of Billings| 35.2| %| 32.4| %| 31.1| %  \n% of Revenue| 54.8| %| 48.1| %| 46.7| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA  \n% of Billings| 0.2| %| (6.4| )%| (6.0| )%  \n% of Revenue| 0.3| %| (9.5| )%| (9.0| )%  \n(1) Billings, Adjusted Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures.

We sold and transferred substantially all of the assets of Entertainment in December 2023.  \n  \n**Earnings Teleconference Information**\n\nCardlytics will discuss its first quarter 2024 financial results during a live audio webcast today, May 8, 2024, at 5:00 PM ET / 2:00 PM PT.

These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"hope,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"goals,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"might,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" or variations of these terms or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control.\n\nOur actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: risks related to unfavorable conditions in the global economy and the industries that we serve; our quarterly operating results have fluctuated and may continue to vary from period to period; our ability to sustain our revenue growth and billings; risks related to our substantial dependence on our Cardlytics platform; risks related to our substantial dependence on JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“Chase”), Bank of America, National Association (\"Bank of America\"), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (“Wells Fargo”) and a limited number of other financial institution (“FI”) partners; risks related to our ability to maintain relationships with Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America; the amount and timing of budgets by marketers, which are affected by budget cycles, economic conditions and other factors; our ability to generate sufficient revenue to offset contractual commitments to FI partners; our ability to attract new partners, including FI partners, and maintain relationships with bank processors and digital banking providers; our ability to maintain relationships with marketers; our ability to adapt to changing market conditions, including our ability to adapt to changes in consumer habits, negotiate fee arrangements with new and existing partners and retailers, and develop and launch new services and features; and other risks detailed in the “Risk Factors” section of our Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8, 2024 and in subsequent periodic reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. \n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures and Other Performance Metrics**\n\nTo supplement the financial measures presented in our press release and related conference call or webcast in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we also present the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance in this press release: Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, Adjusted Net Loss per share and Free Cash Flow, as well as certain other performance metrics, such as monthly active users (“MAUs”) and average revenue per user (“ARPU”).\n\nA “non-GAAP financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of our historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements. We provide certain non-GAAP measures as additional information relating to our operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of liquidity. There are significant limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Further, these measures may differ from the non-GAAP information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies.\n\nWe have presented Billings, Adjusted Contribution, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per share as non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. Billings represents the gross amount billed to customers and marketers for services in order to generate revenue. Cardlytics platform Billings is recognized gross of both Consumer Incentives and Partner Share. Cardlytics platform GAAP Revenue is recognized net of Consumer Incentives and gross of Partner Share. Bridg platform Billings is the same as Bridg platform GAAP Revenue. Adjusted Contribution measures the degree by which revenue generated from our marketers exceeds the cost to obtain the purchase data and the digital advertising space from our partners. Adjusted Contribution demonstrates how incremental Revenue on our platforms generates incremental amounts to support our sales and marketing, research and development, general and administration and other investments. Adjusted Contribution is calculated by taking our total Revenue less our Partner Share and other third-party costs exclusive of deferred implementation costs, which is a non-cash cost. Adjusted Contribution does not take into account all costs associated with generating Revenue from advertising campaigns, including sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses, which we do not take into consideration when making decisions on how to manage our advertising campaigns. Adjusted EBITDA represents our Net (Loss) Income before interest expense, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency loss (gain); acquisition, integration and divestiture costs; and change in contingent consideration; and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; income tax benefit; and deferred implementation costs. Adjusted Net Loss represents our Net (Loss) Income before stock-based compensation expense; foreign currency loss (gain); acquisition, integration and divestiture costs; amortization of acquired intangibles; and change in contingent consideration; and, in applicable periods, certain other income and expense items, such as impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; loss on divestiture; restructuring and reduction of force; and income tax benefit. We define Adjusted Net Loss per share as Adjusted Net Loss divided by our weighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash used in operating activities, plus acquisition of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs and, in applicable periods, acquisition of patents. We believe free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for distribution or to sustain the business. We believe this supplemental information enhances stockholders' ability to evaluate our performance.\n\nWe believe the use of non-GAAP financial measures, as a supplement to GAAP measures, is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay, such as stock-based compensation expense. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures help indicate underlying trends in the business, are important in comparing current results with prior period results and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing operating performance.\n\nWe define MAUs as targetable customers that have logged in and visited online or mobile applications containing offers, opened an email containing an offer, or redeemed an offer from the Cardlytics platform during a monthly period. We then calculate a monthly average of these MAUs for the periods presented. We believe that MAUs is an indicator of the Cardlytics platform's ability to drive engagement and is reflective of the marketing base that we offer to marketers. We define ARPU as the total revenue generated in the applicable period calculated in accordance with GAAP, divided by the average number of MAUs in the applicable period.\n\n**CARDLYTICS,
