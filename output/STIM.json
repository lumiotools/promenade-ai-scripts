(NASDAQ: STIM), please note that in the second paragraph of the \"Stockholders Approve Acquisition of Greenbrook TMS\" section, it should say that the Company expects to achieve cash flow breakeven by the third quarter of 2025, not the second. The corrected release follows:\n\nNeuronetics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STIM) (the “Company” or “Neuronetics”) a commercial stage medical technology company with a strategic vision of transforming the lives of patients whenever and wherever they need help, with the best neurohealth therapies in the world, today announced its financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * _Third quarter 2024 revenue of $18.5 million, a 4% increase as compared to the third quarter 2023_\n  * _U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy system revenue of $4.1 million in the quarter, representing 48 systems_\n  * _U.S. treatment session revenue increased by 2% versus the third quarter of 2023_\n\n\n\n**Recent Operational and Marketing Highlights**\n\n  * _Neuronetics stockholders approved the acquisition of Greenbrook TMS on November 8, 2024_\n  * _NeuroStar Oral Presentation at AACAP 2024 Highlights Largest Study Evaluating TMS Efficacy in Adolescents with Depression_\n  * _Achieved milestone of over 188,000 global patients treated with 6.9 million treatment sessions_\n\n\n\n“We are very excited about the approval of the acquisition of Greenbrook TMS, which positions Neuronetics to be one of the largest, and most innovative provider of mental health care in the United States,” said Keith J. Sullivan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Neuronetics. “This strategic combination will significantly enhance our ability to expand access to mental health solutions through a unified commercial organization, while also creating opportunities to accelerate the rollout of additional services like SPRAVATO® across our network. By leveraging our complementary strengths - including Greenbrook’s extensive presence in the U.S. and Neuronetics’ industry-leading technology and training programs – we’re building an organization with the unique ability to increase patient access, improve outcomes, and ultimately, drive value for stockholders.”\n\nKeith J. Sullivan continued, “Beyond the Greenbrook acquisition, we saw continued progress across our strategic initiatives in the third quarter, highlighted by strong momentum in our adolescent treatment program and encouraging early results from our targeted marketing efforts. We're more confident than ever in our ability to create meaningful value for patients, providers, and stockholders while advancing mental health treatment.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n**Revenues by Geography**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**Amount** | **Amount** | **% Change**  \n**(Unaudited; in thousands, except percentages)**  \nU.S. | $ | 17,922 | $ | 17,211 | 4 | %  \nInternational | 608 | 673 | (10 | ) | %  \nTotal revenues | $ | 18,530 | $ | 17,884 | 4 | %  \n  \nTotal revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $18.5 million, an increase of 4% compared to the revenue of $17.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, total U.S. revenue increased by 4% and international revenue decreased marginally over the third quarter of 2023. The increase in U.S. revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in U.S. treatment sessions and U.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System sales period over period.\n\n**U.S. Revenues by Product Category**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**Amount** | **Amount** | **% Change**  \n**(Unaudited; in thousands, except percentages)**  \nNeuroStar Advanced Therapy System | $ | 4,108 | $ | 3,597 | 14 | %  \nTreatment sessions | 13,326 | $ | 13,060 | 2 | %  \nOther | 488 | $ | 554 | (12 | ) | %  \nTotal U.S. revenues | $ | 17,922 | $ | 17,211 | 4 | %  \n  \nU.S. NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.1 million, an increase of 14% compared to $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company shipped 49 and 43 systems, respectively.\n\nU.S. treatment session revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $13.3 million, an increase of 2% compared to $13.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, U.S. treatment session revenue per active site was $11,390 compared to $11,917 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 75.6%, an increase of approximately 980 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 gross margin of 65.8%. The increase in gross margin was a result of the change in product mix, the absence of one-time manufacturing cost by our new contract manufacturer and inventory impairment incurred in 2023.\n\nOperating expenses during the third quarter of 2024 were $21.7 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 5%, compared to $20.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(13.3) million, or $(0.44) per share, as compared to $(9.4) million, or $(0.33) per share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss per share was based on 30,267,236 and 28,875,720 weighted average common shares outstanding for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nEBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $(11.6) million as compared to the third quarter of 2023 EBITDA of $(7.7) million. See the accompanying financial table that reconciles EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to net loss.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $20.9 million as of September 30, 2024. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $59.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Stockholders Approve Acquisition of Greenbrook TMS**\n\nOn November 8, 2024, Neuronetics’ stockholders approved the previously announced acquisition of Greenbrook TMS Inc. (“Greenbrook”), in which Neuronetics will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Greenbrook in an all-stock transaction. The next step in finalizing the transaction is a hearing in respect of the Final Order pursuant to the Ontario Business Corporations Act scheduled for November 15, 2024. The transaction will create a vertically integrated organization capable of providing access to mental health treatment with significant scale in the U.S. The transaction offers multiple strategic benefits for Neuronetics and its customers, including increased brand awareness for NeuroStar, more consistent delivery of best practices, and the ability to offer a variety of positive benefits for all NeuroStar customers. Beyond the strategic benefits, the transaction is expected to create compelling financial benefits, including increased revenue scale and a strong growth trajectory, material cost synergies, an accelerated path to profitability, and a bolstered balance sheet.\n\nThe Company has outlined several key strategic initiatives, including merging Neuronetics’ sales team with Greenbrook's regional area managers to optimize commercial operations, implementing the Better Me Provider Program best practices across all Greenbrook sites, and accelerating the rollout of SPRAVATO® treatment across the combined network. Through these initiatives and additional identified opportunities to optimize the combined company's cost structure in connection with the transaction, the Company now expects to achieve cash flow breakeven by the third quarter of 2025.\n\n**NeuroStar TMS Data Presented at Leading Child & Adolescent Psychiatry Conference Shows Strong Efficacy in Treating Teen Depression**\n\nAt the 2024 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (“AACAP”) annual meeting, Neuronetics presented data from the largest study to date evaluating transcranial magnetic stimulation (“TMS”) in adolescents with major depressive disorder. In an oral presentation, Paul E. Croarkin, DO, MS of Mayo Clinic shared compelling results showing NeuroStar's strong efficacy in treating Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) in adolescent patients, with impressive response and remission rates of 78% and 48% respectively. The findings were similar to those previously reported in adult populations treated with NeuroStar TMS including clinically meaningful improvement in anxiety symptoms in this MDD population. As the only FDA-cleared TMS device for first-line adjunct treatment of MDD in patients aged 15-21, these findings further establish NeuroStar's leadership in providing innovative solutions for adolescent mental health treatment.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, on a stand alone basis, the Company expects total worldwide revenue between $19.0 million and $20.0 million.\n\nFor the full year 2024, on a stand alone basis the Company now expects total worldwide revenue to be between $71.0 million and $72.0 million.\n\nFor the full year 2024, on a stand alone basis, the Company now expects total operating expenses to be between $81.0 million and $82.0 million. This forecast excludes pre-closing transaction costs of approximately $2.0 million.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nNeuronetics’ management team will host a conference call on November 12, 2024, beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe conference call will be broadcast live in listen-only mode via webcast at [**https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/yk5bidgv**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CT9udcnJDEmQfCjvjqti6_isYtL_0w40AdjvENzgEt_DJgzXcm3P3YR4xgkMsUIyYxZolUE8ivZNsegyRiz-NQTsn2CQIyTYyIvVHDA08FtkJd0DvCkmuvl5hlH65YgIbbmCLBrtBHCmLPbfkAQQE3lGzgkSwiWcyJ-lDs_ewvg=)**.** To listen to the conference call on your telephone, you may register for the call [**here**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-561iGB67pqHGw-zd-DYrtRrUDZRbX5ND7Qwar3wlGrSfiyJLE48RsqeY9TFzKCsWHP-YI6dUIwyrokvQq_JcXlXIADxCa3uhloEF3XeUURKXJN0fE-5kpYfLjoLAqbTnrzrhM31L8_-TydYC1GizixFGDhcIR1Nf_YBtg3lCSQ=).

Further, management believes that the addition of the non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplementary information to, and facilitates analysis by, investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance, results of operations and trends. The Company’s calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly designated measures reported by other companies, because companies and investors may differ as to what type of events warrant adjustment.\n\nThe following table reconciles reported net loss to EBITDA:\n\n**Three Months ended** | **Nine months ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30 ,** | **September 30 ,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(in thousands)** | **(in thousands)**  \nNet loss | $ | (13,341 | ) | $ | (9,391 | ) | $ | (31,046 | ) | $ | (24,812 | )  \nInterest expense, net | 1,186 | 1,184 | 3,528 | 3,580  \nIncome taxes | — | — | — | —  \nDepreciation and amortization | 512 | 500 | 1,627 | 1,503  \nEBITDA | $ | (11,643 | ) | $ | (7,707 | ) | $ | (25,891 | ) | $ | (19,729 | )  \n  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI3MjY1NiM2NTc5Nzg5IzIxMTA0NDA=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZWZmNjhjZjYtMmJkOC00MzFkLTgyNmMtODA4MzFhMTJhYjMzLTExMjIwMTE=/tiny/Neuronetics.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/12db9039-d4bf-41a0-8b4a-324398e392b4/small/neuronetics-logo-rgb-purple-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/12db9039-d4bf-41a0-8b4a-324398e392b4)\n\nSource: Neuronetics\n"
