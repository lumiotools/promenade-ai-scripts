The complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offer were set forth in an Offer to Purchase dated November 20, 2024 (as supplemented, the “Offer to Purchase”), and the related Notice of Guaranteed Delivery.\n\nExpand Energy expects to accept for payment all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time and, in accordance with the terms of the Offer to Purchase, will pay all holders of such Notes $1,001.52 per $1,000 principal amount for all Notes accepted in the Tender Offer, including those properly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time and those tendered by the guaranteed delivery procedures described within the Offer to Purchase, within three business days after the Expiration Time, or December 3, 2024 (the “Settlement Date”). Also, on the Settlement Date, Expand Energy will pay accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date of the Notes to, but not including, the Settlement Date. For avoidance of doubt, interest on the Notes will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all Notes accepted in the Tender Offer, including any such Notes tendered through the guaranteed delivery procedures described within the Offer to Purchase. All Notes purchased on the Settlement Date will subsequently be retired and cancelled. Expand Energy will fund the payment for tendered and accepted Notes with the net proceeds from Expand Energy’s previously announced issuance and sale (the “Notes Offering”) of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.700% Senior Notes due 2035 (the “New Notes”) together with cash on hand.\n\nThe consummation of the Tender Offer is subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions described in the Offer to Purchase.\n\nJ.P.

The Notes Offering is expected to close on December 2, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Expand Energy intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering, together with cash on hand, to fund the purchase for cash of any and all of its outstanding 5.500% senior notes due 2026 that are tendered in connection with the tender offer launched on November 20, 2024 (the “Tender Offer”), the redemption of all of its outstanding 8.375% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “Redemption”), and the payment of related accrued and unpaid interest, premiums, fees and expenses. Any proceeds from the Notes Offering not used to fund the Tender Offer or the Redemption will be used for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe Notes Offering is not conditioned upon either the Tender Offer or the Redemption.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC, TD Securities (USA) LLC and BofA Securities, Inc. acted as joint book-running managers for the Notes Offering. The Notes Offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 20, 2024, and only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus.
