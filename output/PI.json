We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) as key measures to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operating plans. We use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as key measures when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. We believe these measures provide useful information for period-to-period comparisons of our business to allow investors and others to understand and evaluate our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly termed non-GAAP measures used by other companies. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding, if applicable for the periods presented, the effects of stock-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; restructuring costs; settlement income and related costs; induced conversion expense; other income, net; interest expense; acquisition related expense and related purchase accounting adjustments; and income tax benefit (expense). During the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude acquisition related expenses, related purchase accounting adjustments, and amortization of intangibles in connection with our Voyantic Oy acquisition. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we further revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude settlement income. We have excluded these items because we do not believe they reflect our core operations and us excluding them enables more consistent evaluation of our operating performance. The revision to our definition of adjusted EBITDA did not impact adjusted EBITDA for any previously reported periods because there was no impact of a similar nature in such prior periods affecting comparability. \n\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\n\nWe define non-GAAP net income as net income (loss), excluding, if applicable for the periods presented, the effects of stock-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; restructuring costs; settlement income and related costs; induced conversion expense; acquisition related expense and related purchase accounting adjustments; and the corresponding income tax impacts of adjustments to net income (loss). \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income to adjust for acquisition related expenses, related purchase accounting adjustments, and amortization of intangibles in connection with our Voyantic Oy acquisition. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we further revised our definition of non-GAAP net income to exclude settlement income. The revisions to our definition of non-GAAP net income did not impact non-GAAP net income for any previously reported periods because there was no impact of a similar nature in such prior periods affecting comparability. \n\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to adjust for income tax effects of adjustments to net income (loss), calculated at the statutory rate for current and historical periods. We have revised the prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation. \n\nFree cash flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less purchases of property and equipment. We define adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow less cash received from gain on litigation settlement. \n\n**IMPINJ, INC.** **RECONCILIATIONS OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES** **(in thousands, except percentages, unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nGAAP Gross margin  |  50.0  |  %  |  47.3  |  %  |  52.0  |  %  |  49.9  |  %   \nAdjustments:   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  1.9  |  %  |  2.2  |  %  |  1.8  |  %  |  1.5  |  %   \nPurchase accounting adjustments  |  0.0  |  %  |  0.2  |  %  |  0.0  |  %  |  0.2  |  %   \nStock-based compensation  |  0.5  |  %  |  0.8  |  %  |  0.5  |  %  |  0.6  |  %   \nNon-GAAP Gross margin  |  52.4  |  %  |  50.5  |  %  |  54.3  |  %  |  52.2  |  %   \nGAAP Net income (loss)  |  $  |  221  |  $  |  (15,762  |  )  |  $  |  43,528  |  $  |  (28,186  |  )   \nAdjustments:   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  3,247  |  3,668  |  10,155  |  9,734   \nStock-based compensation  |  14,841  |  12,307  |  41,336  |  35,679   \nRestructuring costs  |  —  |  —  |  1,812  |  —   \nAcquisition related expenses  |  —  |  4  |  986  |  1,676   \nPurchase accounting adjustments  |  —  |  112  |  —  |  388   \nOther income, net  |  (2,416  |  )  |  (1,090  |  )  |  (5,830  |  )  |  (3,620  |  )   \nIncome from settlement of litigation  |  —  |  —  |  (45,000  |  )  |  —   \nInterest expense  |  1,219  |  1,213  |  3,652  |  3,633   \nIncome tax expense (benefit)  |  207  |  (195  |  )  |  194  |  (472  |  )   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  17,319  |  $  |  257  |  $  |  50,833  |  $  |  18,832   \nGAAP Net income (loss)  |  $  |  221  |  $  |  (15,762  |  )  |  $  |  43,528  |  $  |  (28,186  |  )   \nAdjustments:   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  3,247  |  3,668  |  10,155  |  9,734   \nStock-based compensation  |  14,841  |  12,307  |  41,336  |  35,679   \nRestructuring costs  |  —  |  —  |  1,812  |  —   \nAcquisition transaction expenses  |  —  |  4  |  986  |  1,676   \nPurchase accounting adjustments  |  —  |  112  |  —  |  388   \nIncome from settlement of litigation  |  —  |  —  |  (45,000  |  )  |  —   \nIncome tax effects of adjustments (1) |  (1,410  |  )  |  (207  |  )  |  (4,434  |  )  |  (1,990  |  )   \nNon-GAAP Net income  |  $  |  16,899  |  $  |  122  |  $  |  48,383  |  $  |  17,301   \nNon-GAAP Net income per share — diluted  |  $  |  0.56  |  (2) |  $  |  0.00  |  $  |  1.63  |  (2) |  $  |  0.61   \nGAAP Weighted-average shares — diluted  |  29,727  |  26,920  |  31,918  |  (3) |  26,639   \nDilutive shares from stock plans  |  —  |  1,196  |  —  |  1,758   \nDilutive shares from convertible debt  |  2,589  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nNon-GAAP Weighted-average shares — diluted  |  32,316  |  (2) |  28,116  |  31,918  |  (2) |  28,397   \n(1) The tax effects of the adjustments are calculated using the statutory rate, taking into consideration the nature of the item and relevant taxing jurisdictions.   \n(2) Diluted net income per share includes the impact of our convertible debt using the if-converted method, which assumes full share settlement.

We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) as key measures to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operating plans. We use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as key measures when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. We believe these measures provide useful information for period-to-period comparisons of our business to allow investors and others to understand and evaluate our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly termed non-GAAP measures used by other companies. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding, if applicable for the periods presented, the effects of stock-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; restructuring costs; settlement income and related costs; induced conversion expense; other income, net; interest expense; acquisition related expense and related purchase accounting adjustments; and income tax benefit (expense). During the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude acquisition related expenses, related purchase accounting adjustments, and amortization of intangibles in connection with our Voyantic Oy acquisition. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we further revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude settlement income. We have excluded these items because we do not believe they reflect our core operations and us excluding them enables more consistent evaluation of our operating performance. The revision to our definition of adjusted EBITDA did not impact adjusted EBITDA for any previously reported periods because there was no impact of a similar nature in such prior periods affecting comparability. \n\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\n\nWe define non-GAAP net income as net income (loss), excluding, if applicable for the periods presented, the effects of stock-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; restructuring costs; settlement income and related costs; induced conversion expense; acquisition related expense and related purchase accounting adjustments; and the corresponding income tax impacts of adjustments to net income (loss). \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income to adjust for acquisition related expenses, related purchase accounting adjustments, and amortization of intangibles in connection with our Voyantic Oy acquisition. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we further revised our definition of non-GAAP net income to exclude settlement income. The revisions to our definition of non-GAAP net income did not impact non-GAAP net income for any previously reported periods because there was no impact of a similar nature in such prior periods affecting comparability. \n\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to adjust for income tax effects of adjustments to net income (loss), calculated at the statutory rate for current and historical periods. We have revised the prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation. \n\nFree cash flow\n\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less purchases of property and equipment.

          "content": "Impinj Third-Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nWednesday, October 23, 2024\n5:00 p.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. PT\nAndy Cobb, Impinj VP Strategic Finance\nThank you, Gary.\nGood afternoon and thank you all for joining us to discuss Impinj’s third-quarter 2024 results. On\ntoday’s call, Chris Diorio, Impinj’s co-founder and CEO, will provide a brief overview of our market\nopportunity and performance. Cary Baker, Impinj’s CFO, will follow with a detailed review of our\nthird-quarter financial results and fourth-quarter outlook. We will then open the call for questions.\nHussein Mecklai, Impinj’s COO, will join us for the Q&A. You can find management’s prepared\nremarks, plus trended financial data, on the company’s investor-relations website.\nWe will make statements in this call about financial performance and future expectations that are\nbased on our outlook as of today. Any such statements are forward-looking under the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Whereas we believe we have a reasonable basis for\nmaking these forward-looking statements, our actual results could differ materially because any such\nstatements are subject to risks and uncertainties. We describe these risks and uncertainties in the\nannual and quarterly reports we file with the SEC. We do not undertake, and expressly disclaim, any\nobligation to update or alter our forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nOn today’s call, all financial metrics except for revenue, or where we explicitly state otherwise, are\nnon-GAAP. All balance-sheet and cash-flow metrics except for free cash flow are GAAP. Please\nrefer to our earnings release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial metrics to the most\ncomparable GAAP metrics.\nBefore turning to our results and outlook, note that we will participate in the Baird 2024 Global\nIndustrial Conference on November 13th in Chicago and the UBS Global Technology Conference on\nDecember 4th in Scottsdale. We look forward to connecting with many of you there.\nI will now turn the call over to Chris.\n1\nChris Diorio, Impinj Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Andy. And thank you all for joining the call.\nOur third-quarter results were strong, with revenue and profitability well above our guidance.\nExcluding last quarter, with its $15 million licensing revenue, third-quarter revenue and adjusted\nEBITDA both set new records. Strength in supply chain and logistics, steady growth in retail general\nmerchandise and continued secular growth in both apparel and long-tail applications drove these\nstrong financial results. As Cary will highlight, these results again demonstrate the leverage in our\noperating model.\nStarting with silicon, third-quarter endpoint IC product revenue exceeded our expectations. Unit\nvolumes set a new quarterly record as parcel shippers and retailers prepared for the holiday season.\nAnd for the third consecutive quarter, M800 shipments more than doubled. Looking to the fourth\nquarter, we expect endpoint IC revenue to decline modestly versus third quarter, with typical\nseasonal trends partially offset by market strength. We also expect continued M800 adoption as\nmore M800-based inlays achieve market qualification.\nTurning to reader ICs, third-quarter volumes exceeded our expectations, driven by stronger-than-\nanticipated demand for both Indy and E-family ICs. Looking to fourth quarter, project timing at the\nlarge supply chain and logistics end user will push E-family revenue lower. Longer term, as we wind\ndown our legacy Indy ICs, we see continued E-family adoption across the broad RAIN market.\nOn solutions, we expect the current phase of the visionary European retailer’s ongoing rollout of our\nself-checkout and loss prevention solution to spike in the fourth quarter, driving strong fourth-quarter\ngateway revenue and growing endpoint IC volumes. At the large North American retailer, IC volumes\ncontinue ramping, driven by expanding general merchandise tagging. And we see the second large\nNorth American supply chain and logistics end user increasing label consumption this year and next.\nThese very public enterprise successes are driving additional Fortune 500 enterprises to us, both in\nexisting markets like retail general merchandise and new ones like perishable foods, and with them\nendpoint IC volumes. Our enterprise account pipeline is much larger today than our current base.\nExpect us to continue investing in enterprise solutions, including software and cloud services that we\nbelieve are key to our long-term success.\nTouching now on the broader market, our conviction in food tagging continues, buoyed by multiple\nsupply-chain and quick-serve restaurant rollouts as well as grocery pilots. While we are still in the\nearly days, the endpoint IC opportunity is at least an order of magnitude larger than any of today’s\nmarkets. In retail general merchandise, we continue seeing retailers piggyback on the pioneering\nrollout at the large North American retailer. And Qualcomm’s statement about RAIN reading in\nmobile devices galvanized expectations of RAIN as a digital product passport data carrier. It also\n2\npiqued retailer interest in engaging consumers through their connected items. At the recent RAIN\nAlliance meeting in Florence I highlighted one potential use case, which is consumers crowd-\nsourcing the location of items in our everyday world. Think Bluetooth trackers at no additional cost\nand with 10,000 times today’s footprint. With overall RAIN penetration still less than 1% of the total\nconnectible market, we remain laser focused on winning the race to connect every thing.\nIn closing, we delivered a very strong third quarter; our solutions focus continues paying dividends;\nand I am personally heartened by the consumer opportunity, which I’ve been touting for what feels\nlike ages, finally seeming within reach. Looking ahead, we see continued secular endpoint IC\ngrowth, category expansion and burgeoning solutions opportunities. As we continue driving our bold\nvision, I remain confident in our market position and energized by the opportunities ahead.\nBefore I turn the call over to Cary for our financial review and fourth-quarter outlook, I’d like to again\nthank every member of the Impinj team for your tireless effort. As always, I feel honored by my\nincredible good fortune to work with you. Cary.\nCary Baker, Impinj Chief Financial Officer\nThank you Chris, and good afternoon everyone.\nThird-quarter revenue was $95.2 million, down 7% sequentially from $102.5 million in second-\nquarter 2024 and up 46% year-over-year from $65.0 million in third-quarter 2023.\nThird-quarter endpoint IC revenue was $81.0 million, down 9% sequentially from $89.4 million in\nsecond-quarter 2024 and up 67% year-over-year from $48.6 million in third-quarter 2023. Excluding\nthe $15 million second-quarter licensing revenue, endpoint IC revenue grew 9% sequentially.\nLooking forward, we expect fourth-quarter endpoint IC revenue to decline, but on the favorable side\nof normal seasonality.\nThird-quarter systems revenue was $14.2 million, up 9% sequentially from $13.1 million in second-\nquarter 2024 and down 13% year-over-year from $16.4 million in third-quarter 2023. Systems\nrevenue exceeded our expectations, driven by strength in both test and measurement and reader IC\nsales. Looking forward, we expect fourth-quarter systems revenue to increase sequentially.\nThird-quarter gross margin was 52.4%, compared with 58.2% in second-quarter 2024 and 50.5% in\nthird-quarter 2023. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to less excess and obsolescence\ncharges in the current year. The sequential decrease was due primarily to second-quarter licensing\nrevenue. Excluding the licensing revenue, third-quarter product gross margin increased 140 basis\npoints sequentially, driven primarily by endpoint IC product mix, including fewer 200mm wafers.\nLooking forward, we expect fourth-quarter gross margin to increase sequentially.\n3\nTotal third-quarter operating expense was $32.5 million, compared with $32.8 million in second-\nquarter 2024 and $32.6 million in third-quarter 2023. Operating expense was below expectations,\ndriven by engineering program timing. Research and development expense was $17.9 million. Sales\nand marketing expense was $7.1 million. General and administrative expense was $7.6 million.\nLooking forward, we expect fourth-quarter operating expense to increase sequentially.\nThird-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $17.3 million, compared with $26.8 million in second-quarter\n2024 and $300 thousand in third-quarter 2023. Third-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.2%.\nThird-quarter GAAP net income was $200 thousand. Third-quarter non-GAAP net income was $16.9\nmillion, or 56¢ per share on a fully diluted basis.\nTurning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents and\ninvestments of $227.4 million, compared with $220.2 million in second-quarter 2024 and $113.2\nmillion in third-quarter 2023. Inventory totaled $88.4 million, up $7.6 million from the prior quarter.\nThird-quarter capital expenditures totaled $5.4 million. Free cash flow was $4.7 million.\nBefore turning to our guidance, I want to highlight three items specific to our results and outlook.\nFirst, we expect fourth-quarter gross margins to increase sequentially, driven by lower 200mm\nendpoint IC volume, a larger mix of systems revenue, and endpoint IC replenishments into Asia-\nbased authenticity pilots.\nSecond, as we signaled last quarter, we increased our second-half 2024 wafer purchases. We will\nmove some of those wafers to inventory, ahead of 2025 growth, and the remainder to fulfill stronger-\nthan-anticipated second-half 2024 demand.\nFinally, with the additional revenue and disciplined investment in third quarter, our adjusted EBITDA\nmargins are approaching the long-term range we presented at our 2023 Investor Day. As our\nrevenue scales, we anticipate incremental leverage and cash flow generation.\nTurning to our outlook, we expect fourth-quarter revenue between $91.0 and $94.0 million,\ncompared with $70.7 million in fourth-quarter 2023, a 31% increase at the midpoint. We expect\nadjusted EBITDA between $13.6 and $15.1 million. On the bottom line, we expect non-GAAP net\nincome between $13.4 and $14.9 million, reflecting non-GAAP fully diluted earnings-per-share\nbetween 45¢ and 49¢.\nIn closing, I want to thank the Impinj team, our customers, our suppliers and you, our investors, for\nyour ongoing support. I will now turn the call to the operator to open the question-and-answer\nsession. Gary.\n4"

We use adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss) as key measures to understand and evaluate our core operating\nperformance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operating plans. We use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as key measures when assessing our sources of liquidity,\ncapital resources, and quality of earnings. We believe these measures provide useful information for period-to-period comparisons of our business to allow investors and others to understand and evaluate our operating results in the\nsame manner as our management and board of directors. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP,\nand our non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly termed non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding, if applicable for the periods presented, the effects of stock-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; restructuring costs;\nsettlement income and related costs; induced conversion expense; other income, net; interest expense; acquisition related expense and related purchase accounting adjustments; and income tax benefit (expense). During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude acquisition related expenses, related purchase accounting adjustments, and amortization of intangibles in connection with our Voyantic Oy acquisition.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we further revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude settlement income. We have excluded these items because we do not believe they reflect our core operations and us\nexcluding them enables more consistent evaluation of our operating performance. The revision to our definition of adjusted EBITDA did not impact adjusted EBITDA for any previously reported periods because there was no impact\nof a similar nature in such prior periods affecting comparability.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\nWe define non-GAAP net income as net income (loss), excluding, if applicable for the periods presented, the effects of stock-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; restructuring costs; settlement income and related\ncosts; induced conversion expense; acquisition related expense and related purchase accounting adjustments; and the corresponding income tax impacts of adjustments to net income (loss).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income to adjust for acquisition related expenses, related purchase accounting adjustments, and amortization of intangibles in connection with\nour Voyantic Oy acquisition. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we further revised our definition of non-GAAP net income to exclude settlement income. The revisions to our definition of non-GAAP net income did not\nimpact non-GAAP net income for any previously reported periods because there was no impact of a similar nature in such prior periods affecting comparability.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to adjust for income tax effects of adjustments to net income (loss), calculated at the statutory rate for current and\nhistorical periods. We have revised the prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation.\nFree cash flow\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less purchases of property and equipment. We define adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow less cash received\nfrom gain on litigation settlement.\nPage 6\nIMPINJ, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES\n(in thousands, except per share data, unaudited)\n2023 2024\nQ1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 12/31 Q1 Q2 Q3 YTD\nGAAP Net income (loss) $ (4,358) $ (8,066) $ (15,762) $ (15,180) $ (43,366) $ 3 3,344 $ 9 ,963 $ 2 21 $ 43,528\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 1 ,793 4 ,273 3 ,668 3 ,889 1 3,623 3 ,909 2 ,999 3 ,247 10,155\nStock-based compensation 1 0,224 1 3,148 1 2,307 1 2,307 4 7,986 1 1,790 1 4,705 1 4,841 41,336\nRestructuring costs — — — — — 1 ,812 — — 1,812\nAcquisition related expenses 1 ,042 6 30 4 1 ,596 3 ,272 9 07 7 9 — 986\nPurchase accounting adjustments — 2 76 1 12 — 3 88 — — — —\nOther income, net (1,365) (1,165) (1,090) (1,024) (4,644) (1,292) (2,122) (2,416) (5,830)\nIncome from settlement of litigation — — — — — (45,000) — — (45,000)\nInterest expense 1 ,209 1 ,211 1 ,213 1 ,215 4 ,848 1 ,216 1 ,217 1 ,219 3,652\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 7 2 (349) (195) 1 50 (322) (1) (12) 2 07 194\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 8 ,617 $ 9 ,958 $ 2 57 $ 2 ,953 $ 2 1,785 $ 6 ,685 $ 2 6,829 $ 1 7,319 $ 50,833\nGAAP Net income (loss) $ (4,358) $ (8,066) $ (15,762) $ (15,180) $ (43,366) $ 3 3,344 $ 9 ,963 $ 2 21 $ 43,528\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 1 ,793 4 ,273 3 ,668 3 ,889 1 3,623 3 ,909 2 ,999 3 ,247 10,155\nStock-based compensation 1 0,224 1 3,148 1 2,307 1 2,307 4 7,986 1 1,790 1 4,705 1 4,841 41,336\nRestructuring costs — — — — — 1 ,812 — — 1,812\nAcquisition transaction expenses 1 ,042 6 30 4 1 ,596 3 ,272 9 07 7 9 — 986\nPurchase accounting adjustments — 2 76 1 12 — 3 88 — — — —\nIncome from settlement of litigation — — — — — (45,000) — — (45,000)\nIncome tax effects of adjustments (1) (818) (965) (207) (110) (2,100) (591) (2,433) (1,410) (4,434)\nNon-GAAP Net income $ 7 ,883 $ 9 ,296 $ 1 22 $ 2 ,502 $ 1 9,803 $ 6 ,171 $ 2 5,313 $ 1 6,899 $ 48,383\nNon-GAAP Net income per share:\nBasic $ 0.30 $ 0.35 $ 0.00 $ 0.09 $ 0.74 $ 0.23 $ 0.91 $ 0.60 $ 1.74\nDiluted $ 0 .28 $ 0 .33 $ 0 .00 $ 0 .09 $ 0 .70 $ 0 .21 $ 0 .83 (1) $ 0 .56 (1) $ 1.63 (1)\n(1) The tax effects of the adjustments are calculated using the statutory rate, taking into consideration the nature of the item and relevant taxing jurisdiction.\nGAAP and non-GAAP weighted-average shares — basic 2 6,285 2 6,713 2 6,920 2 7,089 2 6,752 2 7,357 2 7,889 2 8,168 27,805\nGAAP Weighted-average shares — diluted 2 6,285 2 6,713 2 6,920 2 7,089 2 6,752 3 1,425 2 9,422 2 9,727 31,918 (2)\nDilutive shares from stock plans 2 ,268 1 ,809 1 ,196 1 ,255 1 ,632 — — — —\nAnti-dilutive shares from convertible debt — — — — — (2,589) 2 ,589 2 ,589 —\nNon-GAAP Weighted-average shares — diluted 2 8,553 2 8,522 2 8,116 2 8,344 2 8,384 2 8,836 3 2,011 (1) 3 2,316 (1) 31,918 (1)\n(1) Diluted net income per share includes the impact of our convertible debt using the if-converted method, which assumes full share settlement.

financial statements.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIMPINJ, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include Impinj, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated\nintercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We have prepared these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), regarding\ninterim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have\nbeen condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in Impinj,\nInc.’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 12, 2024.\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, comprising normal recurring\nadjustments, necessary to state fairly our financial position, results of operations and our cash flows for the periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily\nindicative of the results for a full year or for any other future period.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during\nthe periods presented. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, sales incentives, percentage completion\nof development contracts, inventory excess and obsolescence, income taxes and fair value of stock awards. To the extent there are material differences between\nour estimates, judgments, or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.\nLicensing of Intellectual Property\nOn March 13, 2024, we and NXP Semiconductors N.V. (\"NXP\") entered into a Settlement and Patent Cross-License Agreement (the “Settlement\nAgreement”). Under the Settlement Agreement, NXP made a one-time payment of $45 million and agreed to make annual license fee payments on April 1 of\neach year, starting on April 1, 2024, until the termination of the Settlement Agreement. The annual license fee payment for 2024 was $15 million and will\nincrease each subsequent year by a fixed percentage. We allocated the consideration from the Settlement Agreement to the related components of the agreement.\nDuring first-quarter 2024, we recorded the $45 million payment in income from settlement of litigation in the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nupon receipt. We will recognize the license fee, which relates to annual usage of the license from April 1 to March 31 of each applicable year, as revenue in the\nsecond quarter of each until the Settlement Agreement terminates. We recognized the license fee for the first annual usage period in second-quarter 2024.\nWe recognize revenue from licensing the right to use functional intellectual property, such as the Settlement Agreement discussed above, at the point in\ntime the control of the license transfers to the customer, which is generally upon delivery, or as usage occurs. See Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies for\nadditional details of the Settlement Agreement with NXP.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB released ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which\namends reportable segment requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, including for public entities that have a\nsingle reportable segment. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB released ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which amends income tax\ndisclosure requirements to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness for users of the financial statements. The standard is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 31, 2024. We are currently evaluating impact of this standard, if any, on our financial statement disclosures.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNote 2. Fair Value Measurements\nAccounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or\nmost advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The standards also establish a fair value hierarchy,\nwhich requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three\nlevels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n• Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 — Assets and liabilities valued based on observable market data for similar instruments, such as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities.\n• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity; instruments valued based on the best available data, some of\nwhich is internally developed, and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.\nWe do not have any financial assets or liabilities in Level 3 as of September 30, 2024, and only had the liability for the earnout consideration related to\nthe Voyantic Oy acquisition in Level 3 as of December 31, 2023. We classified this liability as Level 3 because we determined the fair value using significant\nunobservable inputs.\nWe applied the following methods and assumptions in estimating our fair value measurements:\nCash Equivalents — Cash equivalents comprise highly liquid investments, including money market funds with original maturities of less than three\nmonths at the acquisition date. We record the fair value measurement of these assets based on quoted market prices in active markets.\nInvestments — Our investments comprise fixed income securities, which include U.S. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds,\ncommercial paper, treasury bills and asset-backed securities. The fair value measurement of these assets is based on observable market-based inputs or inputs\nthat are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLong-term Debt — See Note 7 for the carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Notes.\nContingent Consideration — The contingent consideration liability is related to our acquisition of Voyantic Oy (see Note 4: Goodwill and Intangible\nAssets). We paid the contingent consideration amount of $7.2 million in second-quarter 2024.\nThe following table presents the balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level within the fair value hierarchy, as\nof the dates presented (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 1,299 $ — $ — $ 1,299 $ 78,661 $ — $ — $ 78,661\nU.S. Treasury securities — 7,973 — 7,973 — — — —\nCommercial paper — 30,815 — 30,815 — — — —\nTotal cash equivalents 1,299 38,788 — 40,087 78,661 — — 78,661\nShort-term investments:\nU.S. Government agency securities — 3,898 — 3,898 — 11,893 — 11,893\nU.S. Treasury securities — 60,149 — 60,149 — — — —\nYankee bonds — — — — — 1,951 — 1,951\nAgency bonds — — — — — 2,994 — 2,994\nAsset-backed securities — — — — — 1,602 — 1,602\nCorporate notes and bonds — 24,656 — 24,656 — — — —\nCommercial paper — 7,848 — 7,848 — — — —\nTotal short-term investments — 96,551 — 96,551 — 18,440 — 18,440\nLong-term investments:\nU.S. Government agency securities — 2,000 — 2,000 — — — —\nU.S. Treasury securities — 8,456 — 8,456 — — — —\nCorporate notes and bonds — 46,666 — 46,666 — — — —\nTotal long-term investments — 57,122 — 57,122 — — — —\nTotal $ 1,299 $ 192,461 $ — $ 193,760 $ 78,661 $ 18,440 $ — $ 97,101\nAcquisition related contingent consideration\nliability — — — — — — 6,180 6,180\nTotal liabilities at fair value $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 6,180 $ 6,180\n10\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents additional information about liabilities measured at fair value for which the Company used Level 3 inputs to determine fair\nvalue (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September\n30,\n2024\nBalance as of January 1 $ 6,180\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liability due to remeasurement 986\nContingent consideration payment made (7,166)\nBalance as of September 30 $ —\nAt the acquisition date, we recorded the contingent consideration related to the Voyantic Oy acquisition at its fair value using unobservable inputs and\nused the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing framework, incorporating contractual terms and assumptions regarding financial forecasts, discount rates and\nvolatility of forecasted revenue and gross margins. Developing and determining the unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair-value measurements and fair-value\ncalculations is management's responsibility with assistance from a third-party valuation specialist. During second-quarter 2024, we paid the contingent\nconsideration and as of September 30, 2024, the contingent consideration liability is $0.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the contingent consideration liability was $6.2 million.\nWe expect short-term investments to mature within 1 year and long-term investments within 1 to 3 years of the reporting date.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nOn April 3, 2023, we acquired all outstanding equity of Voyantic Oy for an aggregate purchase price of $32.7 million. Our acquisition of Voyantic Oy\nadds label design, manufacturing and testing to our systems offerings, to advance the quality, reliability and readability of partner inlays. The consideration\ncomprised (i) $3.6 million in shares of our common stock valued using the market price on the date of the acquisition, (ii) $4.6 million in deferred payments\ncontingent upon revenue and gross margin performance over a one-year period from the acquisition date and (iii) the remainder in cash paid at closing.\nWe recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. We recorded the excess of the purchase\nprice over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill. The fair value of net assets acquired, goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax liability\nwere $2.4 million, $15.6 million, $18.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively. The goodwill amount represents synergies we expect to realize from the business\ncombination and assembled workforce. We allocated the goodwill to our one reporting unit and reportable segment. The acquired goodwill and intangible assets\nwere not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe transaction-related costs for the acquisition were $0 and $1.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These costs are\nrelated to the revaluation of the contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date and are included in general and administrative expenses in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. See Note 2. Fair Value Measures for additional information on the contingent consideration.\nThis acquisition did not have a material impact on our reported revenue or net loss amounts for any period presented; therefore, we have not presented\nhistorical and pro forma disclosures.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the\npurchase method of accounting.

Commitments and Contingencies\nFor information on our commitments and contingencies, see Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, Commitments and\nContingencies) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes to our commitments and\ncontingencies as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, except for “Obligations with Third Parties”\nand “Litigation” as discussed below.\nObligations with Third Parties\nWe manufacture products with third-party manufacturers. We are committed to purchase $32.9 million of inventory as of September 30, 2024.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings or claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue a liability when\nmanagement believes that it is both probable that we have incurred a liability and we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, we did not have accrued contingency liabilities. The following is a description of our significant legal proceedings.\nPatent Infringement Claims and Counterclaims\nImpinj Patent Infringement Claims Against NXP\nFrom 2019 to 2023, we engaged in active patent litigation against our primary endpoint IC competitor, NXP Semiconductors N.V., or NXP. During this\ntime, we filed three patent infringement lawsuits against subsidiaries of NXP in federal courts in California and Texas. Our complaints alleged that certain NXP\nendpoint ICs infringed a number of our U.S. patents. In response, NXP filed a suit against us in federal court in Delaware, later transferred to Washington,\ncountersued us in Texas, and filed three lawsuits against our subsidiary in China. NXP’s complaints alleged that certain of our endpoint ICs infringed a number\nof their own U.S. or Chinese patents or U.S. patents that they exclusively licensed from a third-party to assert against us.\nThrough 2023, we prevailed in these lawsuits. In three U.S. trials held in 2023, juries in California and Texas returned verdicts that NXP endpoint ICs\ninfringed five of our patents that made it to trial, and juries in Washington and Texas ruled that we did not infringe any of the three patents NXP accused us in\ncourt of infringing. Also in 2023, NXP withdrew all three cases it filed against us in China.\nOn March 13, 2024, while additional trials were pending in China and Texas, and post-trial motions and appeals were pending in China and the U.S., we\nand NXP entered into the Settlement Agreement. Under the agreement we and NXP agreed to terminate and withdraw all pending proceedings and release one\nanother for all patent infringement claims preceding March 31, 2024 and grant to each other non-exclusive, worldwide patent licenses to make, have made,\nimport, use, offer for sale, and sell their respective products and services, subject to the terms of the agreement. The Settlement Agreement will remain in force\nuntil all the valid claims of a specified set of Impinj patents (the “Indicator Patents”) expire in about ten years. Either party can terminate the Settlement\nAgreement if the other party materially breaches the terms of the Agreement and NXP can terminate the Settlement Agreement if it successfully designs out all\nvalid claims of the Indicator Patents.\nUnder the Settlement Agreement, NXP paid us a one-time amount of $45 million and agreed to make annual license fee payments, if the specified set of\nIndicator Patents are still in use, on April 1 of each year, effective April 1, 2024. The annual license fee will increase by a fixed percentage each year after 2024\nfor the remaining term of the Settlement Agreement. We have no obligation to pay NXP under the Settlement Agreement.\nWe allocated the consideration from the Settlement Agreement to the components of the Settlement Agreement. We recorded the $45 million payment in\nincome from settlement of litigation in the condensed consolidated statements of operations in first-quarter 2024, upon receipt. Licensing of our intellectual\nproperty is part of our ongoing operations and therefore, we will recognize the license fee, which relates to annual usage of the license from April 1 to March 31\nof each applicable year, as revenue in the second quarter of each year until the Settlement Agreement terminates. We recognized the first annual license fee of\n$15 million in revenue in second-quarter 2024.\n14\nTable of Contents\nNote 7. Long-term debt\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn November 2021, we issued $287.5 million aggregate principal amount of convertible promissory notes due May 15, 2027 (the “2021 Notes”).\nThe following table presents the outstanding principal amount and carrying value of the 2021 Notes as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUnamortized Unamortized\nPrincipal Net Carrying Principal Net Carrying\nAmount\ndebt issuance\nAmount Amount\ndebt issuance\nAmount\ncosts costs\n2021 Notes 287,500 (4,419) 283,081 287,500 (5,645) 281,855\nFurther details of the 2021 Notes are as follows:\nInitial Conversion Initial\nFirst Interest Effective Semi-Annual Interest Number of Shares\nIssuance Maturity Date Interest Rate Rate per $1,000 Conversion\nPayment Date Interest Rate Payment Dates (in millions)\nPrincipal Price\n2021 Notes May 15, 2027 1.125% May 15, 2022 1.72% May 15; November 15 9.0061 $ 111.04 2.6\nThe 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations, do not contain any financial covenants and are governed by indentures (the Indentures). The total net\nproceeds from the 2021 Notes, after deducting initial debt issuance costs, fees and expenses, was $278.4 million. We used approximately $183.6 million of the\n2021 Notes net proceeds, excluding accrued interest, to repurchase approximately $76.4 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2026 (the\n“2019 Notes” and, together with the 2021 Notes, the “Notes”) through individual privately negotiated transactions concurrent with us offering the 2021 Notes.\nWe used approximately $17.6 million, excluding accrued interest, to repurchase the remaining $9.9 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes in\nJune 2022. We will use the remainder of the net proceeds from the 2021 Notes for general corporate purposes.\nTerms of the 2021 Notes\nThe holders of the 2021 Notes may convert their respective 2021 Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day\nimmediately preceding the respective conversion dates under the following circumstances:\n• during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2022 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale\nprice of our common stock, for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and\nincluding, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable\ntrading day;\n• during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021\nNotes for each trading day was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such\ntrading day;\n• prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date if we call the 2021 Notes for\nredemption; or\n• upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as described in the indenture.\nRegardless of the foregoing circumstances, holders may convert all or any portion of the 2021 Notes, in increments of $1,000 principal amount, on or\nafter February 15, 2027, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.\nWe may redeem all or a portion of the 2021 Notes for cash, at our option, on or after November 20, 2024, if the last reported sale price of our common\nstock has been at least 130% of the conversion price at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period at a\nredemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes being redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the\nredemption date.\nHolders who convert their 2021 Notes in connection with certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the\nindenture) are, under certain circumstances, entitled to an increase in the conversion rate. Additionally in the event of a corporate event constituting a\nfundamental change (as defined in the indenture), holders of the 2021 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2021 Notes at a repurchase\nprice equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\n15\nTable of Contents\nOur common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the 2021 Notes for more than 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days\nended September 30, 2024. Accordingly, the 2021 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders as of September 30, 2024 and therefore, have remained\nclassified as current portion of long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The “if-converted value” exceeded the\nprincipal amounts by $273.1 million based on the closing price of our common stock of $216.52 as of September 30, 2024.\nInterest expense related to the Notes was as follows (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n2021 Notes 2021 Notes 2021 Notes 2021 Notes\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 410 404 1,226 1,206\nCash interest expense 809 809 2,426 2,427\nTotal interest expense $ 1,219 $ 1,213 $ 3,652 $ 3,633\nAccrued interest related to the 2021 Notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $1.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively. We record\naccrued interest in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe estimate the fair value of the 2021 Notes to be $576.5 million and $314.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively,\nwhich we determined through consideration of quoted market prices. The fair value for the 2021 Notes is classified as Level 2, as defined in Note 2.\nCapped Calls\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2019 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped-call transactions with certain financial counterparties.\nThe capped call transactions are generally designed to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the 2019 Notes,\nor to offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, as the case may be, with the\nreduction or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. If, however, the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price of the capped-call\ntransactions, then our stock would experience some dilution and/or the capped call would not fully offset the potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent\nthen-market price per share of our common stock exceeds the cap price. The capped call remains outstanding even though we have repurchased the 2019 Notes.\nThe initial cap price of the capped call transactions is $54.20 per share, subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The\ncapped call transactions expire over 40 consecutive scheduled trading days ending on December 11, 2026. The capped call transactions meet the criteria for\nclassification in equity, are not accounted for as derivatives and are not remeasured each reporting period.\n16\nTable of Contents\nNote 8.

And a world in which the ownership, history and linked information for every one of those items is seamlessly available to\nenterprises and people. We call our expansive vision a Boundless Internet of Things, or IoT. We design and sell a platform that enables that wireless item-to-\ncloud connectivity and with which we and our partners innovate Internet of Things, or IoT, solutions.\nWe have enabled connectivity for more than 100 billion items to date, delivering item visibility and improving operational efficiencies for retailers,\nsupply chain and logistics, or SC&L providers, restaurants and food-service providers, airlines, automobile manufacturers, healthcare companies and many\nmore. We are today focused on extending item connectivity from tens of billions to trillions of items, and delivering item data not just to enterprises but to\npeople, so they too can derive value from their connected items. We believe the Boundless IoT we are enabling will, in the not-too-distant future, give people\nubiquitous access to cloud-based digital twins of every item, each storing the item’s history and linked information and helping people explore and learn about\nthe item. We believe that that connectivity will transform the world.\nWe and our partner ecosystem build item-visibility solutions using products that we design and either sell or license, including silicon RAIN radios;\nmanufacturing, test, encoding and reading systems, software and cloud services that encapsulate our solutions know-how and intellectual property. We sell two\ntypes of silicon integrated circuit, or IC, radios. The first are endpoint ICs that store a serialized number to wirelessly identify an item. Our partners embed\nendpoint ICs into an item or its packaging. The ICs may also contain a cryptographic key to authenticate the item. The second are reader ICs that our partners\nuse in finished readers to wirelessly discover, inventory and engage the endpoint ICs. Those readers may also protect an item or consumer, for example by\nauthenticating the item as genuine or privatizing the item by rendering the endpoint IC unresponsive without the consumer first providing a password. Our\nmanufacturing, test and encoding systems enable partner products and facilitate enterprise deployments. Our reading\n19\nTable of Contents\nsystems comprise high-performance finished readers and gateways for autonomous reading solutions. Our software and cloud services focus on solutions\nenablement.\nWe sell our products, individually or as a whole platform offering primarily with or through our partner ecosystem. That ecosystem comprises original\nequipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tag service bureaus, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, systems integrators, or SIs, value-added resellers, or VARs,\nindependent software vendors, or ISVs, and other solution partners.\nOur silicon radios follow the RAIN industry’s air-interface standard for their core functionality. We create partner and enterprise preference for our radios and\nsolutions by adding differentiated features into our products, and supporting or licensing those features across our platform, to deliver solutions capabilities and\nperformance that surpasses mix-and-match solutions built from competitor products.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nInventory Supply\nMost of our revenue derives from endpoint ICs that our partners embed into or onto enterprise items and is therefore affected by macroeconomic trends.\nFurther, we sell most of our products, both endpoint ICs and systems, through partners and distributors, limiting our visibility to enterprise demand. We work\nclosely with those partners and distributors to gain as accurate a view as possible, however, correctly forecasting demand for our products and identifying\nmarket shifts in a timely manner remains a challenge. As a result, we sometimes experience inventory overages or shortages. Inventory overages can increase\nexpenses, expose us to product obsolescence and/or increased reserves and negatively affect our business. Inventory shortages can cause long lead times,\nmissed opportunities, market-share losses and/or damaged customer relationships, also negatively affecting our business.\nIn 2021 and 2022, demand for our endpoint ICs increased while worldwide wafer demand also increased, leading to wafer shortfalls for many\nsemiconductor companies, including us. These wafer shortfalls prevented us from fully meeting customer demand and, in some cases, caused customers to\ncancel orders, qualify alternative suppliers or purchase from our competitors. In 2023, macroeconomic conditions led to softness in demand and inventory\noverages.\nProduct Adoption and Unit Growth Rates\nEnterprises have significantly adopted RAIN in retail apparel, our largest market, and SC&L, but the rate of adoption and unit growth rates have been\nuneven and unpredictable. From 2010 to 2023, our overall endpoint IC sales volumes increased at a 26% compounded annual growth rate; however, we have\nexperienced uneven growth rates in various periods.\nRegardless of the uneven pace of retail, SC&L and other industry adoption and growth rates, we believe the long-term trend is continued RAIN adoption\nand growth and we intend to continue investing in developing new products and expanding our product offerings for the foreseeable future. However, we\ncannot predict whether historical annual growth rates are indicative of the pace of future growth.\nOur systems business, at least for readers and gateways, depends significantly on large-scale deployments at discrete end users, and deployment timing\ncauses large yearly variability in our systems revenue. For example, we generated 14% of total 2019 revenue from a gateway deployment at a large North\nAmerican SC&L provider. We did not have comparable project-based revenue in 2020. Similarly, in second-quarter 2021, we generated 13% of our revenue\nfrom a project-based gateway deployment for RAIN-based self-checkout and loss prevention at a large Europe-based global retailer. We did not have\ncomparable project-based revenue in 2022, 2023 or in the first three quarters of 2024.\nSeasonality and Pricing\nWe typically negotiate pricing with most of our endpoint IC OEMs with an effective date of the first quarter of the calendar year. In the past, this\nnegotiation typically resulted in reduced revenue and gross margins in the first quarter compared to prior periods, which then normalized in subsequent quarters\nas we reduced costs and adjust product mix by migrating those OEMs and end users to newer, lower-cost products.\nEndpoint IC volumes tend to be lower in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. System sales tend to be higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the\nfirst quarter, we believe due to the availability of residual funding for capital expenditures prior to the end of many end users’ fiscal years.\nWe did not see these seasonal trends in 2023. We do expect continued quarter-to-quarter revenue variability due to changing macroeconomic conditions\nand timing of program launches that could impact seasonal trends in the future.\n20\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our results of operations for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue $ 95,198 $ 65,005 $ 30,193 $ 274,518 $ 236,888 $ 37,630\nGross profit $ 47,569 $ 30,768 $ 16,801 $ 142,633 $ 118,112 $ 24,521\nGross margin 50.0% 47.3% 2.7% 52.0% 49.9% 2.1%\nLoss from operations $ (769) $ (15,834) $ 15,065 $ (3,456) $ (28,645) $ 25,189\nThree months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue and gross profit increased, due primarily to higher endpoint IC revenue partially offset by lower systems revenue. The endpoint IC revenue\nincrease was driven primarily by higher endpoint IC shipment volumes when compared to the prior-year period. Systems revenue decreased, due primarily to\nlower shipment volumes. Gross margin increased, due primarily to lower excess and obsolescence charges in the current-year period compared to the prior-year\nperiod. Loss from operations decreased, due primarily to increased gross profit, partially offset by increased operating expenses. The operating expense increase\nwas due to higher research and development costs, partially offset by lower general and administrative costs, sales and marketing costs and amortization of\nintangibles.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with nine months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue and gross profit increased, due primarily to higher endpoint IC revenue partially offset by lower systems revenue.

Income tax expense increased $0.4 million and $0.7\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods due to changes in our estimated effective tax\nrate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur key non-GAAP performance measures include adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income (loss), as defined below. We use adjusted EBITDA and\nnon-GAAP net income (loss) as key measures to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget\nand to develop short- and long-term operating plans. We believe these measures provide useful information for period-to-period comparisons of our business to\nallow investors and others to understand and evaluate our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Our presentation of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and\nour non-GAAP measures may be different from similarly termed non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding, if applicable for the periods presented, the effects of\nstock-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; restructuring costs; settlement income and related costs; induced conversion expense; other income,\nnet; interest expense; acquisition related expense and related purchase accounting adjustments; and income tax benefit (expense). During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to exclude acquisition related expenses, related purchase accounting adjustments and\namortization of intangibles in connection with our Voyantic Oy acquisition. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we further revised our definition of\nadjusted EBITDA to exclude settlement income. We have excluded these items because we do not believe they reflect our core operations and us excluding\nthem enables more consistent evaluation of our operating performance. The revision to our definition of adjusted EBITDA did not impact adjusted EBITDA for\nany previously reported periods because there was no impact of a similar nature in such prior periods affecting comparability.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nNet income (loss) $ 221 $ (15,762) $ 15,983 $ 43,528 $ (28,186) $ 71,714\nAdjustments:\nOther income, net (2,416) (1,090) (1,326) (5,830) (3,620) (2,210)\nInterest expense 1,219 1,213 6 3,652 3,633 19\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 207 (195) 402 194 (472) 666\nDepreciation and amortization 3,247 3,668 (421) 10,155 9,734 421\nStock-based compensation 14,841 12,307 2,534 41,336 35,679 5,657\nRestructuring costs — — — 1,812 — 1,812\nAcquisition related expense — 4 (4) 986 1,676 (690)\nPurchase accounting adjustments — 112 (112) — 388 (388)\nIncome on settlement of litigation — — — (45,000) — (45,000)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 17,319 $ 257 $ 17,062 $ 50,833 $ 18,832 $ 32,001\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\nWe define non-GAAP net income as net income (loss), excluding, if applicable for the periods presented, the effects of stock-based compensation;\ndepreciation and amortization; restructuring costs; settlement income and related costs; induced conversion expense; acquisition related expense and related\npurchase accounting adjustments; and the corresponding income tax impacts of adjustments to net income (loss).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income to adjust for acquisition related expenses, related\npurchase accounting adjustments and amortization of intangibles in connection with our Voyantic Oy acquisition. During the three months ended March 31,\n2024, we further revised our definition of non-GAAP net income to exclude settlement income. The revisions to our definition of non-GAAP net income did not\nimpact non-GAAP net income for any previously reported periods because there was no impact of a similar nature in such prior periods affecting comparability.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we revised our definition of non-GAAP net income (loss) to adjust for income tax effects of\nadjustments to net income (loss), calculated at the statutory rate for current and historical periods. We have revised the prior period amounts to conform to our\ncurrent period presentation.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP net income (loss):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nNet income (loss) $ 221 $ (15,762) $ 15,983 $ 43,528 $ (28,186) $ 71,714\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization 3,247 3,668 (421) 10,155 9,734 421\nStock-based compensation 14,841 12,307 2,534 41,336 35,679 5,657\nRestructuring costs — — — 1,812 — 1,812\nAcquisition related expense — 4 (4) 986 1,676 (690)\nPurchase accounting adjustments — 112 (112) — 388 (388)\nIncome on settlement of litigation — — — (45,000) — (45,000)\nIncome tax effects of adjustments (1) (1,410) (207) (1,203) (4,434) (1,990) (2,444)\nNon-GAAP net income $ 16,899 $ 122 $ 16,777 $ 48,383 $ 17,301 $ 31,082\n(1) The tax effects of the adjustments are calculated using the statutory rate, taking into consideration the nature of the item and relevant taxing jurisdiction.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $170.3 million, comprising cash deposits held at major financial\ninstitutions and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including U.S. government securities, treasury bills, corporate notes and bonds, commercial\npaper, and money market funds. As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of $(2.0) million, down from $39.4 million as of June 30, 2024. The\ndecrease was driven by purchases of long-term investments in third-quarter 2024.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and by issuing equity securities, convertible-debt offerings\nand/or borrowing under our prior senior credit facility.\nWe believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our\nanticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the longer term, we plan to continue investing to enhance and extend our platform. If our available\nfunds are insufficient to fund our future activities or execute our strategy, then we may raise additional capital through equity, equity-linked or debt financing, to\nthe extent such funding sources are available. Alternatively, we may need to reduce expenses to manage liquidity; however, any such reductions could adversely\nimpact our business and competitive position.\nSources of Funds\nFrom time to time, we may explore additional financing sources and ways to reduce our cost of capital, including equity, equity-linked and debt\nfinancing. In addition, in connection with any future acquisitions, we may pursue additional financing which may be debt, equity or equity-linked financing or a\ncombination thereof. We can provide no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms.\n2021 Notes\nIn November 2021, we issued convertible notes due 2027 in an aggregate principal amount of $287.5 million which we refer to as the 2021 Notes. The\n2021 Notes are our senior unsecured obligation, bearing interest at a fixed rate of 1.125% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November\n15 of each year, beginning on May 15, 2022. The 2021 Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election,\nand will mature on May 15, 2027 unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with the indenture terms.\nThe net proceeds from the 2021 Notes were approximately $278.4 million after initial debt issuance costs, fees and expenses. We used approximately\n$183.6 million of the net proceeds to repurchase approximately $76.4 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due 2026, or the 2019 Notes,\nthrough individual privately negotiated transactions concurrent with the 2021 Notes offering. We used $17.6 million to repurchase the remaining $9.85 million\naggregate principal of the 2019 Notes through individual privately negotiated transactions in June 2022. We will use the rest of the net proceeds for general\ncorporate purposes.\nFor further information on the terms of this debt, please refer to Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nreport.\n27\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 115,687 $ (50,809)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (148,705) 101,480\nNet cash provided by financing activities 11,897 7,890\nOperating Cash Flows\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated $115.7 million of net cash from operating activities. These net cash proceeds were due\nprimarily to $96.9 million of net income adjusted for non-cash items and $18.8 million in working capital due primarily to higher accounts payable, accrued\ncompensation and lower inventory, partially offset by higher accounts receivable.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used $50.8 million of net cash from operating activities. This net cash usage was due primarily to\n$67.0 million in working capital due primarily to higher inventory and lower accounts payable and $16.2 million of net loss adjusted for non-cash items.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used $148.7 million of net cash from investing activities. This net cash usage was due to purchases\nof investments of $154.3 million, cash paid for equipment purchases of $13.0 million, partially offset by cash generated by investment maturities of $18.6\nmillion.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $101.5 million of net cash from investing activities. These net cash proceeds were due\nprimarily to investment maturities of $127.5 million and investment sales of $13.4 million, partially offset by cash paid for the Voyantic Oy acquisition of $23.4\nmillion and net property and equipment purchases of $16.0 million.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated $11.9 million of net cash from financing activities. These net cash proceeds were due to\nstock-option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan, offset by $4.6 million of cash paid for the earnout payment related to the Voyantic Oy acquisition.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated $7.9 million of net cash from financing activities. These net cash proceeds were due\nprimarily to $7.9 million from stock-option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan.\nCash Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nOur primary cash requirements are for operating expenses and capital expenditures. Our operating expenses have generally increased as we invest in\ndeveloping products and technologies that we believe have the potential to drive long-term business growth.\nConvertible Notes – As of September 30, 2024 the principal balance outstanding on the 2021 Notes is $287.5 million. Refer to Note 7 of our Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for maturity date, stated interest rate and additional information on our\n2021 Notes.\nOperating Lease Obligations – Our lease portfolio comprises primarily operating leases for our office space. For additional information regarding our\noperating leases, see Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nPurchase Commitments – Purchase commitments as of September 30, 2024 total $32.9 million and comprise noncancelable commitments to purchase\ninventory.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nSince inception, we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special-purpose\nentities, or financial partnerships that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or for another contractually\nnarrow or limited purpose.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates\nWe have prepared our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these financial statements requires us\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,\n28\nTable of Contents\nexpenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various\nother assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. For\ninformation on our critical accounting policies and estimates, see Part II, Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business.\nInterest Rate Risk\nUnder our current investment policy, we invest our excess cash in money market funds, U.S. government securities, corporate bonds and notes and\ncommercial paper. Our current investment policy seeks first to preserve principal, second to provide liquidity for our operating and capital needs and third to\nmaximize yield without putting our principal at risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $170.3 million as of September 30, 2024. Our investments are exposed to market risk due\nto fluctuations in prevailing interest rates, which may reduce the yield on our investments or their fair value. Because most of our investment portfolio is short-\nterm in nature, we do not believe an immediate 10% increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and\ntherefore we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates.\nOur convertible notes have fixed interest rates, thus a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not impact interest expense.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. To date, we have been able to\nsubstantially offset higher product costs by increasing our product selling prices. If our product costs became subject to significant future inflationary pressures,\nthen we may not be able to fully offset these higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n29\nTable of Contents\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency and the effects of translating\namounts denominated in a foreign currency to the U.S. dollar as a normal part of our reporting process. The functional currency of the majority of our foreign\nsubsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from remeasuring transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are\nincluded in other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. One of our European subsidiaries utilize Euros as their functional currency, which\nresults in a translation adjustment that we include as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. For any of the periods presented, we did not\nhave material impact from exposure to foreign currency fluctuation. As we grow operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely become more\nsignificant.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to management, including its\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024.\nLimitations on Controls\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the\ndesired control objectives. Our management recognizes that any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain judgments\nand assumptions and cannot provide absolute assurance that its objectives will be met. Similarly, an evaluation of controls cannot provide absolute assurance\nthat misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\n30\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nIn the normal course of business, we may be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints. We cannot predict whether any resulting\nliability will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position or stock price.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report, including the section of this report\ncaptioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and related notes. If any of\nthe events described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report occur, then our business, operating results and financial\ncondition could be materially impacted. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could\ndiffer materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to factors that are described below and elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Relating to Our Platform, Products and Technologies\nWe operate in a very competitive market.\nOur primary competitors are:\n• Endpoint ICs: NXP, EM Microelectronic, Kiloway, Quanray, Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group, Alibaba and Alien.\n• Reader ICs: Phychips Inc, Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group and MagicRF.\n• Readers and gateways: Zebra.\n• Test and measurement systems: CISC.\nThese competitors include companies that have much greater financial, operating, research and development, marketing and other resources than us. To\ngain market share, they could discount their products and accept lower margins, or they could maintain margins by achieving cost savings through better, more\nefficient designs or production methods. They could devote more resources than we can to product development, promotion, sales and support. They could also\nbundle other technologies, including those we do not have in our product portfolio, with their RAIN products.\nOur partners, including our OEMs, ODMs, distributors, SIs, VARs and solution partners, may choose to compete with us rather than purchase our\nproducts, which would not only reduce our customer base but also increase competition in the market. Companies in adjacent markets or newly formed\ncompanies may decide to enter our market, particularly as RAIN adoption grows. Further, the Chinese government has made development of the Chinese\nsemiconductor industry a priority, potentially increasing competition for us globally while possibly restricting our ability to participate in the Chinese market.\nRAIN adoption is concentrated in key markets and the extent and pace of RAIN market adoption beyond those markets is uncertain.\nOur financial performance depends on the pace of end-user RAIN adoption in key markets, such as retail apparel (our largest market), retail general\nmerchandise and SC&L. Although RAIN has been adopted to some degree by end users in those markets, those end users as well as the markets themselves are\nsubject to business cycles and macroeconomic trends. Continued RAIN adoption by those end users and in those markets may be at risk if and when negative\nbusiness or economic conditions arise.\nThe RAIN opportunity is still developing. RAIN adoption, as well as adoption of our platform and products, depends on many factors, including the\nextent to which end users understand and embrace the benefits that RAIN offers; whether the benefits of RAIN adoption outweigh the cost and time to replace\nor modify end users’ existing systems and processes; and whether RAIN products and applications meet end users’ current or anticipated needs.\nWe have, at times, anticipated and forecasted a pace of end-user adoption that exceeded the actual pace of adoption. We expect continued difficulty\nforecasting the pace of adoption. As a result, we may be unable to accurately forecast our future operating results including revenue, gross margins, cash flows\nand—profitability, any or all of which could negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe must introduce new products, product enhancements and services to compete effectively.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe introduce new products and services to advance our business, satisfy increasingly demanding end-user requirements and grow RAIN market\nadoption. We commit significant resources developing and introducing these new products and services, and to improving the performance and reliability of,\nand reducing the costs of, our existing products and services.\nWhether our new or enhanced products and services will succeed is uncertain. Our success developing the technologies, processes or capabilities\nnecessary or desired for new or enhanced products and services, or licensing or otherwise acquiring them from third parties, and our ability to introduce new or\nenhanced products and services before our competition, depends on many factors, including:\n• our ability to identify new product capabilities or services that end users will widely adopt;\n• our timely and efficient completion of the design process;\n• our timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing, assembly and testing procedures;\n• our attainment of appropriate product or service performance levels and product certifications;\n• partnering successfully with others to deliver complementary products or services;\n• the quality, reliability and selling price of our product or service; and\n• the effectiveness of our marketing, sales and support.\nWhen we introduce new products and services, our success in ramping adoption depends, in part, on us making those products and services easy for our\npartners and end users to deploy and use. For example, for our new M800-family endpoint ICs, we are currently significantly supporting our inlay partners to\nproduce high-performing, high-quality inlays. Until our partners are able to deploy our products widely, adoption and our operating results could suffer.\nOur ability to deliver enterprise solutions at scale are nascent.\nWe believe we are still at a very early stage in our ability to deliver enterprise solutions. We are developing solutions for retail self-checkout and loss\nprevention and SC&L package routing that have been, or that we expect to be, deployed by the industry-leading enterprise end users. However, to fully\ncapitalize on our platform's potential, we must make our current offerings repeatable across multiple enterprises as well as deliver additional solutions to\nenterprise needs. We must also develop relationships with top-tier solution partners to gain access to and address challenging new use cases. If we do not\nsucceed in identifying, developing, selling and deploying enterprise solutions, particularly solutions that rely on autonomous reading, with top-tier partners and\nend users and across a range of markets and use cases, then our business prospects will suffer.\nDelivering enterprise solutions requires a network of partner products and services that complement our own product offerings and that together address\nenterprise needs. Convincing enterprises to partner with us to solve their business problems—including evaluation, design, deployment, operations and services,\nas well as integrating RAIN data into the enterprise's information systems—requires tight coordination among our and our partners' sales, marketing, operations\nand engineering teams. We, or our partners, may be unable to successfully acquire customers for our enterprise solutions, or successfully address our market\nopportunity. Although we have partners who can successfully introduce our platform, or aspects of it, to their customers, even today their knowledge of our\nplatform and RAIN in general is often still nascent. If we do not build our network of solutions, and partners to deliver those solutions, and broaden our efforts\nto deliver solutions that leverage our platform in large, complex enterprise opportunities, then our business prospects will suffer.\nWe rely on endpoint IC sales to generate most of our revenue.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, most of our revenue from our endpoint ICs. If demand declines, or if we are unable to procure enough\nwafers to meet the demand we have, or if we are unable to raise prices to offset cost increases, then our business and operating results will suffer. In addition,\nthe continued adoption of, and demand for, our endpoint ICs, derives in part from us demonstrating the benefits of using our systems. If we fail to establish\nthose benefits then we may be unsuccessful in countering competitive endpoint IC price pressures and our business and operating results could be adversely\naffected.\nThe average selling prices of our products could fluctuate substantially.\nThe average selling price, or ASP, of our products has historically decreased with time or to meet end-user demands, encourage adoption, address\nmacroeconomic conditions or respond to competitive pressure. As demand for older products declines, or as competition from competitors with lower product\ncosts or lower profitability expectations increases, or during times of oversupply, ASPs may decline quickly.\n32\nTable of Contents\nTo compete profitably we must continually improve our technology and processes, reduce unit costs in line with lower selling prices, and introduce new,\nhigher margin products. If we are unable to offset ASP reductions with increased sales volumes or reduced product costs, or if we are unable to introduce new\nproducts that command higher prices and better gross margins, then our overall revenue and gross margins will suffer.\nThough less common, we have also increased prices from time to time, especially during times of increasing wafer costs. For example, we raised prices\nin 2021, 2022 and 2023 to accommodate higher costs. We may be required to raise prices again if macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, create upward\npressure on our product costs. Increased prices could dampen adoption and market growth.\nPricing commitments and other restrictive provisions in our customer agreements could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into agreements containing pricing terms that could, in some instances, adversely affect our operating\nresults and gross margins. For example, some contracts specify future IC, reader or gateway pricing or contain most-favored-customer pricing for certain\nproducts. Other agreements contain exclusivity terms that prevent us from pursuing certain business with other customers during the exclusivity period.\nReducing prices or offering favorable terms to one customer could adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms with other customers.\nChanges in our product mix could adversely affect our overall gross margin.\nEndpoint IC sales, which constitute and likely will continue to constitute the majority of our product revenue, have, for the most part, lower gross\nmargins than our systems product sales. Our overall product gross margins are affected by product mix, which can fluctuate based on supply and demand,\ncompetitive pressures and end-user needs and demand. A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products to lower margin products, either within our\nendpoint IC product portfolio or from our systems business to our endpoint ICs, could negatively affect our gross margins.\nPoor product quality could result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products.\nOur products must meet increasingly demanding specifications for quality, reliability and performance. Our products are both highly technical and\ndeployed in large, complex systems in which errors, defects or incompatibilities can be problematic for our partners and end users.\nIf we are unable to identify or correct errors, defects, incompatibilities or other problems in our products, we could experience:\n• loss of customer orders or customers;\n• lost or delayed market acceptance (either of our products and solutions or RAIN generally);\n• lost or delayed sales;\n• loss of market share;\n• damage to our brand and reputation;\n• impaired ability to attract new customers;\n• diversion of development resources;\n• increased service and warranty costs;\n• replacement costs;\n• legal actions by our partners or end users; and\n• increased insurance costs.\nMoreover, if we encounter product quality issues, then we may be required to incur significant time and costs to diagnose, test and fix the issues. There\ncan be no assurance that such remediation efforts would be successful. Even if successful, these efforts could further constrain our ability to supply our partners\nand end users with new products until we have resolved the issues.\nEnd users and partners must design our products into their products and business processes.\nPersuading end users or partners to design our products into their business processes or products requires educating them about RAIN’s and our\nproducts’ value. They may use other technologies or products and may not be receptive to introducing RAIN into their business processes or products. Even\nwhen convinced, they often undertake long pilot programs and qualifications prior to placing orders. These pilot programs and qualifications can be time-\nconsuming and expensive, and there is no assurance they will\n33\nTable of Contents\nresult in an order for our products. If we fail to develop new products that adequately or competitively address end users’ or our partners’ needs, then we may\nnot receive product orders, which could adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.\nOur visibility into the length of the sales and deployment cycles for our products is limited.\nWe have limited visibility into end user sales and deployment cycles, and these cycles are often longer than we anticipate. Many factors contribute to our\nlimited visibility, including the time our partners and end users spend evaluating our products, the time educating them on RAIN’s benefits and the time\nintegrating our products with end users’ systems. The length and uncertain timing of the sales and deployment cycles can lead to delayed product orders. In\nanticipation of those orders, we may incur substantial costs before the sales cycle is complete and before we receive any customer orders or payments, if we\nreceive them at all.\nAn inability or limited ability of end user systems to exploit RAIN information may adversely affect the market for our products.\nA successful end-user deployment requires not only tags and readers or gateways, but RAIN integration with information systems and applications that\ncreate business value from the RAIN data. Unless third parties continue developing and advancing business analytics tools, and end users enhance their\ninformation systems to use these tools, RAIN deployments could stall. Our efforts to foster third-party development and deployment of these tools could fail. In\naddition, our guidance to business-analytics providers for integrating our products with their tools could prove ineffective.\nSolution providers and SIs are essential to the RAIN market. They provide deployment know-how to enable end users to successfully deploy RAIN\nsolutions. Integrating our products with end-user information systems could prove more difficult or time-consuming than we or they anticipate, which could\ndelay deployments.\nAlternative technologies may enable products and services that compete with ours.\nTechnology developments may affect our business negatively. Breakthroughs in legacy RFID technologies or markets, including those using low\nfrequency or high frequency RFID technology, or in other radio technologies, could adversely affect RAIN market growth and demand for our products.\nLikewise, new technologies may enable lower-cost ICs than our products. If we are unable to innovate using new or enhanced technologies or are slow to react\nto changes in existing technologies or in the market, or if we have difficulty competing with advances in new or legacy technologies, then our development of\nnew or enhanced products could be impacted and result in product obsolescence, decreased revenue and reduced market share.\nSignificant changes in RAIN standards bodies, standards or qualification processes could impede our ability to sell our products and services.\nWe have historically taken a leadership position in developing RAIN industry standards, including with GS1 and ISO, and have designed our products to\ncomply with those standards. We could lose that leadership position; our influence in standards development could diminish; or we could choose not to\nparticipate in certain standards activities.\nNew or changed industry standards could affect us negatively. If industry standards diverge from our or the RAIN market’s needs, then our products may\nfail to keep pace with the market or cause end users to delay their deployments. Moreover, the adoption or expected adoption of new or changed standards could\nslow sales of our existing products before we can introduce new products that meet the new or changed standards. New standards or changes to existing\nstandards could also limit our ability to implement new features in our products. The lost opportunities as well as time and expense to develop new products or\nchange our existing products to comply with new or changed standards could be substantial, and we may not ultimately succeed in developing products that\ncomply with the new or changed standards.\nCertain organizations develop requirements for RAIN tags and test tags against those requirements. For example, the ARC Program at Auburn\nUniversity develops tag performance and quality requirements for end users that engage them. Some participants in the RAIN market are ARC sponsors, but we\nare not among them. If ARC or a similar organization fails to certify or delays certifying tags incorporating our endpoint ICs, adoption and sales of our products\ncould suffer.\nChanges in government spectrum regulations or in their enforcement could adversely affect our ability to sell our products.\nOur readers and gateways are collectively certified for use in more than 40 countries worldwide, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, China,\nJapan, South Korea and every country in the European Union, or the EU.\nOur products operate in spectrum bands in which governments permit the use of RFID/RAIN technology. If spectrum regulations or the application or\nenforceability or such regulations should change, or if our products were found to be noncompliant despite being certified, we could need to redesign our\nproducts, potentially resulting in significant costs, including costs associated with obsolete inventory. Regulatory changes may also cause us to forego\nopportunities, adversely affecting our business.\nIn April 2024, NextNav Inc. asked the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, to initiate a proceeding that would consider whether to\nreconfigure the 902–928 MHz ISM spectrum, or Lower 900 MHz Band, in which RAIN and other unlicensed\n34\nTable of Contents\nservices operate to enable a terrestrial backup to the U.S. Global Positioning System. To pay for the backup system, NextNav also asked for a license to use\ncertain spectrum bands, including parts of the Lower 900 MHz Band used for RAIN operations, to deliver 5G broadband services. If approved as proposed, this\nISM spectrum reconfiguration could interfere with RAIN radio transmissions and negatively impact the RAIN industry.\nWe and other RAIN providers and end users, as well as other Lower 900 MHz Band users, have already registered our opposition to NextNav’s petition\nand asked the FCC to reject it quickly. If the FCC declines to do so then we expect there to be a protracted decision-making process. The FCC would be\nrequired to consider all relevant comments and material of record before it decides whether to proceed with the proposal, issue a new or modified proposal, or\ntake no action on the proposal. The fate of NextNav’s petition is uncertain at this time, but if the FCC were to adopt NextNav's proposal and customers were not\nable to consistently use our RAIN products without interference, then our business would be significantly and negatively affected.\nSales of some of our products could cannibalize revenue from other products.\nSome of our partners develop products that compete with our products. For example, some of our OEM partners use our reader ICs to build and sell\nreaders and gateways that compete with our readers and gateways. Similarly, some of our partners use our readers to build and sell gateways that compete with\nour gateways. If we fail to manage such conflicts successfully, then our business and operating results could be negatively affected.\nOur licensing program is nascent.\nWhile we believe we have valuable RAIN intellectual property and aspire to monetize that intellectual property by licensing it to third parties, including\nthird parties who compete with us to some extent, our experience in doing so is nascent, and our ability to grow licensing revenue remains subject to numerous\nrisks and uncertainties. To materially grow our licensing program and revenues, we will need to maintain and grow our intellectual property portfolio and\ncontinue to research and develop RAIN innovations that will generate and maintain demand for licenses to our technology and features. We will also need to\ndevelop and maintain an ability to monitor infringement of our intellectual property rights by others and possibly seek enforcement action against those who\nattempt to infringe our intellectual property rights. These enforcement actions could require significant investments in management time and attention as well as\ncash as we incur legal and other expenses. They could also compete with our objectives in other areas of our business such as wanting to maintain close,\nstrategic relationships with important partners or end users of our products. These are just some of the risks and uncertainties we face with respect to our\nnascent licensing program.\nWe currently derive a substantial share of our licensing revenues from NXP, our primary endpoint IC competitor, based on our Settlement Agreement\nwith them. For more information regarding the terms of our Settlement Agreement with NXP, please refer to Note 6 of our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this report. If NXP were to breach its license payment obligations, or if NXP were to design around our intellectual property\nrights and exercise its right to terminate our license before the end of the agreement's 10-year term, our licensing revenues would decline and our overall results\nof operations and cash flows would suffer.\nRisks Relating to Our Personnel and Business Operations\nWe obtain the products we sell through a limited number of third parties with whom we do not have long-term supply contracts.\nOur ability to secure cost-effective, quality products in a timely manner could be adversely affected by many factors, including:\n• Third-party manufacturing capacity may not be available when we need it, particularly from our foundry partners from whom we procure\nsilicon wafers.\n• Efforts to diversify our supplier base may be unsuccessful or may not result in us obtaining the anticipated benefits of such diversification.\n• Some products have long lead times, and we place orders for them many months before our anticipated delivery dates to our customers. If\nwe inaccurately forecast customer demand, then we may be unable to meet our customers’ delivery requirements or we may accumulate\nexcess inventory, increasing our costs.\n• Supply disruptions may affect our ability to meet partner or end-user demand, whether in a cost-effective manner or at all, potentially\ncausing those partners or end users to cancel orders, qualify alternative suppliers or purchase from our competitors. Supply disruptions\ncan also distort demand, making it even harder to meet true demand.\nIf our suppliers fail to manufacture our products at reasonable prices or with satisfactory quality levels, then our ability to bring those products to market\nand our reputation could both suffer. If supplier capacity diminishes, whether from equipment failures, closures, bankruptcy, capacity allocation, in response to\npublic health events (such as Covid-19), catastrophic loss of facilities or otherwise, then we could have difficulty fulfilling orders, our revenue could decline\nand our growth prospects could be impaired. Transitioning our product manufacturing to new providers would take many months and, in the case of ICs, could\ntake years. Any\n35\nTable of Contents\ntransition would require a requalification by our customers or end users, which could also adversely affect our ability to sell our products as well as our\noperating results.\nShortages of silicon wafers, integrated-circuit (IC) post-processing capacity or components used in our readers and gateways may adversely affect\nour ability to meet demand for our products and adversely affect our revenue and/or gross margins.\nWafer shortfalls limit sales and may cause market-share losses. We expect wafer capacity in at least some of the semiconductor nodes we use to be tight\nfor the foreseeable future. We procure wafers on a purchase-order basis, so our wafer supply is not guaranteed, and we may not receive adequate supply from\nour foundry partners when shortages occur.\nWafer shortages may also artificially increase bookings as customers over-order our products, and then cause sales declines as those customers consume\ntheir accumulated inventory. Additionally, if our suppliers charge us more but we are unable to raise our prices to cover those higher costs, our gross margins\nand other financial results could suffer.\nShortages of our silicon products can also occur due to post-processing constraints. To convert the wafers we receive from our foundry partner into\nsaleable ICs, we perform additional steps including testing, thinning, bumping and dicing. If our third-party suppliers are unable to efficiently perform these\nsteps, and our production capacity is constrained as a result, we may be unable to satisfy demand for our products and our financial results could suffer.\nWe have also experienced shortages and price increases for components we use in our readers and gateways, as well as in packaging and test capacity for\nour reader ICs, and we may continue to experience such shortages and price increases in the future. Any such shortages or price increases will negatively impact\nour product availability and costs and our financial results will suffer.\nWe bear inventory risks because our products have relatively long lead times, demand for our products are hard to accurately forecast, and we rely\non partners to sell and distribute our products.\nWe maintain inventory to meet customer demand. To guard against wafer shortages, and to allow for production risks given the relatively long lead times\nfor our many of our products, we may invest in inventory to support anticipated business growth, like we did with endpoint IC inventory in 2017, 2020 and late\n2022/early 2023. When we introduce new products, we may also initially carry higher inventory or have slower inventory turns depending on market\nacceptance.\nWe typically order products from our suppliers based on partner forecasts before we receive purchase orders. However, many of our partners have\ndifficulty accurately forecasting their demand and the timing of that demand, and sometimes cancel orders or reschedule product shipments, in some cases with\nlittle or no advance notice to us. Partners will also sometimes give us soft commitments for large orders that do not materialize. We have additional uncertainty\narising from competition and from unanticipated external events, such as macroeconomic trends or events and changes in regulatory standards, all of which can\nadversely affect demand and consequently our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\nHigh inventory levels can increase expenses or reserves and expose us to a higher risk of product obsolescence, especially when we introduce new\nproducts and technologies. If we are unable to sell the inventory we purchased, or if we must sell it at lower prices, then our business will be negatively\nimpacted.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences.\nWe regularly evaluate potential strategic transactions, and we may pursue them if complementary to our business. For example, in April 2023 we\ncompleted our acquisition of Voyantic Oy, a global provider of RFID (primarily RAIN and NFC) inlay and label design, manufacturing and test systems.\nStrategic transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We have limited experience executing acquisitions. Integrating an\nacquired company, business or technology may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Acquisition-related risks include:\n• difficulties integrating acquired products or lines of business into our strategy and product plans;\n• customers switching from us to new suppliers because of the acquisition;\n• inability to retain employees from the business we acquire;\n• challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n• difficulties integrating accounting, management information, human resource, legal and other administrative systems to permit effective\nmanagement of the business we acquire;\n• potential requirements for remediating controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in the acquired business that, prior to\nthe acquisition, lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n36\nTable of Contents\n• potential liability for past or present environmental, hazardous substance or contamination concerns associated with the acquired business or its\npredecessors;\n• possible write-offs or impairment charges resulting from the acquisition; and\n• unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the acquired business.\nForeign acquisitions involve additional risks beyond those above, including those related to integrating operations across different cultures and\nlanguages, currency risks and the economic, political and regulatory risks associated with other countries. Also, the anticipated benefit of any acquisition,\ndomestic or foreign, may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, debt\nincurrence, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or goodwill write-offs, any of which could harm our financial condition. Future acquisitions may\nrequire us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nChanges in global trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the jurisdictions where we\ncurrently develop and sell products, and any negative consequences resulting from such changes, could materially affect our business.\nThe U.S. government has imposed significant tariffs on a variety of items imported from other countries, particularly China. China responded by\nimposing significant tariffs on a variety of items imported from the United States. These tariffs could materially and adversely affect our ability to compete\ninternationally. Although the United States and China signed a preliminary trade agreement in early 2020, the tariffs remain in place as negotiations between the\ncountries continue. The future of these tariffs, as well as the possibility for new tariffs, remains uncertain. Changes in U.S. and Chinese industrial policy also\ncontribute to uncertainty regarding the global trade environment.\nOther causes of uncertainty include the effects of sanctions and other actions against Russia after Russia invaded Ukraine. While we do not today have\nbusiness with Russian partners or end users, the effect of these sanctions on global trade and macroeconomic conditions generally—such as increasing energy\ncosts and inflation—could nevertheless negatively affect our business.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in operating abroad and may not be able to successfully maintain or expand our international operations.\nIn 2023, we derived 72% of our total revenue from sales outside the United States. We anticipate growing our business, in part, by growing our\ninternational operations, which presents a variety of risks, including:\n• changes, some unexpected or unanticipated, in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other\ntrade restrictions;\n• lack of established, clear or fairly implemented standards or regulations with which our products must comply;\n• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, judgments and arbitration awards in international courts, and in collecting accounts receivable as\nwell as longer payment and collection periods;\n• limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection;\n• misappropriation of our intellectual property;\n• inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates;\n• restrictions, or changes thereof, on foreign trade or investment, including currency-exchange controls, including as a result of sanctions\nagainst Russia;\n• changes in a country’s or region’s political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions, including, for example, global and regional\neconomic disruptions caused by any future public health outbreaks or pandemics, including a resurgence of Covid-19;\n• political, social and economic instability abroad; wars and other armed conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip; geopolitical\ntensions, such as those between the United States, China and Taiwan; and terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n• differing regulations with regard to maintaining operations, products and public information;\n• inequities or difficulties obtaining or maintaining export and import licenses;\n37\nTable of Contents\n• differing labor regulations, including where labor laws may be more advantageous to employees than in the United States;\n• restrictions on earnings repatriation;\n• corrupt or unethical practices in foreign jurisdictions that may subject us to exposure under applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery\nlaws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010; and\n• regulations, and changes thereof, relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and\npersonal information, particularly in Europe.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nWe must export and import our products in compliance with U.S. export controls, including the Commerce Department’s Export Administration\nRegulations and economic and trade sanctions established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, as well as similar controls\nestablished in the countries in which we do business. For example, the U.S. Commerce Department recently strengthened rules regarding semiconductor- and\nsupercomputer-related products and restrictions against sending certain chips and chip-related technology and software to China without an export license. The\nmodifications included an expansion of the products and destinations that require licensing. In addition, the United States and other countries continue to\nexpand the economic sanctions and export control restrictions imposed against Russia and Belarus and certain Russian nationals and entities after Russia\ninvaded Ukraine. We must undertake additional diligence efforts to comply with these rules, which may be time-consuming and result in delayed or lost\nopportunities. We may not always be successful in obtaining necessary export or import licenses, and our failure to obtain required export or import approval\nfor our products or limitations on our ability to export or sell our products may harm our domestic and international sales and negatively affect our revenue.\nTariffs could also have a material impact on our product costs and decrease our ability to sell our products to existing or potential customers as well as\nharm our ability to compete internationally. For more information, see “Changes in global trade policies could have a material adverse effect on us.” Any\nchanges in our product or in export or import regulations or legislation; shifts or changes in enforcement; or changes in the countries, persons or technologies\ntargeted by these regulations could delay us introducing new products in international markets, decrease use of our products by, or decrease our ability to export\nor sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations, adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nInstability or deterioration in the political, social, business or economic conditions in key jurisdictions could harm our supply or development of\nproducts.\nDeterioration in the political, social, business or economic conditions in any jurisdictions in which we have significant suppliers, distributors or end\nusers—including as a result of natural disasters, labor strikes, public health crises, geopolitical events or other developments—could slow or halt product\nshipments or disrupt our ability to manufacture, test or post-process our products., as well as our ability to effectively and timely execute on end user\ndeployments. We outsource our manufacturing and production to suppliers in a small number of Asian jurisdictions, including Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and\nChina. Some of these jurisdictions experienced significant restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. These jurisdictions have also experienced significant\nchanges in political, social, business or economic conditions in the past and may experience them in the future.\nWe could be forced to transfer our manufacturing, testing and post-processing activities to more stable, and potentially more costly, regions or find\nalternative suppliers.\nWe source a significant portion of our wafers from suppliers in Taiwan, and our supply of wafers and other critical components may be materially and\nadversely affected by diplomatic, geopolitical and other developments between China and Taiwan. Notably, China has refused to renounce the use of military\nforce against Taiwan, and there can be no assurance that relations between China and Taiwan will not deteriorate further, particularly in light of ongoing\ntensions between the United States and China. Any such developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur business operations could be adversely affected by public health outbreaks and pandemics, or by natural disasters.\nStarting in 2020, Covid-19 created significant worldwide economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption, and presented our business with several risks\nand challenges. Although the Covid-19 global health emergency officially ended in 2023, experts caution that Covid-19 remains a public health risk, and the\nextent to which any public health outbreak or pandemic could impact future market demand and our business results is uncertain.\nIn addition, other disasters, whether natural or manmade, could decrease demand for our products, disable our facilities, disrupt operations or cause\ncatastrophic losses. We have facilities in areas with known seismic activity, such as our headquarters in Seattle, Washington. We have facilities in areas with\nknown flooding, such as our office in Shanghai, China. We have a wafer post-processing\n38\nTable of Contents\nsubcontractor in Thailand, a region with a known, and recent, history of flooding. A loss at any of these or other of our or our suppliers’ facilities could disrupt\noperations, delay production and shipments, reduce revenue and engender potentially large expenses. We do not carry insurance covering potential losses\ncaused by pandemics, earthquakes, floods or other disasters.\nRisks Relating to Our Relationships with Partners and End Users\nWe rely on a small number of customers for a large share of our revenue.\nWe sell our endpoint ICs directly to inlay and tag OEMs and ODMs. We sell our reader ICs to OEMs and ODMs and our readers and gateways to\nsolution providers, VARs and SIs, all primarily through distribution. If we fail to retain our endpoint IC, reader IC, reader or gateway partners or distributors or\nfail to establish relationships with new partners, then our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed.\nIn 2023, sales to tag OEMs Avery Dennison and Arizon accounted for 33% and 11% of our total revenue, respectively. Sales concentration to a small\nnumber of OEMs decreases our bargaining power and increases the risk that our pricing or sales could decline based on actions taken by our competitors or our\nown failure to compete effectively.\nOur competitors’ relationships with, or acquisitions of, these partners or distributors could interfere with our relationships with them. Any such\ninterference could impair or delay our product sales or increase our cost of sales.\nWe engage directly with some end users. Their projects, often involving large purchases of our readers and gateways, are often discrete deployments that\ncan result in significant sales for periods of time. They also increase the volatility of our revenue and operating results. If we are unable to replace project-based\nrevenue with new revenue streams, or if end users with large projects change or delay those projects without providing us with adequate notice, then our sales\ncould decline from period to period and harm our stock price.\nOur ability to affect or determine end-user demand is limited in part because we sell and fulfill primarily through partners and rarely directly to end\nusers.\nEnd users drive demand for our products but because we sell our products primarily through partners, we are one step removed from those end users and\nare often unable to directly assess and affect their demand. Our partners may choose to prioritize selling our competitors’ products over ours, or they may offer\nproducts that compete with our products or limit sales of our products. If our partners do not sell enough of our products or if they choose to decrease their\ninventories of our products, then our sales to those partners and our revenue will decline.\nOur partners may not properly forecast end users’ demand for our products.\nOur reserve estimates for products stocked by our distributors are based primarily on reports provided to us by those distributors, typically monthly. If\nthe inventory and resale information our partners and distributors provide is inaccurate, or if we do not receive it in a timely manner, then we may not have a\nreliable view of products being sold to end users which could negatively impact our operating results. If our partners overestimate demand, they may invest in\nbuilding too much capacity, which would put pricing pressure on the RAIN industry. In the short term, our partners might purchase more of our products than\nthey need, increasing their inventory and reducing our future sales to them, and distributors may, subject to time and quality limitations, seek to return products\nin exchange for other products. If our partners underestimate demand, we may not be able to satisfy their needs and that of their customers, and adoption might\nsuffer. In either case, our business and operating results could be negatively affected.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on the success of strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance and alignment.\nWe invest in relationships with solution providers, SIs, VARs and software providers whose product and/or solution offerings complement ours and\nthrough which we often fulfill our product sales. Our business will be harmed if we fail to develop and grow these partner relationships. For example, our\noperating results may suffer if our efforts developing partner relationships increase our costs but do not increase revenue. Partner relationships may also include\nexclusivity provisions, multiple levels of distribution, discounted pricing or investments in other companies. The cost of developing and maintaining these\npartner relationships may go unrecovered and our efforts may not generate a corresponding revenue increase.\nOccasionally we also engage directly with end users, often at their request, to help them develop solutions for challenging use cases. Such direct\nengagements could cause, or could be perceived to cause, conflicts with partners that could harm our partner relationships and our business, results of\noperations or financial condition.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to maintain or enhance our brand recognition or reputation on which our business depends, then our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that building our brand and reputation is key to our relationships with partners and end users and our ability to attract new partners and end\nusers. We also believe that our brand and reputation will be increasingly important as market competition increases. Our success depends on a range of factors,\nincluding:\n• continuing to deliver high-quality, innovative and defect-free products;\n• maintaining high partner and end-user satisfaction;\n• successfully differentiating our products from those of our competitors; and\n• managing both positive and negative publicity.\nProduct supply shortages have challenged our ability to meet market needs and we have increased prices in response to our suppliers increasing their\nprices to us. Our inability to supply partners and end users with products they need, and/or our need to increase our prices could result in long-lasting, negative\nconsequences to our relationships with those partners and end users, to RAIN adoption and to our business overall.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance and regulatory matters may cause us to incur additional costs or expose us to\nadditional risks.\nInvestors, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, partners and end users are increasingly focusing on environmental, social and governance,\nor ESG, practices. Our ESG practices may not meet their standards, and they as well as advocacy groups may campaign for us to change our business or\npractices to address their ESG-related concerns. Our failure, or perceived failure, to adequately respond to any such campaigns could harm our business and\nreputation and negatively impact the market price of our securities. Moreover, with the continued evolution of ESG practices and reporting and disclosure\nrequirements, our costs related to those ESG practices and reporting and disclosure requirements could increase, which could negatively affect our operating\nresults. For example, the SEC has adopted final rules regarding climate-related disclosures in public companies’ periodic reporting, and compliance with these\nrules—including the implementation of necessary internal controls and reporting procedures—may lead to increased expenses and additional demands on our\nmanagement and board of directors.\nWe are subject to disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and\nadjoining countries in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements could affect the sourcing and\navailability of minerals that are used in the manufacture of our products. We have to date incurred costs and expect to incur significant additional costs\nassociated with complying with the disclosure requirements, including for example, due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our\nproducts, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.\nAdditionally, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all minerals\nused in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement. We may also face challenges with government regulators and our customers and\nsuppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property, then our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual\nproperty rights and prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or circumventing those rights. We have historically focused on filing U.S. patent\napplications, for many reasons, including the fact that a significant portion of RAIN products are sold for use in the United States. We have only a small number\nof foreign patents and applications. We also only have registered trademarks and domain names in select countries where we believe filing for such protection is\nappropriate. By focusing our intellectual property protection on the United States and a small number of foreign countries, we have a limited ability to assert\nintellectual property rights outside the United States, including in some significant foreign markets such as China or Europe. Moreover, the global\nmanufacturing and distribution systems for tags or labels incorporating our endpoint IC products could complicate our efforts to enforce our U.S. patents.\nAs we increasingly work with third parties, possibly including parties that compete with us to an extent, to advance our technical innovations and\nfeatures, we cannot guarantee that our efforts to protect our intellectual property will be completely effective.\nWe cannot guarantee that:\n• any of the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights we presently employ in our business will not\nlapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n40\nTable of Contents\n• our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\n• our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited\nby our agreements with third parties;\n• any of our pending or future patent applications will issue or have the coverage we originally sought;\n• our intellectual property rights can or will be enforced, particularly in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal\nprotections may be weak;\n• we will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against, or to license our technology to, others and collect royalties or\nother payments; or\n• we will retain the right to ask for a royalty-bearing license to an industry standard if we fail to file an intellectual property declaration\npursuant to the standards process.\nMonitoring and addressing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights is\ntime consuming, distracting, expensive and uncertain. Our failure to identify unauthorized use of, or otherwise adequately protect our intellectual property could\nadversely affect our business.\nWe have been and may in the future be party to intellectual property disputes which could be time consuming and costly to prosecute, defend or\nsettle, result in the loss of significant rights, and adversely affect RAIN adoption or adoption of our products or platform.\nPatent litigation is complex and uncertain. We may or may not prevail in patent-related proceedings and such proceedings may result in increased legal\nexpenses, additional demands on our management’s time and attention, and negative effects on our relationships with partners or end users. If any pending or\nfuture proceedings result in an adverse outcome, our intellectual property rights could be weakened and we could be required to:\n• cease manufacturing, using or selling the infringing products, processes or technology;\n• pay substantial damages for infringement;\n• expend significant resources to develop noninfringing products, processes or technology;\n• license technology from the party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n• cross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor;\nor\n• pay substantial damages to our partners or end users for them to discontinue using, or replace, infringing products with noninfringing products.\nEven if we do prevail in patent-related proceedings, verdicts and judgments can be modified or even reversed by trial or appellate courts. License\nagreements entered in settlement of patent litigation, particularly any entered into with our competition, may not be as effective over the long term in providing\nus with all the benefits we bargained for when we entered into them.\nMany companies in our industry, as well as nonpracticing entities, hold patents and other intellectual property rights and may pursue, protect and enforce\nthose intellectual property rights. We receive invitations to license patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that could be important to our\nbusiness. We also receive assertions against us, our partners and end users claiming we or they infringe patent or other intellectual property rights. If we decline\nto accept an invitation to license or to refute an asserted claim, then the offering or claiming party may pursue litigation against us.\nIntellectual property disputes have adversely affected RAIN adoption in the past and could disrupt growth prospects in the future. In 2011, Round Rock\nResearch filed lawsuits against 11 end users, including Walmart and Macy’s, for RAIN-related patent infringement. Despite the subsequent availability of an\nindustry-wide license, we believe those lawsuits adversely affected demand for our products from 2011 to 2019. Subsequent litigation, including our patent\nlitigation against NXP between 2019 and early 2024, may not have had as pronounced effects on demand as the Round Rock litigation, but could have\ndampened RAIN growth particularly in categories beyond those where RAIN is already established such as retail apparel. We, our partners, suppliers or end\nusers could continue to be involved in intellectual property disputes in the future which could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nMany of our agreements require us to indemnify and defend partners and end users from third-party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of\nadverse rulings. These damages could be sizable and disproportionate to the business we derive from those partners or end users. Moreover, we may not know\nwhether we are infringing a third party’s intellectual property rights due to the\n41\nTable of Contents\nlarge number of RAIN-related patents or other systemic factors. For example, patent applications in the United States are maintained in confidence for up to 18\nmonths after filing or, in some instances, for the entire time prior to patent issuance. Consequently, we may not be able to account for such rights until after a\npatent issues.\nIntellectual property policies of industry standards organizations in whose working groups we participate could require us to provide royalty-free\nlicenses of some to our intellectual property.\nWhen participating in GS1, ISO, RAIN and other industry-standards organizations, it is a general policy that those who participate in developing a\nprotocol or standard must license, either royalty-free or under reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or RAND, terms, intellectual property that is necessary to\nimplement all or part of the protocol or standard. The standards body may require that the license be granted to members, as in the case of GS1, or to all parties,\nas in the case of ISO, that implement the protocol or standard.\nAs a participant in developing GS1 EPCglobal UHF Gen2, UHF Gen2 V2, UHF Gen2 V3, tag data standards, low-level reader protocol and other GS1\nEPCglobal protocols, we agreed to license to other GS1 EPCglobal members, on a royalty-free basis, those of our patents necessary to practice those protocols,\nsubject to us receiving reciprocal royalty-free rights from the other GS1 EPCglobal member practicing the protocol. As a participant in developing ISO\nstandards, we agreed to license on a RAND basis those of our patents necessary to practice those standards, subject to us receiving a reciprocal RAND license\nfrom the other entity practicing the standard.\nAlthough the policies themselves seek to advance protocol or standards development, disputes can arise because it may not be clear whether certain\nintellectual property is necessary to practice a protocol or standard. Such uncertainty could complicate us asserting our not-necessary patents against others, or\nto use those patents in our own defense, thereby devaluing our intellectual property. Further, some GS1 EPCglobal members declined to license their\nintellectual property on royalty-free terms, instead retaining the right to license their technology on RAND terms. These members may choose to assert their\nintellectual property, in which case we will need to defend ourselves within the confines of the GS1 and ISO intellectual property policies.\nWe rely on third-party license agreements which, if impaired or terminated, could cause production or shipment delays that could harm our\nbusiness.\nWe have license agreements with third parties for patents, software and technology we use in our operations and in our products. For example, we\nlicense tools from design-automation software vendors to design our silicon ICs. Third-party licenses for patents, software and other technology important to\nour business may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or may not be available at all. Loss of any such licenses could cause\nmanufacturing interruptions or delays or reductions in product shipments until we can develop, license, integrate and deploy alternative technologies which, if\neven possible, could harm our business and operating results.\nOur use of open-source software may expose us to additional risks and weaken our intellectual property rights.\nOur products, processes and technology sometimes use or incorporate software that is subject to an open-source license. Certain open-source licenses\nrequire a user who intends to distribute the open-source software as a component of the user’s software to disclose publicly part or all of the user’s source code.\nIn addition, certain open-source software licenses require the user of such software to make derivative works of the open-source software available to others at\nlow or no cost. Open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of their\ncode, opening us to business risks that could materially harm our operating results.\nWe cannot guarantee that we have incorporated open-source software in a manner that is consistent with our policies and procedures relative to such\nopen-source software, or in a manner that will not subject us to liability.\nRisks Relating to Privacy and Cybersecurity\nPrivacy and security concerns relating to RAIN could damage our reputation and deter current or potential customers from using our products.\nPrivacy advocates and others have raised and may continue raising concerns about RAIN compromising consumer privacy or facilitating theft. These\nconcerns include unauthorized parties potentially collecting personal information or personal data, tracking consumers, stealing identities or causing other\nissues relating to privacy or data protection. Any such incident could cause our or our partners’ or end users’ operations to be disrupted and subject us or them to\nregulatory investigations or proceedings and claims, demands or litigation; consequently, we could face potential liability and significant costs and expenses to\nremediate or otherwise respond to the incident. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with any privacy- or security-related laws, regulations or contractual\nor other obligations to which we are or may be subject may result in regulatory actions, claims or litigation; legal and other costs; substantial time and\nresources; and fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any actions or concerns about security and privacy may be expensive to defend, cause us to expend\nsubstantial time and resources and damage our reputation and operating results or negatively impact overall RAIN industry development, even if unfounded.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe cannot be sure that any limitation-of-liability provisions in our agreements with customers, contracts with third-party vendors and service providers\nor other contracts are enforceable or adequate or will protect us from any liabilities or damages against claims relating to a security breach or other privacy- or\nsecurity-related issue.\nGovernment regulations and guidelines and other standards relating to consumer privacy and cybersecurity may adversely impact adoption of our\nproducts, require us to make design changes or constrain our ability to implement new and desired product features, and actual or alleged violations of\nlaws relating to privacy or cyber security may result in claims, proceedings and liability.\nOur partners and end users are subject to laws and regulations related to collecting, storing, transmitting and using personal information and personal\ndata, as well as to additional laws and regulations that address privacy and cybersecurity related to RFID in general. Because RAIN is a type of RFID, we\nbelieve these laws and regulations apply to RAIN.\nThe European Commission, or the EC, has issued guidance to address privacy concerns about RFID. In May 2009, the EC issued a recommendation that\nretailers in the EU inform their customers when RFID tags are either on or embedded within products. In April 2011, the EC signed a voluntary agreement with\nprivate and public entities to develop privacy guidelines for companies using RFID in the EU. Whereas compliance is voluntary, our partners and end users that\ndo business in the EU prefer products that comply with the guidelines. If our products do not comply or enable compliance with the guidelines, then our\nbusiness may suffer.\nMore generally, the data security and privacy legislative and regulatory landscape in the United States, EU and other jurisdictions continues evolving.\nAspects of key privacy laws and regulations—including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act, similar privacy laws\nenacted in other states and the EU General Data Protection Regulation—remain unclear as of the date of this report and continue evolving, potentially with far-\nreaching implications. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and security; related industry standards and guidelines; and continued evolution\nof these laws, regulations, standards, guidelines and other actual and asserted obligations, as well as their interpretation and enforcement, may require us to\nmodify our products, practices and policies, which we may not be able to do on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and otherwise could cause us to incur\nsubstantial costs and expenses. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with which we do business to comply with these laws and regulations\nor other actual or asserted obligations may result in claims or litigation; actions against us by governmental entities; legal and other costs; substantial time and\nresources and fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any such actions may be expensive to defend, may incur substantial legal and other costs and substantial time\nand resources and likely would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we fail to develop products that meet end-user privacy requirements, then end users may choose not to use our products.\nAlthough the Gen2 V3 protocol includes features for addressing consumer privacy and authenticating a tag, and although we have incorporated custom\nfeatures in our products designed to further protect consumer privacy, a third party may still breach these features, including as implemented in our products, in\nwhich case our reputation could be damaged and our business and prospects could suffer.\nA breach of security or other security incident impacting our systems or others used in our business could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe face risks of security breaches and incidents from a variety of sources including viruses, ransomware, hacking, malicious code, supply-chain attacks\nas well as social engineering or other employee or contractor negligence, malfeasance or unintentional acts. Accidental or willful security breaches or incidents,\nor unauthorized access to our facilities or information systems, or to others used in our business, could compromise the security of those facilities or\ninformation systems and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of confidential, personal or proprietary information. These risks may be heightened in\nconnection with geopolitical tensions and events.\nThe consequences of loss, unavailability, misuse, corruption or other unauthorized processing of confidential, personal or proprietary information could\ninclude, among other things, unfavorable publicity, reputational damage, difficulty marketing or selling our products, customer allegations of breach of contract,\nloss or theft of intellectual property, claims and litigation, governmental and regulatory investigations and other proceedings and fines, penalties and other\ndamages and liabilities. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation and business\nrelationships.\nWe rely on third-party services to store and process data on our behalf, and on third-party security systems in a variety of applications. Our platform\noperates in conjunction with, and depends on, third-party products, services and components for security. The cybersecurity threat environment continues\nevolving, especially with heightened activity by state-sponsored actors. If we, our platform, or any of the third parties on which we rely suffers or is believed to\nhave suffered a security breach or incident, vulnerability, error, ransomware or malicious event, then we could face increased costs, claims, liability, reduced\nrevenue and harm to our reputation.\n43\nTable of Contents\nWe devote resources to detect and prevent security breaches and other security-related incidents. In the event of an actual or perceived security breach or\nincident we may need to expend significant resources to mitigate, notify third parties of, and otherwise address the breach or incident, its root cause and take\nsteps to prevent further breaches or incidents. Our insurance may not adequately cover claims relating to an actual or perceived security breach or incident and\nany breach or incident may increase our insurance costs as well as reduce or eliminate the future availability of such insurance, harming our business and\nreputation.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have a history of losses and have only achieved profitability periodically. We cannot be certain that we will attain or sustain profitability in the\nfuture.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception in 2000, with a net loss of $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and an accumulated deficit\nof $430.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Although we reported GAAP net income for the first three quarters of 2024, there can be no assurance that we will\nbe able to sustain profitability in the future. Our ability to attain or sustain profitability depends on numerous factors, many of which are out of our control,\nincluding continued RAIN industry adoption and us maintaining or growing our market share. Our costs to support operations, product development and\nbusiness and personnel expansion in sales, engineering and marketing are significant and are likely to increase as we invest to grow the market and our share of\nit, reduce our costs and improve our operations. If we fail to increase our revenue or manage our expenses, or if our investments in growing the market or our\nshare of it fail, then we may not attain or sustain profitability.\nWe have a history of significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results.\nOur history shows significant sales volatility and a limited ability to forecast sales. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, our visibility to future\nsales, including volumes and prices, will continue to be limited. That limited visibility may cause fluctuations in our operating results and differences between\nactual and expected quarterly or annual operating results.\nMany factors, some outside our control, may cause or contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results. These fluctuations make\nfinancial planning and forecasting difficult. These fluctuations may also cause unanticipated decreases in our available cash, which could negatively affect our\nbusiness and prospects. Material factors that contribute to fluctuations in our operating results include:\n• macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, recession or economic slowdown, and their impact on our business and that of our\nsuppliers, partners and end users;\n• fluctuations or delays in RAIN adoption and deployment by end users;\n• changes in the pace or direction of major deployments, whether due to macroeconomic conditions or enterprise-specific events or\ncircumstances, and our, or our partners', ability to win business from these deployments;\n• fluctuations in demand for our products or platform, including by tag OEMs and other significant partners and end users on whom we rely\nfor a substantial portion of our revenue;\n• fluctuations in the pricing and availability or supply of our products or key elements or components of those products, especially\nsemiconductor wafers;\n• degradations in product quality, whether due to us or our suppliers, including quality claims or product returns;\n• delays in new-product introductions and in the maturity of our new-product technologies;\n• decreases in selling prices for our products;\n• delays in our product-shipment timing, customer or end-user sales or deployment cycles, or work performed under development contracts;\n• intellectual property disputes involving us, our partners, end users or other participants in our industry, or the timing of license payments\nfor our intellectual property;\n• adverse outcomes of litigation or governmental proceedings;\n• timing variability in product introductions, enhancements, services and technologies by us and our competitors as well as market\nacceptance of new or enhanced products, services and technologies;\n• unanticipated excess or obsolete inventory as a result of significant demand fluctuations, supply-chain mismanagement, new-product\nintroduction, quality issues or otherwise;\n• changes in the amount and timing of our operating costs, including those related to expanding our business, operations and infrastructure;\n44\nTable of Contents\n• changes in business cycles or seasonal fluctuations that affect the markets in which we sell;\n• changes in industry standards or specifications, or changes in government regulations, relating to our products or our platform;\n• late, delayed or cancelled payments from our partners or end users; and\n• unanticipated impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill.\nA substantial portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term, and as a result, fluctuations in revenue or unanticipated expenses can have a\nmaterial and immediate impact on our profitability and negatively affect our operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nIn the future, we may need to raise additional capital, including pursuant to shelf registration statements we may file from time to time with the SEC,\npotentially diluting our stockholders, restricting our operations or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\nDebt financing, if available, may include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, expending\ncapital or declaring dividends, or may impose financial covenants that limit our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nOur management has broad discretion in how to invest and spend our cash and cash equivalents and the proceeds from financings, including on capital\nexpenditures, product development, working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may spend our cash and cash equivalents in ways that our\nstockholders may not agree with or that do not yield favorable returns.\nIf we need additional capital but cannot raise it on acceptable terms, if at all, then we may not be able to meet our business objectives, financial\nobligations or both. If we raise additional capital but do not deploy it effectively then our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could\nbe harmed and the market price of our common stock could suffer.\nRisks Relating to U.S. Federal Income Tax\nOur ability to use net operating losses and research and development credits to offset future taxable income and income taxes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had federal U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $230.5 million and U.S. federal research and development\ncredit carryforwards of $30.5 million, which we may use to reduce future taxable income or income taxes. We have established a valuation allowance against\nthe carrying value of these deferred tax assets. The U.S. federal NOLs and U.S. federal research and development credit carryforwards began expiring in 2020.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, a corporation that experiences a more-than 50% ownership change by one\nor more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a company's stock over a three-year testing period is limited in its ability to use its pre-\nchange NOLs and other tax assets to offset future taxable income or income taxes. If we undergo a future ownership change then our ability to use our NOLs\nand credit carryforwards could be limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Our NOLs may also be limited under state law. As a result of these limitations,\nwe may not be able to utilize a material portion of, or possibly any of, our NOLs and/or credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income or income taxes.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. During the ordinary course of business, we use significant judgment\nin evaluating our worldwide income tax obligations and we conduct many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we\nbelieve our tax determinations are proper, the final determination of any tax audits and any possible litigation could be materially different from our historical\nincome tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or\nperiods for which that determination is made.\nChanges in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations and policies of several taxing jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, as well as other factors, could cause us to\nexperience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect our tax positions and results of our operations. For example,\nin August 2022, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the United States enacted a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks and a 15% alternative minimum tax\non adjusted financial statement income. Additionally, beginning in 2022, the Code eliminated the right to deduct research and development expenditures and\ninstead requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize U.S. and foreign research and development expenditures over five and 15 tax years, respectively. We have\naccounted for\n45\nTable of Contents\nthese changes in accordance with our understanding of the guidance available as of the date of this filing and as described in more detail in our financial\nstatements.\nThe CHIPS and Science Act, enacted August 9, 2022, provides tax credits for semiconductor manufacturing activities within the United States, but\nbecause we outsource our semiconductor manufacturing we do not expect to be entitled to these tax credits.\nMany countries, as well as organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, have implemented or proposed changes\nto existing tax laws, including a 15% global minimum tax. Any of these developments or changes in U.S. federal, state or international tax laws or tax rulings\ncould adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rates, tax payments or tax credits and\nincentives will not be adversely affected by these or other developments or changes in law.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value-added or similar taxes.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value-added or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are either not\napplicable or an exemption from such taxes applies. Certain jurisdictions may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments,\npenalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future, including as a result of a change in law. Such tax assessments, penalties and\ninterest or future requirements may negatively affect our operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Reporting and Disclosure\nAny failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure and internal controls over financial reporting, or our ability to produce timely and accurate\nfinancial statements, could adversely affect investor confidence in us.\nAs a public company, we must maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal\ncontrols are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud.\nAny failure to implement and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, including identifying\nmaterial weaknesses, could cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports, which could adversely\naffect the market price of our common stock. We could also be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC and other regulatory\nauthorities.\nRisks Relating to Owning or Trading Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate substantially. The following factors, in addition to general\nrisks and other risks described in this report, may have a material effect on the trading price of our common stock:\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n• changes in operating performance, stock market valuations and volatility in the market prices of other technology companies generally,\nand of those in our industry in particular;\n• actual or anticipated quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n• delays in end-user deployments of RAIN solutions;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital\ncommitments;\n• supply interruptions, including semiconductor wafer or other product or component shortfalls;\n• developments relating to intellectual property rights or in disputes relating to those rights;\n• our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n• commencement of, or our involvement in, litigation;\n• changes in our board of directors or management;\n• changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n46\nTable of Contents\n• unstable political and economic conditions, including instability resulting from wars and other armed conflicts, such as those in Ukraine\nand the Gaza Strip, or geopolitical tensions, such as those between the U.S., China and Taiwan;\n• the trading volume of our stock;\n• actual or perceived security breaches or incidents;\n• limited public float;\n• any future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n• financial analysts dropping or reducing their coverage of us; changes in financial estimates by analysts who do cover us; or our failure to\nmeet analyst estimates or investor expectations;\n• fluctuations in the values of companies that investors perceive to be comparable to us;\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, as well as any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\nand\n• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth in the markets in which we operate.\nTechnology stocks like ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, often unrelated or disproportionate to the company’s underlying\noperating performance. Stock price volatility can cause stockholders to institute securities class-action litigation or stockholder derivative litigation, as occurred\nto us between 2018 and 2020. If any of our stockholders were to sue us, the defense and disposition of the lawsuit could be costly and divert the time and\nattention of our management, harm our operating results and negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nTransactions relating to the 2021 Notes may affect our stock’s value.\nIf the 2021 Notes are converted by holders, then we are entitled to deliver cash, stock or any combination of cash or stock, at our election. If we elect to\ndeliver stock, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and public market sales of stock issued upon a conversion could decrease our\nstock price. Anticipated future conversions of the 2021 Notes into stock could also decrease our stock price, as could short selling by holders of the 2021 Notes\nto hedge their positions.\nIn December 2019, we issued the 2019 Notes. When we did so, we entered into privately negotiated capped-call transactions with financial\ncounterparties to mitigate the dilutive impact on the Company above a given stock price. We left those capped-call transactions intact after we acquired the\nremainder of the outstanding 2019 Notes in June 2022. From time to time, the financial counterparties to the capped calls may modify their hedge positions by\nentering into or unwinding various derivative transactions involving our stock or by purchasing or selling our stock or other securities of ours in secondary\nmarket transactions prior to the maturity of the capped calls. This activity could cause a decrease in our stock price.\nFor more information on the 2019 Notes, the 2021 Notes and the capped-call transactions, see Note 7 of our condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this report.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exercise significant influence over matters\nsubject to stockholder approval.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially owned\napproximately 47.2% of our stock. As a result, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may be able to significantly influence, in their\ncapacity as stockholders, matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including electing directors and approving mergers, acquisitions or other transactions.\nThey may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This ownership\nconcentration could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain\ncontrol of us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. This ownership concentration could also prevent attempts by our\nstockholders to replace or remove our board of directors or management.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow or access to cash necessary to satisfy our obligations under the 2021 Notes, and our current and future\nindebtedness may restrict our business.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance any current or future indebtedness, including the 2021\nNotes, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the 2021 Notes or upon any fundamental change if holders require us to repurchase their\n2021 Notes for cash, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our\nbusiness may not generate sufficient future cash from operations to service our indebtedness and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to\ngenerate sufficient cash flow, then we may be required to pursue other alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring indebtedness or obtaining additional\nequity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the 2021 Notes, will depend on the\n47\nTable of Contents\ncapital markets and our financial condition at that time. We may not be able to pursue these alternatives on favorable terms or at all, which could result in us\ndefaulting on our debt obligations.\nOur existing and future indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders and significant effects on our business. For example, it\ncould:\n• make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including the 2021 Notes;\n• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the cash\navailable to run our business;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or in our industry;\n• restrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n• limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, executing\nour business strategy or for other purposes.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware or Washington law could prevent, delay or impede an acquisition of us and\nconstrain our stock price.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control\nor in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders\nmight otherwise deem to be in their best interests. These provisions could, therefore, adversely affect our stock price. Among other things, our certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws:\n• permit our board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may\ndesignate;\n• provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n• provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative\nvote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n• restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n• require that any action taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not by written\nconsent;\n• provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors\nat a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content\nof a stockholder’s notice;\n• do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in\nany uncontested election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose); and\n• provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chair of the board, our chief executive officer or the board of\ndirectors.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,\nwhich generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a\nperiod of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder. Likewise, because our principal executive offices are\nlocated in Washington, the anti-takeover provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act may apply to us under certain circumstances now or in the\nfuture. These provisions prohibit a “target corporation” from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any stockholder constituting an\n“acquiring person” for a period of five years following the date on which the stockholder became an “acquiring person.”\nOur bylaws include provisions that could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any\nderivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action\n48\nTable of Contents\nasserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a\nclaim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial\nforum favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and\nother employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action,\nwe may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nItem 2.
