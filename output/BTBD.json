The woodwork expert, 39, visited Rainbow Glass Studios in Stoke Newington, north east London, to learn about one of the UK’s oldest crafts – stained-glass window making – as new BT research shows two in three small businesses believe digital tools help preserve their heritage. The study comes as BT is working with businesses to move them away from the outdated analogue copper phone network onto moderndigital networks by the end of 2025, ahead of the UK’s planned analogue switch-off by the end of January 2027. Will was joined by Rainbow Glass’s husband-and-wife team Richard Paton and Eleanor Watson, who credit digital tech – including a booking website and social media – for giving the traditional business a new lease of life, allowing them to promote their art and popular classes UK-wide.

The call comes as four fifths (81%) of businesses started before 1900 say tech has helped to preserve their traditions.\n\nBT’s research reveals that three-quarters of small business leaders (77%) believe new technology has ensured their company’s survival. The majority – nine in ten (89%) – say digital tech has opened new revenue streams, 80% feel it has given them a competitive edge, while 79% say it has helped them connect with new customers.\n\nBT’s study shows that the UK’s small business community has been investing in technology this year, with most seizing the opportunity to boost their networks and digital tools in 2024. Four in five small firms (78%) say they have introduced new technology in the last 12 months. The top investment was a new website (50%), followed by increased cybersecurity (48%) and social media (45%). Two in five (40%) describe their small business as being a tech company, or one driven by advanced technology such as AI, robotics, or data analytics.\n\nHowever, a fifth of the UK’s small and medium firms (22%) – equivalent to more than a million1 – still think of themselves as an “analogue” company, using technologies like traditional landlines, paper-based contracts and physical filing systems to do business. For example, one in six (16%) still use fax machines.\n\nBT’s research comes as the UK is undergoing a once-in-a-generation tech upgrade, moving to digital networks as the ageing copper-based Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), approaches retirement after more than four decades in operation. The switchover from the PSTN to digital connectivity is a move to futureproof the UK’s infrastructure, with the old network more prone to faults and outages, putting businesses at risk of losing connection to critical services.\n\nBT is working with businesses of all sizes to support them in the move from analogue to digital, and is urging business customers to migrate over to more modern networks by the end of 2025. The PSTN is scheduled for retirement by the end of January 2027. As well as legacy copper landlines and broadband, other business equipment still connected to the PSTN will stop working as the network retires – including certain door entry systems, alarms and CCTV.\n\n**Kerry Small, Chief Operating Officer – Business at BT, comments:** _\"These figures show that the majority of the UK’s small businesses have been in upgrade mode this year – embracing the tech to help them thrive in a digital world. Today, businesses of all shapes and sizes can’t run without stable, secure connectivity. The UK’s analogue copper telephone network has a proud history, with its origins in the 1800s, but it’s no longer up to the task for businesses. It’s simply too risky to build the economy on a shaky foundation._\n\n_“Analogue companies making the move now can rely on rock-solid digital connectivity to help keep them in business for years to come. We’re supporting customers small and large through the move, so no business is left behind. Whether you’re a tech start-up or a family firm passed down through generations, when it comes to going digital – BT’s got your back.”_\n\n**Will Kirk, star of BBC’s** _**The Repair Shop,**_**comments:** “ _Restoring the crafts and artistry of the past is my job, so I know how important it is to preserve tradition for the next generations. Embracing digital tech can help small businesses with decades of history reach new customers, streamline services, and stay competitive. It doesn’t mean replacing the heart of what makes heritage businesses unique – it’s about giving them the tools they need to hold onto this heritage in an increasingly-digital world.”_\n\nBT is urging all businesses to switch on to the benefits of digital networks, including better stability, security and efficiency. For example, digital landlines enable businesses to make and receive calls from one number via multiple devices, even on the go. They also offer improved scam protection. Full-fibre broadband connectivity can deliver speeds that are up to ten times faster than copper-based connections to handle a wider range of multimedia services, such as video conferencing and streaming.\n\nFor more information on the switch from analogue to digital connectivity, businesses can visit: [business.bt.com/insights/uk-pstn-switch-off](https://business.bt.com/insights/uk-pstn-switch-off/).\n\n**Small business case study: Switching to digital**\n\nIn Birmingham, going digital has helped York Supplies hardware store to continue to deliver on its promise to be an extension of locals’ sheds – as it has since 1947 – even through tough times in retail.\n\nWhen the previous owner retired in 2022, residents and neighboring businesses rallied round to fundraise to ensure its survival, forming a co-operative that now owns the store. The buyout also led to a full technology makeover, enabling York Supplies to face the future with confidence. The business is now fully digital, equipped with fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) broadband, tablets and modern point-of-sale systems to help its staff streamline orders, expand product offerings, and liaise with customers online. Once a “hidden gem”, York Supplies now has about 2,000 social media followers and is planning to expand its product range.\n\n**Richard Bickle, Director of York Supplies Community Society, comments** : “Our business has been around since before fax machines, during which time it’s become a huge part of the local community, with generations of customers coming through our door.\n\n“When we purchased the shop we inherited a long-standing relationship with BT, but the infrastructure needed an upgrade so we could adopt new technologies to grow and market the business. Making the switch to digital has been so easy, with BT engineers explaining and installing everything for us. Our new system quietly supports the business as we venture into social media, and online ordering systems, all to help our heritage business to continue thriving in the 21st century.”\n\n**Notes to editors**\n\nBT worked with polling house, and BPC member, Censuswide, to survey 1,500 senior decision-makers working for UK-based small and medium-sized businesses between 28th October and 1st November 2024.\n\n1 UK parliament: Business Statistics show there were 5.5 million UK SMEs as of 1st January 2024. 22% of business leaders surveyed describe the business they work for as ‘analogue’; 0.22 x 5.5 = 1.21 million businesses.\n\nAbout BT Group\n\nBT Group is the UK’s leading provider of fixed and mobile telecommunications and related secure digital products, solutions and services.

Claire will become CEO of BT Consumer, on April 1.\n\n**Allison Kirkby said:** “Marc has been an outstanding leader of BT’s Consumer unit, contributing significantly to the company’s growth, and to multiple key initiatives such as leading the team through the integration of EE into BT Group, the creation of the BT Sport joint venture with Warner Bros Discovery, and launching New EE as our lead consumer brand.I am also grateful to Marc for his support to me this year, and for the support I know he’ll give to Claire as they work alongside each other over the next few months. As he moves on beyond BT in the Spring of next year, we all wish him every success.\n\n“I’m delighted to welcome Claire to BT. She brings a wealth of international telecoms experience and has a track record of driving growth in both consumer focused and retail businesses. She will be a brilliant addition to our team as we continue to grow BT’s Consumer division, and EE into the UK’s leading consumer brand for converged connectivity.”\n\n**Claire Gillies** said: “I am beyond excited to take this role at such an important British company. BT and EE are two of the UK’s most iconic brands leading the industry and connecting people to the things that really matter. I can’t wait to join Allison and the broader BT team as we pursue our mission to become the UK’s most trusted connector of people, devices and machines.”\n\n**Marc Allera** said: “I’m proud to have led an incredible team through enormous change in the market, and the evolution of the company for the past nine years. In that time we have transformed every aspect of our operations to deliver great service to our 25m customers across the UK, with everything they need for our fast-moving world of technology. We’ve created a fantastic platform for growth, and I wish Claire the very best for the future. While I’m looking forward to the next chapter, I’ll be leaving with great memories of my time at BT and EE, and want to thank every single one of my colleagues who has contributed to our success together.”\n\n**About Claire Gillies**\n\nClaire has more than 23 years’ experience in telecoms, having worked at Bell Canada since 2000 in a variety of senior leadership roles.

The expanded software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) service will help customers seamlessly transition from managed SD-WAN to secure access service edge (SASE), and forge ahead with their digital transformation by protecting access to their applications and data in the cloud.\n\nCustomers’ use of cloud technology is intensifying as they increasingly digitalise their businesses, shifting apps and data from their own private datacentres into public cloud services. At the same time, their organisations are more dispersed than ever, with people and devices accessing digital services from everywhere. \n\nBT’s existing managed SD-WAN service already provides customers with the flexibility to mix different connectivity options for each of their sites with a leading next-generation firewall. The company is now partnering with Fortinet to enhance this with new AI-powered SSE capabilities to provide a firewall-as-a-service, secure web gateway, cloud access security broker and zero-trust network access to provide a complete, managed SASE solution. This will enhance customers’ oversight of their networks backed with AI-powered proactive threat detection and data protection via BT’s unified monitoring services in the UK. It can also help customers create a zero-trust infrastructure by continuously interrogating the credentials of users and devices attempting to access the network either on the edge or out and about. \n\n“Our partnership with Fortinet is another signal to customers that BT has their back as they invest to become even more successful, creative, digital businesses,” said Matt Swinden, director, digital connectivity, BT. “Our new managed service enables them to provide consistent, seamless and secure experiences to their users of cloud-hosted digital services regardless of where they are accessing them from. This will help customers manage risk as they innovate with the latest connected technologies from IoT to AI.”\n\n“Building upon our decade-long partnership, we’re proud to collaborate on the new SASE service with BT to enable its UK customers to converge networking and security,” said Nirav Shah, Vice President, Products and Solutions, Fortinet. “SASE complements the cybersecurity platform approach to delivering integrated security and secure network access regardless of where users are located. By combining Fortinet’s cutting-edge SASE and secure networking solutions with a leading choice of fixed and 5G access networks from BT, customers can have a nimble, robust, and more secure network to help them get the best from the cloud.”\n\nAs part of the companies’ longstanding collaboration, BT has earned over 750 Fortinet accreditations, including _Regional Partner_ status as part of the Engage Partner Program and _UK Partner of the Year 2023_ ,whileFortinet achieved _Critical Partner_ status with BT Security. The managed service is powered by Fortinet Secure SD-WAN which was recently named a Leader in the [2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SD-WAN](https://global.fortinet.com/lp-en-ap-2024-gartner-mq-sdwan?utm_source=website&utm_medium=Press-Release&utm_campaign=UnifiedSASE-NAMER-US&utm_content=AR-gartner-mq-sdwan-G&utm_term=NewsRel&lsci=701Hr000002MO7ZIAW), marking the fifth consecutive year it has been recognized.\n\n**ENDS**\n\n**Notes to editors**\n\n[**SASE**](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/sase)\n\nSecure Access Service Edge (SASE) is a cloud architecture model that combines network and security-as-a-service functions together and delivers them as a single cloud service. Conceptually, SASE extends networking and security capabilities beyond where they’re typically available. This lets work-from-anywhere and remote workers, to take advantage of firewall as a service (FWaaS), secure web gateway (SWG), zero-trust network access (ZTNA), and a medley of threat detection functions. SASE is composed of Security Service Edge (SSE) and SD-WAN.\n\nThe term SASE (pronounced “sassy”) was first described by Gartner in an August 2019 report called, “The Future of Network Security in the Cloud.” Gartner notes that in the SASE market trend report, \"Customer demands for simplicity, scalability, flexibility, low latency, and pervasive security force convergence of the WAN edge and network security markets.”\n\n**The BT-managed Fortinet service leverages a number of solutions, including:**\n\n  * Fortinet Secure SD-WAN, which sends application traffic via a customer’s wide area network (WAN) links, using policies set by them to optimise user experience\n  * FortiSwitch, which provides local area network (LAN) ports for connecting additional wired devices such as desktop PC's, access points and point of sale machines.\n  * FortiAP Access Points, which extend Wi-Fi coverage in larger buildings simply with zero-touch deployment, and no licences to manage. Enjoy broad visibility, automated protection, and integrated threat intelligence.\n  * Mobile Data Access provides instant connectivity over 4G or 5G for rapid site set up and short-term needs, as well as a backup or active-active with a primary connection. All underpinned by EE; the UK’s leading mobile network.\n  * Fortinet Next-Generation Firewalls provide enterprise security at any edge, and at any scale on all WAN and LAN traffic as it passes through.\n  * FortiSASE, a cloud-delivered service that combines network and security functionalities, protecting users and devices when they are off a company's network by using common security policies and functionality similar to on-premises environments.\n\n\n\n**About the cyber security threat**\n\nCyber security breaches and attacks remain a common threat. According to its [latest figures](https://newsroom.bt.com/bt-spots-2000-signals-of-potential-cyber-attacks-every-second-as-tvs-hunted-star-warns-of-ai-arms-race/), BT detects over 2,000 signals of potential cyber-attacks every second — over 200 million per day. It also finds web-connected devices are scanned over 1,000 times a day by known malicious sources — an average of once every 90 seconds. While some scans are conducted legitimately for security monitoring, three in four (78 per cent) are not harmless — indicating that hackers are looking for weaknesses in the online systems of businesses and essential public services, as smart tech becomes common. BT’s data revealed a 1,234 per cent annual rise in new malicious internet protocol (IP) scanners recorded across its networks in the 12 months to July 2024. The increase reflects how cyber criminals are increasingly scanning for vulnerabilities through automated, ‘one time use’ disposable bots, in an attempt to evade existing blocking and security measures.\n\nBT’s analysis also showed that IT, defence and financial services are the three most targeted industries for cyber-attacks. \n\n _GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally.

Two of these were in areas which previously had no coverage on the footpath leading to the Steall Waterfall, while a further nine were on aspects of Ben Nevis where coverage has been significantly improved.\n\n**Ian Pooleman, Secretary and Medical Officer, LMRT** said: “Communications play a vital role in all of our rescue operations. We primarily use VHF radios to communicate with our base and other team members on the hill. We have had communication challenges in Glen Nevis and some aspects of Ben Nevis for many years, and the opportunity to locate a ‘repeater’ on this tower, with the support of BT Group, will make our operations safer and more efficient.”\n\n**David McKean, BT Group’s Tower Division Director** , said: “We’re delighted to be able to support Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team’s search and rescue efforts through the deployment of vital communications equipment on our tower at Glen Nevis. This is a simple yet effective example of how we can diversify the use of our portfolio of physical assets, many of which are in remote locations, to support the UK’s broader digital needs and connect more people for good, both now and into the future.”\n\nAbout BT Group\n\nBT Group is the UK’s leading provider of fixed and mobile telecommunications and related secure digital products, solutions and services.

We’ve ramped up our full fibre build and connections, seen further improvements in customer satisfaction, and our cost transformation contributed to growth in EBITDA and normalised free cash flow despite revenue declines driven by our non-UK operations and a competitive retail environment.“Our nationwide full fibre rollout has set new records, now reaching more than 16 million premises, and we have further extended our industry-leading take-up rate to 35%. Our cost to build continues to reduce, enabling us to increase this year's build target to 4.2 million with no additional capex spend. We also expanded our 5G network to cover 80% of the UK population, more than any other operator. These investments in the UK’s next generation networks are enabling much better experiences, reflected in our improved net promoter scores.“We are confirming our EBITDA, capex and cash flow guidance for FY25, albeit on lower revenue guidance. We remain firmly on track to meet our long-term cost savings and cash flow targets, and today announce an interim dividend of 2.40pps. The accelerated modernisation of our operations, combined with a focus on connecting the UK, puts us in a strong position to generate significant value for all our stakeholders.”  \n---  \n  \n**Solid progress on strategic priorities**\n\n  * **Record FTTP build rate** of 2.1m in the half with **FTTP footprint** passing 16m premises, around half of the UK, in October. We have increased our FY25 build target to 4.2m within our existing capex envelope driven by build cost efficiencies; on track to reach 25m by December 2026\n  * **Strong customer demand for Openreach FTTP** with record net adds of 446k in Q2; total premises connected 5.5m with an increased and market-leading take up rate of 35%. Growth in FTTP as a proportion of the broadband base contributed to a reduction in 12-month repair volumes of 0.3m to 3.0m, supporting growth in margin and EBITDA\n  * **Openreach broadband ARPU** in H1grew year-on-year by 6% to £16, ahead of the CPI price increases, driven by a greater FTTP take-up and speed mix; Openreach broadband line losses in H1 were 377k, a 2% decline in the broadband base - we continue to see moderately higher competitor losses with a weaker overall broadband and new homes market\n  * **Retail FTTP base** grew by 35% year-on-year to 3.0m of which Consumer 2.8m and Business 0.2m; **5G base** 12.5m, up 25% year-on-year\n  * **Consumer postpaid mobile base** at 13.9m; **Consumer broadband base** marginally lower at 8.2m. **Consumer ARPUs** relatively stable despite lower CPI benefits\n  * **Business revenue** decline due primarily to non-UK trading in our Global and Portfolio channels\n  * **Cost transformation** on track with £433m gross annualised cost savings during H1 FY25; Total Labour Resource down 2k to 118k and down 4% year-on-year\n  * **BT Group NPS** of 25.6, up 3.1pts year-on-year, further improving customer experience\n\n\n\n**Continued EBITDA and normalised free cash flow 1 improvement:**\n\n  * **Adjusted 1** **revenue** £10.1bn, down 3% mainly due to challenging conditions in Business, principally driven by non-UK trading in our Global and Portfolio channels. In the rest of the Group, lower CPI benefit and continued competitive markets in Consumer were broadly offset by growth in Openreach due to the benefit of price increases, Ethernet base growth and improving FTTP volume and mix; **reported revenue** £10.1bn, down 3%\n  * **Adjusted 1 EBITDA **£4.1bn, up 1%, with revenue flow through more than offset by cost transformation\n  * **Reported profit before tax** £1.0bn, down 10% primarily due to lower revenue, higher specific costs and higher net finance expenses, partly offset by reduction in reported operating costs\n  * **Capital expenditure ('capex')** £2.3bn, down 2% with peak reported capex passed in FY24, primarily driven by lower networks spend despite higher FTTP build due to reduced unit costs and efficiencies; cash capex of £2.5bn in line with prior year\n  * **Net cash inflow from operating activities** £3.0bn; **normalised free cash flow 1** £0.7bn, up 57% due to higher EBITDA, working capital timing and a tax refund\n  * **Net debt** £20.3bn (31 March 2024: £19.5bn), increased mainly due to our scheduled pension scheme contributions of £0.8bn with cash inflow offset by payment of the final dividend\n  * **Gross IAS 19 pension deficit** of £4.3bn, a decrease from £4.8bn at 31 March 2024 mainly due to scheduled contributions, partly offset by lower than required asset returns in the period\n  * **Interim dividend** of 2.40 pence per share (pps) up from 2.31pps in H1 FY24 in line with our policy of paying 30% of prior year's full year dividend pps. FY24 final dividend paid in September was fully covered by normalised free cash flow1\n  * **FY25 Outlook** : FY25 guidance reiterated for adjusted EBITDA1, capital expenditure and normalised free cash flow1. FY25 revenue guidance revised to down 1-2% primarily reflecting weaker non-UK trading including reduced low-margin kit sales, along with a softer environment in Corporate and Public Sector\n  * **Mid-term guidance:** Sustained adjusted1 revenue growth and EBITDA growth ahead of revenue, enhanced by cost transformation from FY26 to FY30; capital expenditure excluding spectrum less than £4.8bn until FY26, reducing by c. £1bn post peak FTTP build; normalised free cash flow of c. £2.0bn in FY27 and c. £3.0bn by the end of the decade\n\n\n\n![BT Group half year results](https://content.presspage.com/uploads/2429/73814818-bc44-4443-bbe8-876aedecb1c4/h1-fy25-results.jpg?x=1730927688854)\n\n**Customer-facing unit updates**\n\n![BT Group half year results - Customer-facing unit updates](https://content.presspage.com/uploads/2429/7ba28d22-30ab-40f4-9e4a-3ee1f96ef55e/h1-fy25-business-results.jpg?x=1730921470536)\n\n1 See Glossary.2 Net debt was £19,479m at 31 March 2024.n/m: comparison not meaningful\n\n**Glossary**\n\n**Adjusted**|  Adjusted measures (including adjusted revenue, adjusted operating costs, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted basic earnings per share) are before specific items. Adjusted results are consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and assist in providing an additional analysis of the reporting trading results of the group.  \n---|---  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, before specific items, share of post tax profits/losses of associates and joint ventures and net finance expense.  \n**Free cash flow**|  Net cash inflow from operating activities after net capital expenditure.  \n**Capital expenditure**|  Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the period.  \n**Normalised free cash flow**|  Free cash flow (net cash inflow from operating activities after net capital expenditure) after net interest paid, payment of lease liabilities, net cash flows from the sale of cash flows related to contract assets, monies received as prepayment for the sale of redundant copper, dividends received from non-current assets investments, associates and joint ventures, and net purchase or disposal of non-current asset investments, before pension deficit payments (including their cash tax benefit), payments relating to spectrum, and specific items. It excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends paid, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals, repayment and raising of debt, cash flows relating to loans with joint ventures, and cash flows relating to the Building Digital UK demand deposit account which have already been accounted for within normalised free cash flow. For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis.  \n**Net debt**|  Loans and other borrowings and lease liabilities (both current and non-current), less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet. Amounts due to joint ventures, loans and borrowings recognised in relation to monies received from the sale of cash flows of contract assets and as prepayment for the forward sale of redundant copper are excluded. Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated into sterling at swapped rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method are removed.  \n**Specific items**|  Items that in management’s judgement need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. In the current period these relate to our assessment of our provision for historic regulatory matters, restructuring charges, divestment-related items, Sports JV-related items and net interest expense on pensions. In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.  \n  \nWe assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
