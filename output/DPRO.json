(NASDAQ: DPRO) (CSE: DPRO) (FSE: 3U8A) (“Draganfly” or the “Company”), a drone solutions, and systems developer, today announced that it has closed its previously announced offering of 1,600,000 units of the Company, with each unit consisting of one common share (or one pre-funded warrant to purchase one common share in lieu thereof) and one warrant to purchase one common share. Each unit was sold at an offering price of US$2.35, for gross proceeds of US$3.76 million (the “Offering”), before deducting placement agent discounts and offering expenses. The warrants have an exercise price of CA$3.3086 (or US$2.35) per share, are exercisable immediately and will expire five years following the date of issuance and the exercise price is in Canadian currency.\n\nMaxim Group LLC acted as sole placement agent for the Offering.\n\nPursuant to previous offerings in the United States, the Company issued warrants to purchase 256,000 common shares at an exercise price of CA$5.6925 (US$4.1152) on October 30, 2023 (“October Warrants”), warrants to purchase 540,541 common shares at an exercise price of CA$5.625 (US$4.1155) on May 1, 2024 (the “May Warrants”) and warrants to purchase 666,667 common shares at an exercise price of CA$5.12 (US$3.75) on August 21, 2024 (the “August Warrants”, collectively with the October Warrants and May Warrants, the “Existing Warrants”). In connection with the closing of the Offering, the ‎Company and the holder of the Existing Warrants entered into an amendment agreement (the “Amendment Agreement”), whereby the ‎exercise price of the Existing Warrants was reduced to CA$3.3086 (or US$2.35) per share, respectively (the “Warrant Amendments”).‎\n\nDraganfly currently intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund its capabilities to meet demand for its new products including growth initiatives and/or for working capital requirements including the continuing development and marketing of the Company’s core products, potential acquisitions and research and development.\n\nThe Offering was made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form F-10, as amended, (File No. 333-271498) previously filed with and subsequently declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on July 5, 2023 and the Company’s Canadian short form base shelf prospectus dated June 30, 2023 (the “Base Shelf Prospectus”). Draganfly offered and sold the securities in the United States only.

          "content": "SHARE CONSOLIDATION Q&A\n1. Q. If the number of Draganfly Inc. Common Shares in my online broker account decreases\nsignificantly, what has happened?\nA. The board of directors of Draganfly Inc. (“Draganfly” or the “Company”) authorized a consolidation\nof the Company’s issued and outstanding common shares (“Common Shares”) on the basis of one\n(1) post-consolidated Common Share for every twenty five (25) pre-consolidated Common Shares\n(the “Consolidation”). The Consolidation will reduce the number of Common Shares of the\nCompany by a factor of 25 on or around September 3, 2024.\nAs an example, a shareholder that held 100,000 Common Shares would hold 4,000 Common\nShares after the Consolidation.\n2. Q. I held 1,755 Common Shares of Draganfly in my investment account prior to the Consolidation.\nWith a 25:1 consolidation ratio, will there be 70.2 Common Shares in my investment account or\nanother number?\nA. Consistent with the terms of the Consolidation as described in the news release dated August 23,\n2024, no fractional Common Shares will be issued in connection with the Consolidation and any\nfractional shares that would otherwise have been issued will be rounded up to the nearest whole\nnumber. Accordingly, your Common Shares held will be rounded up to 71.\nThe exercise price and/or conversion price and number of Common Shares issuable under any of\nthe Company’s outstanding convertible securities will also be proportionately adjusted in\nconnection with the Consolidation.\n3. Q. How will the Consolidation impact share price?\nA. On August 23, 2024, Draganfly announced the 25:1 Consolidation with an effective date of\nSeptember 3, 2024. It is currently anticipated that the Common Shares will begin trading on a post-\nConsolidation basis at market open on September 3, 2024. As a result, there will be 1/25th the\nnumber of Common Shares trading on September 3, 2024 in comparison to the number of Common\nShares that trading on September 2, 2024. Also, the price per Common Share will increase\neffective as of market open on September 3, 2024 as a result of the decrease in the number of\nCommon Shares outstanding and trading.\nFor example, if the Common Shares were to close at $0.30 on September 2, 2024 and a\nshareholder held 100,000 Common Shares on that day, those Common Shares would be worth\n$30,000 in the aggregate. On September 3, 2024, following the Consolidation, that shareholder\nwould have 4,000 Common Shares (100,000 / 25). However, these Common Shares would have\na value of CAD $7.50 each following the Consolidation ($0.30 x 25). Accordingly, the aggregate\nvalue held by the shareholder would remain unchanged at $30,000 (4,000 x $7.50).\n4. Q. Why has Draganfly decided to execute the Consolidation?\nA. The Consolidation is being executed primarily in an effort to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq\nminimum bid price requirement so that Draganfly will be in compliance with listing requirements of\nthe Nasdaq on which the Company’s Common Shares are traded."

This presentation does not contain all of the information that would normally appear in a prospectus or registration statement under\napplicable Canadian or United States securities laws. Readers should not construe the contents of this presentation as investment, legal, tax, regulatory, financial or accounting advice and are urged to consult with\ntheir own advisers in relation to such matters.\nThe Company does not make any representation or warranty (express or implied) as to the accuracy or completeness of the information in this presentation. Except as may be required by applicable law, the\nCompany expressly disclaims any obligation to update any of the information contained herein or to inform readers of any matters of which it becomes aware that may affect any matter referred to in this\npresentation. Certain information in this presentation is based on management estimates. Such estimates have been made in good faith and represent the current beliefs of management. Management believes\nthat such estimates are founded on reasonable grounds. However, by their nature, estimates may not be correct or complete. Accordingly, no representation or warranty (express or implied) is given that such\nestimates are correct or complete. Market data and certain industry data and forecasts included in this presentation were obtained from internal company surveys, market research, publicly available information,\nreports of governmental agencies and industry publications and surveys. Where this presentation quotes any information or data from any third-party source, it should not be interpreted that the Company has\nadopted or endorsed such information or data as being accurate. The Company has not independently verified any of such information from third-party sources or any underlying assumptions. Accordingly, the\nCompany makes no representation or warranty (express or implied) on the fairness, accuracy, completeness or correctness of any such third-party information.\nCertain statements contained in this presentation, other than statements of fact that are independently verifiable at the date hereof, may constitute “forward-looking information” within the meaning of Canadian\nsecurities legislation and “forward looking statements” within the meaning of US securities legislation “(selectively”forward-statements”). Forward-looking statements are frequently, but not always, identified by\nwords such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “estimates,” “potential,” “possible,” “projects,” “plans,” and similar expressions. Such statements, based as they are on the current expectations of\nmanagement, inherently involve numerous important risks, uncertainties and assumptions, known and unknown, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.
