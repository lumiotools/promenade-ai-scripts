Minor differences may exist due to rounding.   \n---  \n  \nIn September, Spectrum launched a new brand platform, _Life Unlimited_ , which emphasizes the power of Spectrum's advanced network and cutting-edge connectivity products and services to create opportunities and remove barriers to help customers live their best lives. As part of its new brand platform, Spectrum launched a new and simplified pricing strategy that better utilizes its seamless connectivity and entertainment products to offer lower promotional and persistent bundled pricing to drive growth. Additionally, Spectrum announced new customer commitments focused on reliable connectivity, transparency, exceptional service and a focus on always improving.\n\nThird quarter total Internet customers decreased by 110,000, driven by the end of the FCC's Affordable Connectivity Program (\"ACP\") in the second quarter, compared to an increase of 63,000 during the third quarter of 2023. _Spectrum Internet_ ® delivers the fastest Internet speeds1 in the nation. Spectrum is evolving its connectivity network to offer symmetrical and multi-gigabit Internet speeds across its entire footprint and has launched symmetrical Internet service in eight markets. Unlike competitors, Spectrum upgrades its network for all households and can do so at a much lower cost. Spectrum Advanced WiFi, a managed WiFi service that provides customers an optimized home network while providing greater control of connected devices with enhanced security and privacy is available to all _Spectrum Internet_ customers.\n\nTotal video customers decreased by 294,000 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a decline of 327,000 in the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Charter had 13.0 million total video customers. Spectrum TV Select video customers will soon receive up to $80 per month of programmers' streaming application retail value at no extra cost, including the ad-supported versions of Max, Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, ESPN+, AMC+, Discovery+, BET+, ViX, and Tennis Channel Plus. This programmer streaming application inclusion is part of Charter's broader video evolution strategy to provide flexible packages with enhanced value, whether through full packages with seamless entertainment, smaller video packages, or a suite of a-la-carte programmer application options for broadband-only customers.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, total wireline voice customers declined by 288,000, compared to a decline of 286,000 in the third quarter of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Charter had 7.2 million total wireline voice customers.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Charter added 545,000 total mobile lines, compared to growth of 594,000 during the third quarter of 2023. _Spectrum Mobile™_ is available to all new and existing _Spectrum Internet_ customers and offers the fastest overall speeds,2 with plans that include 5G access, do not require contracts and include taxes and fees in the price. _Spectrum Mobile_ is central to Charter's converged network strategy to provide consumers a differentiated connectivity experience with highly competitive, simple data plans and pricing.\n\nCharter continues to work with federal, state and local governments to bring _Spectrum Internet_ to unserved and underserved communities. During the third quarter of 2024, Charter activated 114,000 subsidized rural passings. Within Charter's subsidized rural footprint, total customer relationships increased by 41,000 in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n1.| Based on Broadband Download Speed nationally in Opensignal USA: Fixed Broadband Experience Report – National View, May 2024.

Year-over-year revenue growth was favorably impacted by $68 million of total customer credits in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023.\n\nResidential revenue totaled $10.8 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 0.3% year-over-year. Year-over-year revenue growth was favorably impacted by $63 million of residential customer credits in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023.\n\nThird quarter 2024 monthly residential revenue per residential customer totaled $121.47, and increased by 1.8% compared to the prior year period. The growth was driven by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments, the growth of _Spectrum Mobile_ and $63 million of residential customer credits in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023, partly offset by a lower mix of video customer relationships and a higher mix of lower priced video packages within Charter's video customer base.\n\nInternet revenue grew by 1.7% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, driven by promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, partly offset by lower bundled revenue allocation and a decline in Internet customers during the last year.\n\nVideo revenue totaled $3.7 billion in the third quarter, a decrease of 6.7% compared to the prior year period, driven by a decline in video customers during the last year and a higher mix of lower priced video packages within Charter's video customer base, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups, video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases and the aforementioned $63 million of residential customer credits recorded in September 2023.\n\nVoice revenue decreased by 5.0% year-over-year to $360 million, driven by a decline in wireline voice customers over the last twelve months, partly offset by voice rate adjustments.\n\nThird quarter mobile service revenue totaled $801 million, an increase of 37.6% year-over-year, driven by mobile line growth and higher bundled revenue allocation.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by 2.0% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, driven by enterprise and SMB revenue growth of 3.7% and 1.0% year-over-year, respectively. The year-over-year increase in third quarter 2024 SMB revenue was driven by higher monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to rate adjustments. Enterprise revenue excluding wholesale increased by 5.9% year-over-year, mostly reflecting PSU growth.\n\nThird quarter advertising sales revenue of $452 million increased by 18.1% compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher political revenue. Excluding political revenue in both periods, advertising sales revenue decreased by 6.3% year-over-year due to a more challenged advertising market, partly offset by higher advanced advertising revenue.\n\nOther revenue totaled $756 million in the third quarter, an increase of 11.6% compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales.\n\n_Operating Costs and Expenses_\n\nThird quarter programming costs decreased by $259 million, or 10.0% as compared to the third quarter of 2023, reflecting fewer video customers and a higher mix of lower cost packages within Charter's video customer base, partly offset by contractual programming rate increases and renewals and a $61 million benefit in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023. \n\nOther costs of revenue increased by $219 million, or 15.8% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and mobile service direct costs.\n\nCosts to service customers decreased by $12 million, or 0.5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower labor costs.\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $40 million, or 4.4% year-over-year, given Spectrum's continued focus on driving growth and the launch of its new brand platform, _Life Unlimited_.\n\nOther expenses increased by $25 million, or 2.3% as compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\n_Net Income Attributable to Charter Shareholders_\n\nNet income attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2023, with higher Adjusted EBITDA mostly offset by higher other expenses, net primarily due to non-cash changes in the value of financial instruments.\n\nNet income per basic common share attributable to Charter shareholders totaled $8.99 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $8.42 during the same period last year. The increase was primarily the result of the factors described above in addition to a 4.5% decrease in basic weighted average common shares outstanding versus the prior year period.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nThird quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $5.6 billion grew by 3.6% year-over-year, reflecting growth in revenue and operating expenses of 1.6% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\n_Capital Expenditures_\n\nCapital expenditures totaled $2.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $398 million compared to the third quarter of 2023, driven by lower spend on CPE and upgrade/rebuild (primarily network evolution). Line extensions capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market fill-in opportunities.\n\nCharter now expects full year 2024 capital expenditures to total approximately $11.5 billion, a decrease from Charter's previous expectation of approximately $12.0 billion. The decrease primarily reflects lower expected network evolution and line extension spend in 2024, partly offset by higher expected rebuild spend related to plant restoration following recent hurricanes. Charter now expects full year 2024 network evolution spend of approximately $1.1 billion versus prior expectations of approximately $1.6 billion, due to the timing of software certification and integration. Charter now expects full year 2024 line extensions spend of approximately $4.3 billion versus $4.5 billion previously, reflecting a temporary shift in labor resources for plant restoration efforts following hurricanes Helene and Milton. The actual amount of capital expenditures in 2024 will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the pace of Charter's network evolution and expansion initiatives, supply chain timing and growth rates in Charter's residential and commercial businesses.\n\n_Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow_\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $3.9 billion, in-line with the prior year quarter, with higher Adjusted EBITDA offset by higher cash taxes.\n\nFree cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of $522 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by lower capital expenditures and a more favorable change in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.\n\n_Liquidity & Financing_\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total principal amount of debt was $95.1 billion and Charter's credit facilities provided approximately $5.5 billion of additional liquidity in excess of Charter's $721 million cash position.\n\n_Share Repurchases_\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, Charter purchased 844 thousand shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for $262 million.\n\n_**Webcast**_\n\nCharter will host a webcast on Friday, November 1, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) related to the contents of this release.\n\nThe webcast can be accessed live via the Company's investor relations website at [_ir.charter.com_](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4292752-1&h=3590148332&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.charter.com%2F&a=ir.charter.com). Participants should go to the webcast link no later than 10 minutes prior to the start time to register. The webcast will be archived at [_ir.charter.com_](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4292752-1&h=3590148332&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.charter.com%2F&a=ir.charter.com) two hours after completion of the webcast.\n\n_**Additional Information Available on Website**_\n\nThe information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which will be posted on the \"Results & SEC Filings\" section of the Company's investor relations website at [_ir.charter.com_](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4292752-1&h=3590148332&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.charter.com%2F&a=ir.charter.com), when it is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). A slide presentation to accompany the conference call and a trending schedule containing historical customer and financial data will also be available in the \"Results & SEC Filings\" section.\n\n**Use of Adjusted EBITDA and** **Free Cash Flow Information**\n\nThe Company uses certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") to evaluate various aspects of its business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to net income attributable to Charter shareholders and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, in the Addendum to this release.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Charter shareholders plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, other income (expenses), net and other operating (income) expenses, net, such as special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of the Company's businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by the Company's capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and the cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures. \n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures. \n\nManagement and Charter's board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to assess Charter's performance and its ability to service its debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under the Company's credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by its operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. The Company's debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which were $373 million and $345 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**About Charter**\n\nCharter Communications, Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES**  \n---  \n**FOOTNOTES**  \n(a)| Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Charter shareholders plus net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, other (income) expenses, net and other operating (income) expenses, net such as special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.  \n(b)| Other expense excludes stock compensation expense. Total operating costs and expenses excludes stock compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and other operating (income) expenses, net.  \n(c)| We calculate the aging of customer accounts based on the monthly billing cycle for each account in accordance with our collection policies. On that basis, at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and September 30, 3023, customers included approximately 127,300, 79,400, 135,800 and 143,300 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 60 days past due, approximately 11,900, 10,000, 54,700 and 53,400 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 90 days past due and approximately 11,800, 13,500, 286,000 and 261,700 customers, respectively, whose accounts were over 120 days past due. The decrease in accounts past due is predominately due to revisions to customer account balances associated with the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program, including balance write-offs and conversion to payment plans. Bad debt expense associated with these past due accounts was predominantly reflected in our consolidated statements of operations in prior periods.  \n(d)| Passings represent our estimate of the number of units, such as single family homes, apartment and condominium units and SMB and enterprise sites passed by our cable distribution network in the areas where we offer the service indicated. These estimates are based upon the information available at this time and are updated for all periods presented when new information becomes available.  \n(e)| Customer relationships include the number of customers that receive one or more levels of service, encompassing Internet, video, voice and mobile services, without regard to which service(s) such customers receive. Customers who reside in residential multiple dwelling units (\"MDUs\") and that are billed under bulk contracts are counted based on the number of billed units within each bulk MDU.
