In light of the pending merger of the Company with UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, Amedisys will not conduct a quarterly earnings call to discuss the third quarter results.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) to non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules are as follows: (1) adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income (loss) attributable to Amedisys, Inc. before net interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, excluding certain items; (2) adjusted net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc., defined as net income (loss) attributable to Amedisys, Inc. calculated in accordance with GAAP excluding certain items; and (3) adjusted net income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. per diluted share, defined as net income (loss) attributable to Amedisys, Inc. common stockholders per diluted share calculated in accordance with GAAP excluding certain items. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, are useful gauges of our current performance and are also included in internal management reporting. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not more meaningful than or as an alternative to, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release and the company’s financial statements. Non-GAAP measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since not all companies calculate these non-GAAP measures consistently.\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nAmedisys, Inc.

(Nasdaq: AMED), announced they have been selected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to participate in a new Medicare alternative payment model designed to support people living with dementia and their caregivers. Under CMS’ [Guiding an Improved Dementia Experience (GUIDE) Model,](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AUKXHOABcha7kqS-hSqm81kprHIAPawZ7vMFQh7N_agsddAidZ8nk2m9pzM2u0cvr5QbyVCP2P_5w8s5Xy7WqoFfu4rmgqww1Yyoue6TPmO32aORvyW9R9t2hDgIsUmC-YcLg3tcTa5JnZ0Qd5K1clYlBm6rW4ShoZRgoTecS8c=) Contessa will be one of almost 400 participants building Dementia Care Programs (DCPs) across the country, working to increase care coordination and improve access to services and supports, including respite care, for people living with dementia and their caregivers. \n\n“CMS is excited to partner with Contessa under the GUIDE Model,” said CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. “GUIDE is a new approach to how Medicare will pay for the care of people living with dementia. The GUIDE participants are envisioning new ways to support not only people living with dementia, but also to reduce strain on the people who care for them, so that more Americans can remain in their homes and communities, rather than in institutions.”\n\nLaunched on July 1, 2024, the GUIDE Model will test a new payment approach for key supportive services furnished to people living with dementia, including: comprehensive, person-centered assessments and care plans; care coordination; 24/7 access to an interdisciplinary care team member or help line; and certain respite services to support caregivers. People with dementia and their caregivers will have the assistance and support of a Care Navigator to help them access clinical and non-clinical services such as meals and transportation through community-based organizations. \n\n“Our team of nurse practitioners, nurses, and social workers have tremendous experience in helping patients and caregivers navigate through the complex world of healthcare. Through the GUIDE Model, we are able to apply this clinical model for dementia patients and their caregivers to allow this vulnerable population to be able to live at home longer and achieve a better quality of life,” said Gavin Baumgardner, DO, MHA, Contessa’s Vice President and National Medical Director of Palliative Care at Home.\n\nContessa’s participation in the GUIDE Model will help people living with dementia and their caregivers have access to education and support, such as training programs on best practices for caring for a loved one living with dementia. The GUIDE Model also provides respite services for certain people, enabling caregivers to take temporary breaks from their caregiving responsibilities. Respite is being tested under the GUIDE Model to assess its effect on helping caregivers continue to care for their loved ones at home, preventing or delaying the need for facility care.\n\nGUIDE Participants represent a wide range of health care providers, including large academic medical centers, small group practices, community-based organizations, health systems, hospice agencies, and other practices.\n\nThis model delivers on a promise in the Biden Administration’s Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers and aligns with the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease.

It explains the\ndecision making process used by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”), the reasoning behind our\nexecutive compensation program, and, more specifically, the actions the Compensation Committee took related to the compensation of our “Named\nExecutive Officers,” as defined under the SEC’s executive compensation disclosure rules.\nEffective April 10, 2023, our Board of Directors appointed Richard Ashworth to serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer and elected\nMr. Ashworth as a director. Paul B. Kusserow ceased serving as Chief Executive Officer effective on April 10, 2023 but continues to serve as our\nChairman of the Board.\nAccordingly, our Named Executive Officers for 2023 are as follows:\n• Richard Ashworth—Chief Executive Officer (effective April 10, 2023);\n• Paul B.

The Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement.\n• Retention Compensation in Connection with Pending Merger:\n• Retention Equity Awards Granted to Messrs. Ashworth and Ginn: On June 26, 2023, the Compensation Committee\napproved one-time equity award grants of time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that vest ratably over three years to\nMr. Ashworth, with a $2.5 million grant date value, and to Mr. Ginn, with a $1.5 million grant date value, in exchange for\nMessrs. Ashworth and Ginn agreeing not to resign their employment with UnitedHealth Group for Good Reason (as\ndefined in the CEO Severance Plan (for Mr. Ashworth), the Executive Severance Plan (for Mr. Ginn) and the 2018\nOmnibus Incentive Compensation Plan) due to a material diminution of their authority, responsibilities or duties during the\nsix-month period following the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”).\n• Cash Retention Awards Granted to Mr. Muscato and Ms. Bohnert: In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement,\nthe Compensation Committee approved cash retention awards to Mr. Muscato ($250,000, which was increased to $400,000\nin August 2023 as discussed below) and Ms. Bohnert ($150,000). One-fourth of the retention awards was paid at the time\nof grant, another 1/4 of the awards will be paid upon the closing of the\n10\nMerger, and the remaining 1/2 of the awards will be paid six months after the closing of the Merger, subject to continued\nemployment on each such date. If the closing of the Merger occurs after September 26, 2024, then the amount of the\nretention awards will increase by 20%. If Mr. Muscato or Ms. Bohnert is terminated without cause prior to the final\npayment date, all remaining amounts will be payable to such executive at his or her termination date.\n• Increase in Salary and Retention Compensation for Mr. Muscato: On August 2, 2023, the Compensation Committee\n(1) increased Mr. Muscato’s base salary from $400,000 to $425,000 and (2) increased Mr. Muscato’s merger-related\nretention award from $250,000 to $400,000.\n• Target (100%) Payout for Short-Term Incentive (Cash Bonus) Program for 2023 and Performance-Based RSUs Earned Above\nTarget Based on 2023 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Amedisys, Inc. Before Net Interest Expense, Provision for Income Taxes\nand Depreciation and Amortization, Excluding Certain Items (“Adjusted EBITDA”) (Subject to Adjustment Up or Down Based\non 3-Year Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)):\n• Short-Term Incentive (Cash Bonus) Payout of 100% of Target for 2023: The Named Executive Officers earned 100% of\ntheir respective target bonus amounts for 2023 based on 2023 Adjusted EBITDA performance above the target level of\nperformance, resulting in the collective 2023 short-term incentive plan paying out at the target (100%) level pursuant to the\nterms of the Merger Agreement. Additional information on this topic appears under the heading “Details of our 2023\nExecutive Compensation Program—2023 Annual Performance-Based Incentive Compensation (Cash Bonuses).”\n• 127.23% of Performance-Based RSUs Earned Based on 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Performance: Adjusted EBITDA for 2023\nfell between the target and stretch (maximum) level of performance, resulting in 127.23% of the target number of\nperformance-based RSUs being earned based on the 2023 financial performance measure. The number of performance-\nbased RSUs that were earned based on achievement of the 2023 adjusted EBITDA measure at 127.23% will be adjusted\nupward or downward (from 75% to 125% of the number of performance-based RSUs that were earned based on\nachievement of 2023 adjusted EBITDA) based on the Company’s three-year relative TSR. Such performance-based RSUs\nwill cliff vest after the end of the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2025 (subject to a maximum of\n200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each Amedisys\nperformance-based RSU award held by Amedisys employees will be converted into an equivalent RSU award of\nUnitedHealth Group based on the exchange ratio asset forth in the Merger Agreement, assuming achievement at the target\nlevel of performance with respect to any Amedisys performance-based RSU for which the level of performance-vesting has\nnot yet been determined as of the Effective Time. Additional information on this topic appears under the heading “Details\nof our 2023 Executive Compensation Program—2023 Long-Term Incentives (Equity-Based Compensation).”\n• Appointment of Mr. Ashworth as Chief Executive Officer: In connection with Mr. Ashworth’s appointment as our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, effective on April 10, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved the following compensation terms for\nMr. Ashworth:\n• an annual base salary of $1,000,000;\n• participation in the Company’s annual incentive (cash bonus) plan, with a target bonus of 100% of base salary;\n• an annual equity award grant valued at $5 million, comprised of a mix of time-based stock options (25%) that vest ratably\nover three years, time-based restricted stock units (25%) that vest ratably over three years, and performance-based\nrestricted stock units (50%) that vest based on achievement of an identified performance measure for 2023, subject to\nmodification based on the Company’s relative TSR over a three-year performance period;\n• a one-time equity award grant valued at $2.5 million, comprised of time-based restricted stock units that vest 100% one\nyear from the date of grant;\n11\n• a one-time equity award grant valued at $5 million, comprised of performance-based restricted stock units that vest 100%\non the fifth anniversary of the date of grant if the specified performance condition, tied to performance over the first three\nyears after the date of grant, is met (with a payout of 50% to 300% of the number of restricted stock units granted,\ndepending on the level of performance achieved once a threshold level of performance is met); and\n• a one-time cash payment of $250,000 for relocation and other related expenses.\nOther than the one-time equity awards granted to Mr. Ashworth in connection with his start date and the Company’s payment of\nMr. Ashworth’s relocation expenses, the structure of Mr. Ashworth’s compensation will align with our executive officer compensation\npractices and policies discussed elsewhere in this CD&A.\n• Mr. Kusserow’s 2023 Compensation: Mr. Kusserow received his annual base salary of $900,000 through May 17, 2023 as he\ntransitioned the Chief Executive Officer role to Mr. Ashworth. Effective May 18, 2023, Mr. Kusserow no longer received his base salary\nand once again received compensation for his service as Chairman of the Board, which consists of the annual retainer for service on the\nBoard of $100,000 and an additional annual retainer payable to the Chairman of the Board in the amount of $100,000. In addition,\nMr. Kusserow received a one-time payment of $50,000 for transition services related to Contessa. On January 2, 2023, Mr. Kusserow\nreceived an equity award comprised of 41,313 time-based RSUs, which vested on April 10, 2023, when he ceased serving as Chief\nExecutive Officer. Mr. Kusserow did not receive the 2023 non-employee director annual equity award valued at $150,000 that was granted\nto the Company’s non-employee directors on May 3, 2023, but he will be eligible to receive the non-employee director annual equity\naward beginning in 2024 (so long as Mr. Kusserow continues to serve as a non-employee director at such time).\n• Clawback Policy: In November 2023, we adopted a clawback policy (the “Clawback Policy”), in compliance with the requirements of the\nDodd-Frank Act, final SEC rules and applicable Nasdaq listing standards, which covers our current and former officers subject to\nSection 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including all of our Named Executive Officers.\nUnder the Clawback Policy, if there is a restatement of our financial results, the Company will recover erroneously awarded incentive\ncompensation from such officers during a three-year look back period.\n• In addition, in the first quarter of 2024, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Compensation Committee:\n• approved the 2024 short-term incentive compensation (cash bonus) plan based on three performance measures: a financial\nmeasure of adjusted EBITDA, weighted at 55%, a growth (revenue) measure, weighted at 20%, and a quality measure,\nweighted at 25%; and\n• granted time-based RSUs to the Named Executive Officers on February 16, 2024, which vest ratably over four years from\nthe date of grant.\nSee “2024 Executive Compensation Decisions” below in this CD&A for additional information on the compensation decisions made in early 2024.\nBusiness Overview\nIn 2023, we had the great honor of caring for over 469,000 patients, making more than 10.6 million visits. Other major accomplishments in 2023\nincluded:\n• Maintained the highest Quality of Patient Care star score in the Home Health industry in the Home Health Compare (“HHC”) April 2024\npreview of 4.35 stars, with 96% of our care centers at 4+ Stars and 36 care centers rated at 5 stars;\n12\n• Our Patient Satisfaction star average for the April 2024 HHC preview was 3.72, outperforming the industry average;\n• Outperformed the industry on all Hospice Item Set (“HIS”) measures again in 2023; and\n• Home Health same store total admissions grew 6%.\n2023 Company Performance Highlights\nIn addition to execution on our strategic priorities and high scores for patient quality outlined above, in 2023:\n• Net service revenue increased to $2,236.4 in 2023 compared to $2,223.2 million in 2022;\n• We achieved above the target level of performance for the adjusted EBITDA performance measure, between the threshold and target level\nof performance for the growth (revenue) performance measure, below the threshold level for half of the quality performance measure and\nbetween the target and stretch (maximum) level for the other half of the quality performance measure, and below the threshold level for\nthe people performance measure (all performance goals are defined more fully on pages 19-20); and\n• We generated $137 million in cash flow from operations.\n2023 Say on Pay Vote Results\nAs part of the Compensation Committee’s efforts to ensure that the interests of our Named Executive Officers are aligned with those of our\nstockholders, the Compensation Committee considers the results of the Company’s prior stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation. Our\nmost recent Say on Pay vote was held in 2023 and yielded an approval by 87.8% of the votes cast. Based on this high level of support, we did not make\nany additional changes to the overall structure of our compensation program in 2023 as a result of any specific feedback from stockholders.\n13\nOur Compensation and Governance Practices & Policies\nWe believe the following practices and policies promote sound compensation governance and are in the best interests of our stockholders and\nexecutives:\nWhat We Do What We Do Not Do\n✓ Heavy emphasis on performance-based variable compensation X No significant perquisites\n✓ Majority of long-term incentive awards are performance-based (other X No “single-trigger” termination payments upon a change in control\nthan 2024 grants per the Merger Agreement)\n✓ Align performance measures with business objectives X No hedging of Company stock\n✓ Limit the amounts of variable compensation that may be earned (2x X No guaranteed salary increases\ncap on annual short-term incentive (cash bonus) and cap of 2x target\nshares for performance-based RSUs other than Mr. Ashworth’s\none-time performance-based RSU award, which has a 3x cap)\n✓ Robust stock ownership guidelines for executive officers and X No discretionary bonuses\ndirectors (6x base salary for our Chief Executive Officer; 3x base\nsalary for our other executive officers; and 6x annual base retainer for\nour non-employee directors)\n✓ “Double-trigger” termination payments upon a change in control X No pledging of Company stock (other than for Mr. Kusserow\npursuant to a one-time waiver of this policy granted by the Board\nin 2018 solely with respect to Mr. Kusserow)\n✓ Compensation Committee comprised solely of independent directors X No employment agreements\n✓ Independent compensation consultant X No tax gross-ups on termination payments following a change in\ncontrol\n✓ Regular risk assessments X No repricing or backdating stock options without stockholder\napproval\n✓ Clawback policy applicable to our Section 16 officers X No evergreen provision in equity incentive plan\nOverview of our Executive Compensation Program\nOur executive compensation program consists of:\n• Base salary set with reference to competitive market levels;\n• Annual performance-based incentives (cash bonuses) that are in line with competitive practices;\n• Long-term incentives that are materially performance-based (other than the 2024 grants per terms of the Merger Agreement);\n• Severance, as applicable; and\n• Retirement, health and welfare benefits consistent with those provided to all employees.\nDuring the first fiscal quarter of each year, the Compensation Committee (i) establishes the performance measures under our current year cash bonus\nand long-term (equity-based) incentive compensation plans, as applicable, and (ii) determines whether the performance conditions for recently-\ncompleted performance periods have been satisfied. The Compensation Committee reviews executive officer compensation throughout the year to\ndetermine whether there are going to be any base salary adjustments for, or grants of, long-term incentive equity awards to our executive officers.\n14\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nOur compensation philosophy, which extends to all employees including our Named Executive Officers, is designed to align employee and stockholder\ninterests. Our objective is to pay fairly based upon the employee’s position, experience and performance. Employees may be rewarded through\nadditional compensation, for example, in the form of a cash bonus or equity, when we meet or exceed targeted business objectives. Certain employees\nare also eligible to receive incentive compensation based on both individual and/or Company performance.\nOur approach to annual compensation for our executive officers aligns with competitive norms while reflecting our pay for performance philosophy and\nmotivating our executives to continued achievement of business objectives and stockholder value creation. Our executive officer compensation approach\nincludes:\n• the review of executive salaries annually but only making adjustments periodically, based on performance or change in role and other\nfactors, and not automatically on an annual basis;\n• balancing the performance measures for our short-term incentives (cash bonus) across corporate financial and corporate strategic measures\nthat are critical to long-term success in the healthcare industry: quality of care to our patients and the retention and engagement of our\npeople;\n• a scaled payout of short-term incentives (cash bonus) at 50%-200% of target depending on actual level of performance achieved compared\nto threshold, target, and maximum levels of performance objectives;\n• at least 50% of long-term incentives are in the form of performance-based equity (other than the 2024 grants pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement);\n• a scaled payout of performance-based restricted stock units at 50%-200% of target depending on actual level of performance achieved for\nour annual equity awards; and\n• tying 100% of executive incentive payouts to achievement of corporate-level performance objectives within metrics we believe contribute\nto stockholder value creation.\nThe objectives of our compensation philosophy are described below:\n• Stockholder-aligned. Our Named Executive Officers have most of their incentive compensation aligned with our Company’s overall\nfinancial performance through cash bonus programs and equity grants, the value of which is directly tied to change in share value.\n• Performance-based. Our Named Executive Officers’ annual incentive compensation is linked to the Company’s overall performance.\n• Market-driven. We structure our compensation programs to be competitive in the total compensation that they offer.\n• Focused on the individual. We design our incentive compensation programs to attract, motivate and retain our Named Executive Officers.\nCompensation Administration\nRole of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for the review and approval of all aspects of our executive\ncompensation program and makes all decisions regarding the compensation of our executive officers. These responsibilities include:\n• Review and approval of corporate long-term and short-term incentive goals and objectives relevant to executive compensation;\n• Evaluation of the performance of our Chief Executive Officer and review of our Chief Executive Officer’s evaluation of the performance\nof our other executive officers;\n15\n• Evaluation of the competitiveness of the total compensation package for our executive officers;\n• Evaluation and approval of executive officer employment, severance and change-in-control agreements, including any amendments\nthereto, and any title change for any executive officer; and\n• Approval of any changes to the total compensation package for our executive officers, including but not limited to changes to benefits,\nbase salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity incentive award opportunities and retention programs.\nAdditional information regarding the Compensation Committee’s responsibilities is set forth in its charter, a copy of which appears on the “Investors”\nsubpage of our website (www.amedisys.com) under the link “Governance.” Information from this website is not incorporated by reference into this\nAmendment No. 1.\nRole of Independent Compensation Consultants. The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain experts to assist the Compensation Committee\nin fulfilling its duties. In 2023, the Compensation Committee retained Pay Governance as its compensation consultant (the “Consultant”). In 2023, the\nConsultant provided the following consulting services to the Compensation Committee:\n• Provided advice and analysis with respect to the compensation paid to Mr. Ashworth upon his appointment as Chief Executive Officer.\n• Provided compensation benchmarking information for our Chief Executive Officer position and our executive officer positions that report\ndirectly to our Chief Executive Officer.\n• Provided analysis and advice regarding the compensation peer group used for providing market pay program, levels, and design\ninformation.\n• Provided analysis and support in relation to the Compensation Committee’s review and discussion of our compensation philosophy and\nstrategy for delivering short and long-term incentives.\n• Reviewed and provided observations on our executive compensation practices in relation to those of our peers and industry comparators.\n• Provided advice and analysis regarding the calculations and presentation of the Company’s pay versus performance disclosure in the\nCompany’s 2023 proxy statement.\n• Provided advice and analysis regarding the calculation of the Company’s CEO to median employee pay ratio.\n• Provided compensation benchmarking information for our non-executive directors.\n• Provided analysis and advice regarding the Company’s share usage (“run rate”) and dilution (“overhang”) in connection with the\nCompensation Committee’s ongoing review of the Company’s equity compensation program.\n• Provided updates regarding compensation-related issues, trends and regulatory changes.\nBecause the Consultant did not and does not provide any non-compensation related services to our Company and based on a review of the Consultant’s\nengagement in relation to the SEC’s guidance on factors to assess in relation to consultant independence, we believe that the Consultant is and was\nindependent of management and provides and provided the Compensation Committee with objective advice. The Compensation Committee retained the\nConsultant directly, although in carrying out assignments, the Consultant also interacted in certain capacities with our management-level employees. All\nsuch assignments are approved by the Chair of the Compensation Committee.\n16\nRole of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. In the course of deliberating certain 2023 compensation decisions for our Named\nExecutive Officers, the Compensation Committee took into account the recommendations of Mr. Ashworth and Mr. Kusserow, as applicable, each of\nwhom served as Chief Executive Officer during a portion of 2023, regarding the compensation of our other executive officers, based upon their\nrespective assessment of each executive officer’s individual role, retention considerations and market factors. The Compensation Committee reviewed\nthese recommendations before making its decision. While the Compensation Committee requested our Chief Executive Officer to be present at certain\nCommittee meetings when executive compensation was discussed, neither Mr. Ashworth nor Mr. Kusserow played any role in the Compensation\nCommittee’s deliberation of matters impacting his own compensation, and only Compensation Committee members are permitted to vote on matters\nrelated to executive officer compensation.\nReview of Peer Group, Industry and Survey Data\nThe peer group used for benchmarking executive officer compensation and non-employee director compensation and compensation design for the first\nhalf of 2023 consisted of the following companies:\n• Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. • LHC Group, Inc.\n• agilon health, inc. • ModivCare Inc.\n• AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. • National HealthCare Corporation\n• Brookdale Senior Living Inc. • Oak Street Health, Inc.\n• Cano Health, Inc. • Option Care Health, Inc.\n• Chemed Corporation • Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.\n• DaVita Inc. • Select Medical Holdings Corporation\n• Encompass Health Corporation • The Ensign Group, Inc.\n• Enhabit, Inc.\nIn early August 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed the composition of the peer group with the Consultant and approved the following peer\ngroup for benchmarking executive officer compensation and non-employee director compensation and compensation design for the remainder of 2023:\n• Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. • LHC Group, Inc.\n• agilon health, inc. • ModivCare Inc.\n• AMN Healthcare Services, Inc. • National HealthCare Corporation\n• Brookdale Senior Living Inc. • Oak Street Health, Inc.\n• Cano Health, Inc. • Option Care Health, Inc.\n• Chemed Corporation • Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.\n• Encompass Health Corporation • Select Medical Holdings Corporation\n• Enhabit, Inc. • The Ensign Group, Inc.\nThe new peer group removes DaVita Inc. due to its size, based on revenue and market capitalization, relative to Amedisys and our other peer group\ncompanies. The Consultant has used the following guidelines in recommending a peer group to the Compensation Committee: (a) primarily included\nhealthcare services and healthcare facilities, (b) similarly-sized based on revenue and market capitalization, and (c) comparable business operations,\nprimarily focusing on home health, hospice and personal care, but also dialysis, ambulatory services, rehabilitation facilities, diagnostic laboratories and\nhealthcare staffing companies.\nEvaluating the Overall Competitiveness and Reasonableness of our 2023 Incentive Compensation Program. Based on its review of the information\ndescribed above, the Compensation Committee determined that the components of our 2023 Named Executive Officer compensation program were\nreasonable.\n17\nWhile the Compensation Committee generally considers available peer group, industry and survey data to be helpful in understanding how our\ncompensation levels compare to other companies, peer group, industry and survey data are only one factor that the Compensation Committee may\nconsider in making its decisions regarding executive compensation. For example, the Compensation Committee also considers the alignment of our\nthen-current compensation practices with our compensation philosophy, program structure, retention and succession goals and other factors (such as the\nintegration of large acquisitions) before making compensation decisions.\nLevel of Compensation. In determining how each executive officer’s total compensation package is allocated among these components, the\nCompensation Committee emphasizes the components that reward the accomplishment of business objectives and create stockholder value.\nConcurrently, the Compensation Committee believes it is appropriate to provide our executive officers with a reasonable level of guaranteed\ncompensation through base salary and benefits, together with significant opportunity for additional compensation through annual and long-term\nincentives that align executive rewards with company performance and stockholder returns. Generally, if targeted performance levels are not achieved,\nour executive officers’ total actual compensation is likely to be at or below the median of comparable positions at similarly-sized public companies in\nour industry. Alternatively, if the targeted performance levels are exceeded, our executive officers’ total actual compensation is likely to be above the\nmedian of comparable positions at similarly-sized public companies in our industry.\nMix of Pay. Our Named Executive Officers have a significant percentage of their total compensation in the form of long-term incentives. The\nCompensation Committee believes this is appropriate because of the direct influence that these officers have on our long-term financial performance.\nGenerally, the majority of the total targeted annual compensation for our Named Executive Officers, is “at risk,” i.e., variable based on Company\nperformance, to assure alignment with stockholder interests.\nDetails of our 2023 Executive Compensation Program\nBase Salaries\nWe target our executive officers’ base salaries to be competitive when compared to the salary levels of persons holding similar positions at\nsimilarly-sized public companies in the healthcare services and facilities sectors. The Compensation Committee also considers each executive officer’s\nrespective responsibilities, experience, expertise and individual performance when setting base salaries.\nBase salaries for our Named Executive Officers in 2022 and 2023 were as follows:\nNamed Executive Officer 2022 Salary 2023 Salary % Change\nRichard Ashworth $ — $1,000,000 — %\nPaul B.

See “Director Compensation” for additional information.\n(2) Effective August 2, 2023.\n18\n2023 Annual Performance-Based Incentive Compensation (Cash Bonuses)\nAs part of our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee establishes annual incentive compensation performance measures for our\nexecutive officers, which performance measures are premised on our Company’s achievement of pre-determined financial or operational goals.\nMr. Kusserow did not participate in the 2023 short-term incentive (cash bonus) program.\n2023 target incentive opportunities were set based on our Company’s historical practices and the Compensation Committee’s desire to provide a\nmeaningful award for achieving outstanding performance. For 2023, the annual short-term incentive (cash bonus) compensation thresholds, targets and\nstretch/maximums were as follows (the Committee uses linearly interpolation to determine payouts in between performance levels listed below):\nWeighted\nPayout (% of\nTarget\nAchievement\nMetric Stretch/ Actual % of Target Metric\nPerformance Measure Weighting Threshold Target Maximum Performance Achievement Weighting)\nAdjusted EBITDA** $ 216.2 $ 240.2 $ 264.2 $ 247.0\n40% Million Million Million Million 127% 50.89%\nRevenue Growth(1)(2) $ 2,215.4 $2,260.6 $ 2,305.8 $ 2,217.3\n20% Million Million Million Million 52% 10.43%\nQuality of Patient Care(1)(3)\nMetrics:\n60-Day ACH 10% 14.1% 13.9% 13.7% 14.5% 0% 0.00%\nHVLDL 10% 80.0% 82.0% 84.0% 82.2% 100% 10.00%\nTotal Quality 20 % 50% 10.00 %\nPeople (Nursing Voluntary\nTurnover) (1) 20% 27.0% 24.0% 21.2% 30.3% 0% 0.00%\nPotential Payout (% of Target) 50%-99.9% 100% Up to 200%\nOverall 100 % 71.32 %(4)\nAdjusted Plan Payout per\nMerger Agreement 100.00%(4)\n** Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Amedisys, Inc. before net interest expense, provision for income taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, excluding certain items.\n(1) Each of the revenue growth, quality of patient care and people performance measures were subject to a performance “gate” requirement that\nadjusted EBITDA be met at the target performance level or higher for any of the revenue growth, quality of patient care and people performance\nmeasures to pay out above the target level.\n(2) The revenue growth measure excludes revenue generated by our high acuity care segment.\n19\n(3) For 2023, the quality of patient care performance measure was based on achievement of threshold, target and stretch/maximum performance goals\nbased on (i) a home health 60-day acute care hospitalization (“ACH”) rate metric and (ii) a hospice visits in the last days of life (“HVLDL”)\nmetric, as follows:\nQuality of Patient Care Performance Measure Improvement Metrics Threshold Target Stretch/Maximum\n60-day ACH 14.1% 13.9% 13.7%\nHVLDL 80.0% 82.0% 84.0%\nIf the Company’s ACH rate, calculated as the percentage of all eligible home health episodes of care that ended in hospitalization out of all completed\nhome health episodes of care within each given 12-month period, was equal to or less than 14.1%, the ACH portion of the quality of patient care\nmeasure would be met, with payout based on a sliding scale (applying linear interpolation for performance between payout levels) as follows; provided\nthat adjusted EBITDA be met at the target performance level or higher for a payout above the target level:\n• 50% of the measure would be earned if the ACH rate were 14.1% or lower but more than 13.9%;\n• 100% of the measure would be earned if the ACH rate were 13.9% or lower but more than 13.7%;\n• up to 200% of the measure would be earned if the ACH rate were 13.7% or lower.\nIf the Company’s HVLDL measure, calculated as the percentage of hospice patients who received in-person visits from a registered nurse or a medical\nsocial worker on at least two of the final three days of life and excluding lengths of stays of two days or less, was greater than or equal to 80.0%, the\nHVLDL portion of the quality of patient care measure would be met, with payout based on a sliding scale (applying linear interpolation for performance\nbetween payout levels) as follows; provided that Adjusted EBITDA be met at the target performance level or higher for a payout above the target level:\n• 50% of the measure would be earned if the HVLDL performance were 80.0% or greater but less than 82.0%;\n• 100% of the measure would be earned if the HVLDL performance were 82.0% or greater but less than 84.0%;\n• up to 200% of the measure would be earned if the HVLDL performance were 84.0% or higher.\nThe 60-day ACH rate and the HVLDL measure had a distribution weighting of 10% each, for a total 20% distribution weighting for the collective\nquality of patient care performance measure.\n(4) Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, if the Company’s adjusted EBITDA performance for 2023 exceeded the target level of\nperformance, the 2023 short-term incentive plan would payout at 100% of target, regardless of the level of performance achieved for the revenue\ngrowth, quality of patient care and people performance measures. Because adjusted EBITDA performance of $247.0 million exceeded the target\nlevel of $240.2 million, the Named Executive Officers each earned 100% of their target bonus opportunity for 2023.\nIn establishing the performance levels, the Compensation Committee considered the target level of performance reasonable and achievable, but not\nwithout management’s significant effort, and established a stretch/maximum performance goal so that the Named Executive Officers had greater\nincentive and greater reward if even higher levels of performance were achieved on each of the adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth, quality of patient\ncare and people performance measures. The Compensation Committee also set a threshold level of performance for each performance measure, such\nthat no bonus would be earned for performance below that level. The Compensation Committee felt it was appropriate to set adjusted EBITDA as 40%\nof the bonus opportunity and revenue growth at 20% of the bonus opportunity because it believes that adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth encourage\nour executive officers to focus on improving earnings and profitable growth. It also believes that these measures are aligned with our overall objective of\ncreating long-term value for our stockholders. The Compensation Committee also believed it was in the best interest of the Company’s stockholders to\nbalance the financial performance measures with reward for the quality of patient care and people performance measures.\n20\nThe Compensation Committee retains the discretion to reduce (but not increase) any Named Executive Officer’s incentive earned based on individual\nperformance. The Compensation Committee did not exercise this discretion in 2023.\nThe Compensation Committee certified the Company’s level of achievement of the performance goals on February 20, 2024. The amount of cash\nbonuses earned by and paid to the Named Executive Officers for 2023 are as follows:\nTarget\nBonus (% of Bonus Earned ($)\nNamed Executive Officer Base Salary Base Salary) (100% of Target)\nRichard Ashworth $1,000,000 100% $ 1,000,000\nScott G. Ginn $ 675,000 100% $ 675,000\nMichael P. North $ 425,000 75% $ 318,750\nNick Muscato $ 425,000 75% $ 318,750\nDenise Bohnert $ 400,000 75% $ 300,000\n2023 Long-Term Incentives (Equity-Based Compensation)\nLong-term incentives, in the form of equity-based compensation, are used to balance the short-term focus of our annual cash incentive compensation\nprogram with performance incentives that generally vest over several years. The Compensation Committee believes that providing long-term incentive\nopportunities supports our compensation philosophy by aligning the interests of our Named Executive Officers, and other long-term incentive\ncompensation plan participants, with those of our stockholders. Currently, all equity-based compensation is granted in accordance with the terms of our\n2018 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan.\nWe believe that grants of equity-based compensation:\n• Motivate participants to focus on the creation of stockholder value in both the short- and long-term;\n• Reinforce the link between the creation of stockholder value and compensation;\n• Enable us to provide competitive levels of total compensation; and\n• Aid in the retention of our Named Executive Officers and other long-term incentive plan participants.\nIt has been our Company’s historical practice to tie a portion of the vesting requirements associated with equity grants to identified performance targets\nset at the grant date. As described in more detail below, in 2023, we introduced a three-year relative TSR modifier to the annual performance-based\nRSUs granted to our executive officers, such that the Company’s TSR ranking at the end of the three-year performance period will adjust upward or\ndownward the payout resulting from achievement of the Company’s adjusted EBITDA performance measure, and the performance-based RSUs will cliff\nvest after the end of the three-year performance period (subject to a maximum of 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs). In connection\nwith the move to a three-year performance period for the performance-based RSUs, we adjusted the vesting period for the annual time-based RSU and\nstock option grants to ratable vesting also over three years to align with the three-year TSR performance period and cliff vesting of the performance-\nbased RSU awards.\n21\nPay for Performance—Annual Equity Awards to our Named Executive Officers (Other Than Our Former Chief Executive Officer). In 2023, the Named\nExecutive Officers other than Mr. Kusserow (who received an equity award in January 2023 in connection with his re-appointment as Chief Executive\nOfficer in November 2022) were awarded equity grants comprised of the following:\nEquity Mix % of Grant Value\nPerformance-Based RSUs 50%\nTime-Based RSUs 25%\nTime-Based Stock Options 25%\nThe performance-based RSUs were subject to achievement of the stated adjusted EBITDA performance goal for 2023, and will be modified upward or\ndownward based on the Company’s three-year relative TSR compared to a peer group of companies. The Compensation Committee believes this\nstrategy will incentivize the Named Executive Officers to increase stockholder value over the performance period of the RSUs and life of the stock\noptions by:\n• Increasing Stockholder Return—the Named Executive Officers’ options were granted with fair market value exercise prices. Therefore,\nthey will not realize any value from their stock options unless the market value of our common stock appreciates. In addition, the three-\nyear relative TSR modifier on the performance-based RSUs further aligns the Named Executive Officers’ interests with the interests of our\nstockholders.\n• Achieving Specified Financial and Operational Goals—50% of the equity awards granted to the Named Executive Officers in 2023 (based\non the value of such awards) relate to performance-based compensation in the form of performance-based restricted stock units.\nThe 2023 annual equity awards were as follows:\nTime-Based\nPerformance-Based Time-Based Stock\nRSUs (# at Target RSUs (#) Options (#)\nDate of Value of Performance) (50% (25% of (25% of\nNamed Executive Officer Grant Award ($) of Award) Award) Award)(1)\nRichard Ashworth 4/12/2023 $5,000,000 31,321 15,661 33,711\nScott G.

The exercise price of the other Named Executive Officers’ stock options is $91.77.\nThe time-based RSUs and stock options vest one-third each year over three years beginning on February 20, 2024, assuming that the Named Executive\nOfficer remains employed by the Company on the applicable vesting date. As discussed above, the performance-based RSUs vest based on achievement\nof the identified performance target for fiscal year 2023 as modified by the Company’s relative TSR, with cliff vesting at the end of the three-year\nperformance period.\nPerformance Measure Established for 2023 Annual Grants. The performance-based RSUs granted in 2023 vest based on our 2023 performance on\nadjusted EBITDA against a pre-established goal, and will be modified upward or downward (from 75% to 125% of the number of performance-based\nRSUs that were earned based on achievement of 2023 adjusted EBITDA) based on the Company’s relative TSR compared to a comparator group of\nhealthcare companies over the three year period ending December 31, 2025 (subject to a maximum payout of 200% of the target number of RSUs), as\nfollows:\nTSR Percentile Rank Modifying Factor\n75th Percentile and Above 125%\n50th Percentile 100%\n25th Percentile and Below 75%\n22\nFor the 2023 annual grants to our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Kusserow), the Compensation Committee set the performance target at\nadjusted EBITDA of $216.2 million (threshold), $240.2 million (target) and $264.2 million (stretch/maximum), with incremental payouts between\nthreshold and target and between target and stretch/maximum calculated on a dollar for dollar basis (i.e. every $1 change in adjusted EBITDA will yield\nan additional payout, once threshold has been met). If threshold was not achieved, the grant would not vest. The Company communicated the adjusted\nEBITDA performance target and related TSR modifier to the executive officers in February 2023; however, after the closing of the divestiture of the\nCompany’s personal care line of business on March 31, 2023, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion and approved revised adjusted\nEBITDA performance targets to account for the divestiture.\nActual adjusted EBITDA performance of $247.0 million was between the target and stretch/maximum level of performance. Accordingly, the Named\nExecutive Officers (other than Mr. Kusserow) earned 127.23% of their respective target number of performance-based RSUs, which will be adjusted\nupward or downward based on the Company’s relative TSR for the three-year period ending December 31, 2025.\nIn setting the financial performance target for the long-term incentive equity awards to our Named Executive Officers at adjusted EBITDA of\n$240.2 million (target), the Compensation Committee considered that adjusted EBITDA is also one of the performance measures for the annual\nincentive compensation (cash bonus) opportunity, but the Compensation Committee believed that it was an appropriate measure for both components of\ncompensation because (i) it is one of several separate measures for the annual incentive compensation (cash bonus) opportunity, (ii) the long-term\nincentive equity awards are also adjusted upward or downward based on three-year TSR performance, and (iii) the Compensation Committee believes\nthat adjusted EBITDA growth encourages our executive officers to focus on improving earnings and profitable growth and that this measure is aligned\nwith our overall objective of creating long-term value for our stockholders.\nEquity Award to Mr. Kusserow for Returning to CEO Role. In January 2023, our Compensation Committee granted a one-time special equity award to\nMr. Kusserow, comprised of 41,313 time-based RSUs, which vested on April 10, 2023, the date Mr. Kusserow ceased to serve as Chief Executive\nOfficer, in connection with Mr. Kusserow’s reappointment as Chief Executive Officer in November 2022. Mr. Kusserow did not receive the annual\nequity award granted to our non-employee directors in May 2023.\nNamed Executive Officer Date of Grant Value of Award ($) Time-Based RSUs (#)\nPaul B. Kusserow 1/2/2023 $ 3,500,000 41,313\nThe time-based RSUs vested on April 10, 2023, when Mr. Kusserow ceased serving as Chief Executive Officer.\nOne-Time Equity Awards to Mr. Ashworth in Connection with Appointment as CEO. In connection with Mr. Ashworth’s appointment as President and\nChief Executive Officer, on April 12, 2023, our Compensation Committee granted to Mr. Ashworth the following equity awards, in addition to the 2023\nannual equity awards granted to all of our Named Executive Officers, which are described under the heading “Pay for Performance—Annual Equity\nAwards to our Named Executive Officers (Other Than Our Former Chief Executive Officer)” above.\n23\nPerformance-Based\nDate of Value of RSUs (# at Target Time-Based Vesting\nNamed Executive Officer Grant Award ($) Performance) RSUs (#) Date\nRichard Ashworth 4/12/2023 $2,500,000 0 31,321 4/12/2024\nRichard Ashworth 4/12/2023 $5,000,000 62,641 0 4/12/2028\nThe performance-based RSUs vest 100% on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant if the specified performance condition, tied to performance after\nthe first three years after the date of grant, is met (with a payout of 50% to 300% of the number of RSUs granted, depending on the level of performance\nachieved once a threshold level of performance is met). The time-based RSUs vest one year from the date of grant.\nOne-Time Awards to Certain of our Named Executive Officers as Consideration for Waiver of “Good Reason” Resignation. In June 2023, in connection\nwith the pending Merger, our Compensation Committee approved equity awards for Messrs. Ashworth and Ginn as consideration for their waiver of\ntheir right to resign for “Good Reason” (as defined in the CEO Severance Plan, Executive Severance Plan and 2018 Omnibus Incentive Compensation\nPlan) as a result of a material diminution of their authority, responsibilities or duties during the six-month period following the Effective Time of the\nMerger. The special, one-time awards were in the form of time-based RSUs that vest ratably over three years from the date of grant, assuming that the\nNamed Executive Officer remains employed on the applicable vesting date. The value and amount of the special, one-time equity awards are as follows:\nNamed Executive Officer Date of Grant Value ($) Time-Based RSUs (#)\nRichard Ashworth 6/26/2023 $2,500,000 27,410\nScott G. Ginn 6/26/2023 $1,500,000 16,446\nEffect of Pending Merger on Outstanding Equity Awards. Upon the Effective Time of the Merger, each outstanding time-based RSU and stock option\naward held by Amedisys employees, including our Named Executive Officers, will convert into an equivalent RSU award or option, as applicable, of\nUnitedHealth Group relating to the number of shares of UnitedHealth Group common stock based on an exchange ratio as set forth in the Merger\nAgreement (with a corresponding adjustment to the exercise price of stock options based on the exchange ratio). In addition, each Amedisys\nperformance-based RSU award held by Amedisys employees will be converted into an equivalent RSU award of UnitedHealth Group based on the\nexchange ratio as set forth in the Merger Agreement, assuming achievement at the target level of performance with respect to any Amedisys\nperformance-based RSU for which the level of performance-vesting has not yet been determined.\nOther Practices, Policies and Guidelines\nBenefits\nOur executive officers also participate in the retirement, health and welfare benefit programs generally available to our other employees, including paid\nvacation and paid Company holidays. In a few limited circumstances, the Company provides other benefits to our executive officers, as detailed in the\ntables following this CD&A, but we limit special benefits and perquisites for use only as necessary to attract and retain executive talent.\nCertain of our executive officers have participated in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under the terms of the ESPP, eligible employees\nmay elect to contribute on an after-tax basis between 1% and 15% of their annual pay through regular payroll deductions to purchase our common stock;\nprovided, however, that an employee may not contribute more than $25,000 to the plan on an annual basis pursuant to Internal Revenue Service\nrestrictions. Shares are purchased at a 15% discount of the market value of our common stock at the close of business on the last day of each fiscal\nquarter. None of the Named Executive Officers have purchased shares under the ESPP since the second quarter 2023 offering period as commencement\nof an offering period after the date of the Merger Agreement is prohibited under the Merger Agreement.\n24\nAmended and Restated Severance Plan for Executive Officers\nThe stated purpose of the Executive Severance Plan is to provide a fair framework in the event of a termination of employment in certain circumstances\nof the Company’s executive officers. To be eligible for benefits under the Executive Severance Plan, an executive (each, a “Covered Executive”) must\n(1) be employed by the Company (through the Company’s common payroll agent, Amedisys Holding, L.L.C.) in the position of an executive officer as\nappointed by the Board of Directors or have been designated in writing by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, as appropriate, as\nbeing covered by the Executive Severance Plan; and (2) have executed and delivered to the Company (and not have revoked or attempted to revoke) the\nCompany’s Executive Protective Covenants Agreement (“EPCA” or other similarly named agreement). Our Chief Executive Officer is entitled to\nreceive severance benefits for certain qualifying terminations pursuant to the separate Amedisys Holding, L.L.C. Amended and Restated Severance Plan\nfor Chief Executive Officer. See “CEO Severance Plan” below.\nIf any Covered Executive is terminated by the Company without “Cause” or resigns with “Good Reason” in each case prior to a “Change in Control,”\neach as defined in the Executive Severance Plan, such Covered Executive shall be entitled to an amount equal to one (1) times the sum of (A) the\nCovered Executive’s base salary, as in effect on the date of employment termination (or in the event a reduction in base salary is a basis for a termination\nwith Good Reason, then the base salary in effect immediately prior to such reduction) and (B) the greater of (x) an amount equal to the cash bonus\nearned by the Covered Executive for the previous fiscal year or (y) an amount equal to the Covered Executive’s short-term incentive bonus target\npercentage for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, multiplied by the Covered Executive’s base salary as in effect on the date of employment\ntermination (or, in the event a reduction in base salary is a basis for termination for Good Reason, then the base salary in effect immediately prior to\nsuch reduction), which amount shall be payable in substantially equal monthly installments in accordance with the Company’s normal payroll practices\nfor a period of 12 months. Further, any unvested equity awards issued in the name of the Covered Executive as of the date of employment termination\nwill vest in accordance with the terms contained in the applicable award agreement for such awards.\nIf any Covered Executive is terminated by the Company without “Cause” or resigns with “Good Reason” in each case within two years following a\n“Change in Control,” such Covered Executive shall be entitled to an amount equal to two (2) times the sum of (A) the Covered Executive’s base salary,\nas in effect on the date of employment termination (or in the event a reduction in base salary is a basis for a termination with Good Reason, then the base\nsalary in effect immediately prior to such reduction) and (B) the greater of (x) an amount equal to the cash bonus earned by the Covered Executive for\nthe previous fiscal year or (y) an amount equal to the Covered Executive’s short-term incentive bonus target percentage for the fiscal year in which the\ntermination occurs, multiplied by the Covered Executive’s base salary, as in effect on the date of employment termination (or, in the event a reduction in\nbase salary is a basis for termination for Good Reason, then the base salary in effect immediately prior to such reduction), which amount shall be\npayable in a lump sum. Further, any unvested equity awards issued in the name of the Covered Executive as of the date of employment termination will\nvest in accordance with the provisions of the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan or any successor thereto.\nTemporary Enhancement of Termination Payments Under Executive Severance Plan During 2023\nAs a result of the executive officer transitions during 2022 and in order to encourage retention of the leadership team, on November 21, 2022, the\nCompensation Committee approved an amendment to the Executive Severance Plan to provide change in control level cash severance benefits upon a\ntermination of a covered executive without Cause or a resignation by a covered executive with Good Reason (each as defined in the Executive\nSeverance Plan) that occurred through the end of calendar year 2023, consisting of a cash payment of two times the sum of (A) the covered executive’s\nbase salary, as in effect on the date of employment termination, and (B) the greater of (x) an amount equal to the cash bonus earned by the covered\nexecutive for the previous fiscal year or (y) an amount equal to the covered executive’s short-term incentive bonus target percentage for the fiscal year\nof the employment termination times the covered executive’s base salary, as in effect on the date of the employment termination. This temporary\nexpansion of severance benefits expired on December 31, 2023.\n25\nCEO Severance Plan\nUnder the terms of the CEO Severance Plan, if the Chief Executive Officer is terminated by the Company without “Cause” or resigns with “Good\nReason” in each case prior to a “Change in Control,” each as defined in the CEO Severance Plan, such Chief Executive Officer will be entitled to an\namount equal to two (2) times the sum of (A) the Chief Executive Officer’s base salary, as in effect on the date of employment termination (or in the\nevent a reduction in base salary is a basis for a termination with Good Reason, then the base salary in effect immediately prior to such reduction), and\n(B) the greater of (x) an amount equal to the cash bonus earned by the Chief Executive Officer for the previous fiscal year or (y) an amount equal to the\nChief Executive Officer’s short-term incentive bonus target percentage for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, multiplied by the Chief\nExecutive Officer’s base salary as in effect on the date of employment termination (or, in the event a reduction in base salary is a basis for termination\nfor Good Reason, then the base salary in effect immediately prior to such reduction), payable in substantially equal monthly installments for a period of\n12 months. Further, any unvested equity awards issued in the name of the Chief Executive Officer as of the date of employment termination will vest in\naccordance with the terms contained in the applicable award agreement for such awards.\nIf the Chief Executive Officer is terminated by the Company without “Cause” or resigns with “Good Reason” in each case within two years following a\n“Change in Control,” such Chief Executive Officer will be entitled to an amount equal to three (3) times the sum of (A) the Chief Executive Officer’s\nbase salary, as in effect on the date of employment termination (or in the event a reduction in base salary is a basis for a termination with Good Reason,\nthen the base salary in effect immediately prior to such reduction), and (B) the greater of (x) an amount equal to the cash bonus earned by the Chief\nExecutive Officer for the previous fiscal year or (y) an amount equal to the Chief Executive Officer’s short-term incentive bonus target percentage for\nthe fiscal year in which the termination occurs, multiplied by the Chief Executive Officer’s base salary as in effect on the date of employment\ntermination (or, in the event a reduction in base salary is a basis for termination for Good Reason, then the base salary in effect immediately prior to\nsuch reduction), payable in a lump sum. Further, any unvested equity awards issued in the name of the Chief Executive Officer as of the date of\nemployment termination will vest in accordance with the provisions of the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended from time to time,\nor any successor thereto.\nMr. Ashworth participates in the CEO Severance Plan. Mr. Kusserow did not participate in the CEO Severance Plan upon his return to the Chief\nExecutive Officer role from November 2022 until April 2023.\nStock Ownership\nIncluded in the Corporate Governance Guidelines adopted by our Board of Directors are stock ownership requirements applicable to our Chief\nExecutive Officer and our other executive officers. In an effort to more closely align our Chief Executive Officer’s interests with those of our\nstockholders, the Chief Executive Officer must own Company shares with a fair market value equal to at least six times his base salary.\nIn addition, each other executive officer of the Company must own Company shares with a fair market value equal to at least three times his or her base\nsalary. Each executive officer is required to retain at least half of the net after-tax shares received upon vesting or exercise of his or her equity awards\nuntil the holding requirement is met.\nOnce the Chief Executive Officer or other executive officer accumulates shares with a value equal to the required multiple of base salary, he or she must\nretain the minimum number of shares originally accumulated to meet the threshold requirement on a going-forward basis. If the Company’s stock price\nsubsequently declines after the stock ownership requirements are met, he or she will not be required to acquire additional shares.\nTax and Accounting Implications of Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee has considered the accounting and tax impact of various elements of compensation provided to our executive officers to\nbalance the potential cost to us with the benefit and value of the compensation to the executive officers, but those considerations have generally not been\na material factor in determining amounts of compensation for our executive officers.\n26\nCompensation Risk Assessment\nOur management believes that our incentive compensation arrangements provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond our organization’s\nability to effectively identify and manage significant risks; are compatible with effective internal controls and the risk management practices of our\nCompany; and are supported by the oversight and administration of the Compensation Committee with regard to executive compensation programs.\nWe based the above conclusions on the following: for the annual long-term (equity-based) compensation programs in place in 2023 for our (i) executive\nofficers and (ii) corporate and field (non-executive) management, awards were subject to time-based vesting conditions, and the performance targets for\nthe performance-based awards were linked to overall corporate performance (adjusted EBITDA target, as modified upward or downward based on the\nCompany’s three-year relative TSR compared to a peer group of companies). For the annual short-term (cash bonus) compensation programs in place\nfor our (i) executive officers and (ii) corporate and field senior (non-executive) management in place in 2023, performance targets were linked to overall\ncorporate performance (adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth targets), quality of patient care and people/human capital goals (all performance goals are\ndefined more fully on pages 19 to 20 of this Amendment No. 1). For the annual short-term (cash bonus) compensation programs in place for our eligible\nfield operations leaders, performance targets were linked to multiple performance measures similar to our corporate plans, with reasonable caps and\nappropriate controls to establish targets and validate actual performance against the targets before payouts were made.\nFurther, our Chief People Officer or other members of the human resources team and/or company internal counsel, as appropriate, report to the full\nBoard on at least a quarterly basis on matters relating to employee compensation. In addition, our independent compensation consultant regularly\nreviews our executive compensation program for the purpose of identifying potential sources of risk and reports its findings to the Compensation\nCommittee.\nAgreements with our Executive Officers\nWe currently do not have any employment agreements in place with any of our executive officers.\n2024 Executive Compensation Decisions\nIn the first quarter of 2024, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, we implemented the following pay practices:\n• approved the 2024 short-term incentive (cash bonus) plan, with the following performance measures and weightings: adjusted EBITDA\n(55%); Growth (20%); and Quality (25%);\n• required an adjusted EBITDA “gate” of target level of performance for the remaining 2024 short-term incentive compensation (cash\nbonus) plan performance measures (growth/revenue and quality of patient care performance goals) to pay out above the target level;\n• awarded 2024 annual equity awards comprised solely of time-based RSUs on February 16, 2024, which will vest ratably over four years\nfrom the date of grant; and\n• increased the base salaries of our Named Executive Officers by 3%.\n27\n2023 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nThe following table sets forth information concerning total compensation for our Named Executive Officers for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNon-Equity\nStock Option Incentive Plan All Other\nAwards Awards Compensation Compensation Total\nName and Principal Position Year Salary ($) Bonus ($) ($)(1) ($)(1) ($)(2) ($) ($)\nPaul B.

See “Temporary Enhancement of Termination Payments Under Executive\nSeverance Plan During 2023” on page 25 for additional information.\n39\nCEO Pay Ratio\nIn accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we determined the ratio of the annual total 2023 compensation of Mr. Ashworth and Mr. Kusserow,\nour CEOs, relative to the annual total 2023 compensation of our median employee. During 2023, Paul B. Kusserow served as our CEO from January 1\nto April 10, and Richard Ashworth served as our CEO from April 10 to December 31, 2023.\nWe identified a median employee as of December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Median Employee”) using the methodology described in our Definitive Proxy\nStatement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on April 27, 2022. SEC rules allow us to identify our median employee once every three years unless\nthere has been a change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant\nchange in our pay ratio disclosure. In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we concluded that there had been no change in our employee\npopulation or employee compensation arrangements that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure, such that, consistent with the SEC’s\nregulations, we could continue to use the 2021 Median Employee in calculating our CEO pay ratio for 2023. However, the 2021 Median Employee’s\nemployment with the Company terminated in 2022 and the Substitute Median Employee assigned in 2022 changed to a part time employee in 2023. In\naccordance with SEC rules and regulations, we have replaced the 2022 Median Employee with an employee in a similarly compensated position (the\n“2023 Substitute Median Employee”). Using the 2023 Substitute Median Employee, we estimated the annual total compensation for that employee by\napplying the same rules as used for determining total compensation for the Named Executive Officers as reported in Summary Compensation Table.\nMr. Kusserow’s annual total compensation for 2023 was $3,995,376 as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table on page 28. Mr. Ashworth’s\nannual total compensation for 2023 was $16,726,179. The sum of the annual total compensation for Mr. Kusserow and Mr. Ashworth is $20,721,55. The\n2023 annual total compensation for the 2023 Substitute Median Employee, calculated in the same manner, was estimated to be $57,359. Therefore, our\nCEO to median employee pay ratio for 2023 is approximately 361:1.\nDirector Compensation\nThe compensation structure for our non-employee directors in 2023 was as follows:\n• An annual cash retainer of $100,000;\n• An annual equity award of time-based RSUs with a value of $150,000 that vest one year after the date of grant conditioned on the\ndirector’s continued service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors through the vesting date; and\n• Reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable travel and lodging expenses, related to the director’s service on the\nBoard.\nIn addition to the other fees mentioned, the following table sets forth additional annual retainers for our Chairman, Lead Director and our Committee\nChairs:\nChairman of the Board Cash Retainer* $100,000\nLead Director Cash Retainer $ 30,000\nAudit Committee Chair Cash Retainer $ 25,000\nCompensation Committee Chair Cash Retainer $ 20,000\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair Cash Retainer $ 15,000\nQuality of Care Committee Chair Cash Retainer $ 15,000\nCompliance and Ethics Committee Chair Cash Retainer $ 15,000\n40\n* During the time periods in which Mr. Kusserow served as our Chief Executive Officer, he did not receive any additional compensation for his role as\nour Chairman. Mr. Kusserow did not receive the non-employee director annual equity award valued at $150,000 in 2023, as Mr. Kusserow received\nan equity award in January 2023 in connection with his service as Chief Executive Officer. Beginning May 18, 2023, Mr. Kusserow received the\nannual cash retainer of $100,000, pro rated for his service as a director while not also serving as our Chief Executive Officer, plus an additional\n$100,000 cash retainer for serving as our Chairman, pro rated for his service as our Chairman while not also serving as our Chief Executive Officer,\nand a one-time payment of $50,000 for transition services related to Contessa.\nOn May 3, 2023, each of Mses. Capps, Kline, Klapstein and Samuels, Drs. Coye and Rideout, and Mr. Perkins received an annual equity grant of RSUs\nvalued at $152,621. The number of RSUs granted (1,941) was determined by dividing the total grant value by the closing price of the Company’s\ncommon stock on May 2, 2023 ($77.26). The RSUs granted are subject to time-based vesting conditions and will vest 100% on May 3, 2024, predicated\nupon the respective director’s continued service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors through the vesting date.\nDirector compensation is approved on an annual basis by independent (non-employee) members of our Board of Directors.\nThe following table shows the value of all cash and equity-based compensation paid to the members of our Board of Directors during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nFees Earned or All Other\nPaid in Cash Stock Awards Compensation Total\nName(1) ($) ($)(2) ($) ($)\nVickie L.

Kusserow served as our Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 2023 until April 10, 2023 and as Chairman of our\nBoard of Directors the entire fiscal year. Because Mr. Kusserow was an employee of the Company at various times during 2023, he is not\nincluded in the table above. The compensation that Mr. Kusserow received as Chief Executive Officer and as Chairman of our Board of\nDirectors is included in the Summary Compensation Table.\n(2) The amounts shown in this column reflect the grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards granted to each of our directors.\nGenerally, the grant date fair value is the amount that we would expense in our financial statements over the vesting period of the award.\nAssumptions used in the calculation of this amount are included in Note 11 to our audited financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. As of December 31, 2023,\nMses. Capps, Klapstein, Kline and Samuels, Drs. Coye and Rideout, and Mr. Perkins each had 1,941 unvested restricted stock units, 100%\nof which will vest on May 3, 2024 assuming the director continues serving as a non-employee director through such date. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there were no fully vested outstanding stock options held by our non-employee directors.\nDirector Stock Ownership Guidelines\nIncluded in the Corporate Governance Guidelines adopted by our Board of Directors are stock ownership requirements applicable to our independent\ndirectors in order to more closely align their interests with those of our stockholders. Each non-employee (independent) director is required to own\nCompany shares with a fair market value equal to at least six times his or her base annual cash retainer.\n41\nEach non-employee director has five years from the date that they are elected or appointed (as applicable) to the position to come into compliance with\nthese ownership requirements.\nOnce a person subject to the stock ownership requirements accumulates shares with a value equal to the required multiple of annual retainer, he or she\nmust retain the minimum number of shares originally accumulated to meet the threshold requirement on a going-forward basis. If the Company’s stock\nprice subsequently declines after the stock ownership requirements are met, he or she will not be required to acquire additional shares. Each of our\nnon-employee directors was in compliance with the ownership requirements as of December 31, 2023, having acquired the required number of shares or\nhaving more time to do so.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nVickie L. Capps, Julie D. Klapstein, Teresa L. Kline, and Jeffrey A. Rideout, MD, served as members of the Compensation Committee in 2023. During\n2023:\n• none of our executive officers was a director of another entity where one of that entity’s executive officers served on the Compensation\nCommittee;\n• no member of the Compensation Committee was during the year or formerly an officer or employee of the Company or any of its\nsubsidiaries;\n• no member of the Compensation Committee entered into any transaction with our Company in which the amount involved exceeded\n$120,000;\n• none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee of any entity where one of that entity’s executive officers served on\nthe Compensation Committee; and\n• none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee of another entity where one of that entity’s executive officers served\nas a director on our Board of Directors.\nReport of the Compensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Amedisys, Inc. has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with\nmanagement, as required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K, and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to\nour Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Amendment No. 1.\nMembers of the Compensation Committee:\nTeresa L.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nRelated Party Transactions\nUnder our Code of Conduct, no director, officer or employee may have any business, financial, civic or professional interest outside the Company that in\nany way conflicts with that director’s, officer’s or employee’s ability to perform his or her duties at Amedisys with undivided loyalty. In addition, in\naccordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5630, which functions as our related party transaction policy, our Board of Directors reviews all “related\nparty transactions” for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis based upon whether such transactions are in the best interests of our\nCompany and our stockholders. For purposes of this review, a “related party transaction” is any transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404\nof SEC Regulation S-K. All related party transactions must be approved by a majority of our independent directors (any independent director who is a\nparty to a proposed related party transaction must recuse himself or herself from the vote). Our independent directors’ approval of any related party\ntransaction is reflected in the minutes of the meeting of our Board of Directors during which such approval was granted.\nThere were no transactions between the Company and any officer, director, any security holder listed in the “Stock Ownership Table” on page 43 of this\nAmendment No. 1, or any affiliate of or person related to any of them, since January 1, 2023, of the type or amount required to be disclosed pursuant to\nItem 404 of Regulation S-K. Additionally, none of our directors, executive officers or affiliates is a party to any proceedings adverse to us or any of our\nsubsidiaries or has a material interest adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries.\nDirector Independence\nOur Board of Directors has reviewed and analyzed the independence of each director. The purpose of the review was to determine whether any\nparticular relationships or transactions involving directors or their affiliates or immediate family members were inconsistent with a determination that\nthe director is independent for purposes of serving on the Board of Directors and its committees. During this review, the Board of Directors examined\nwhether there were any transactions and/or relationships between directors or their affiliates or immediate family members and the Company and the\nsubstance of any such transactions or relationships.\nFollowing this review, our Board of Directors determined that all directors who served during 2023, other than Messrs. Ashworth and Kusserow, are\n“independent” under the director independence requirements and listing standards of The NASDAQ Global Select Market. Mr. Ashworth is not\nconsidered independent because he is an executive officer of the Company. Mr. Kusserow is not considered independent because he served as an\nexecutive officer of the Company within the past three years.\nThe independent directors, as a group, meet in executive session on a regular basis (and at least once, quarterly) in connection with each Board meeting\nwithout any members of our management or non-independent directors present. Ms. Klapstein currently presides over these executive sessions as Lead\nDirector.\n45\nItem 14.

These forward-looking statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those described therein. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: disruption from the\nproposed merger with UnitedHealth Group with patient, payor, provider, referral source, supplier or management and employee relationships; the occurrence\nof any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement with UnitedHealth Group or the inability to\ncomplete the proposed transaction on the anticipated terms and timetable; the risk that necessary regulatory approvals for the proposed merger with\nUnitedHealth Group are delayed, are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the failure of the conditions to the proposed\nmerger to be satisfied; the costs related to the proposed merger; the diversion of management time on merger-related issues; the risk that termination fees may\nbe payable by the Company in the event that the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances; reputational risk related to the proposed\nmerger; the risk of litigation or regulatory action related to the proposed merger; changes in Medicare and other medical payment levels; changes in payments\nand covered services by federal and state governments; future cost containment initiatives undertaken by third-party payors; changes in the episodic versus\nnon-episodic mix of our payors, the case mix of our patients and payment methodologies; staffing shortages driven by the competitive labor market; our ability\nto attract and retain qualified personnel; competition in the healthcare industry; our ability to maintain or establish new patient referral sources; changes in or\nour failure to comply with existing federal and state laws or regulations or the inability to comply with new government regulations on a timely basis; changes\nin estimates and judgments associated with critical accounting policies; our ability to consistently provide high-quality care; our ability to keep our patients\nand employees safe; our access to financing; our ability to meet debt service requirements and comply with covenants in debt agreements; business disruptions\ndue to natural or man-made disasters, climate change or acts of terrorism, widespread protests or civil unrest; our ability to open care centers, acquire\nadditional care centers and integrate and operate these care centers effectively; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, investments and\njoint ventures; our ability to integrate, manage and keep our information systems secure; the impact of inflation; and changes in laws or developments with\nrespect to any litigation relating to the Company, including various other matters, many of which are beyond our control.\nBecause forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, you should not rely on\nany forward-looking statement as a prediction of future events. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking, and we do not intend to release publicly\nany updates or changes in our expectations concerning the forward-looking statements or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances upon which any\nforward-looking statement may be based, except as required by law.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS, CONSOLIDATION AND PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAmedisys, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, referred to herein as “Amedisys,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), is a multi-state\nprovider of home health, hospice and high acuity care services with approximately 70% of our consolidated net service revenue derived from Medicare for the\nthree and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 73% of our consolidated net service revenue derived from Medicare for the three\nand nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we owned and operated 346 Medicare-certified home health care centers, 164\nMedicare-certified hospice care centers and 9 admitting high acuity care joint ventures in 37 states within the United States and the District of Columbia. We\ndivested our personal care business on March 31, 2023.\nAmedisys and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated Merger\nOn June 26, 2023, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (\"UnitedHealth Group\"), and Aurora Holdings Merger Sub Inc., a\nDelaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (\"Merger Sub\"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, pursuant to\nwhich Merger Sub will merge with and into Amedisys with Amedisys continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of\nUnitedHealth Group. See Note 4 - Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation\nIn our opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring\nadjustments) necessary to present fairly our financial position, our results of operations and our cash flows in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial reporting. Our results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative\nof the results of our operations for the entire year and have not been audited by our independent auditors.\nThis report should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 22, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”), which includes\ninformation and disclosures not included herein. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial information presented, as allowed by SEC rules and regulations.\nUse of Estimates\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. GAAP. In preparing the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we are required to\nmake estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amedisys, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and business\ncombinations accounted for as purchases have been included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. In\naddition to our wholly owned subsidiaries, we also have certain equity investments that we either consolidate, account for under the equity method of\naccounting or account for under the cost method of accounting. See Note 3 - Investments for additional information.\n7\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for service revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers, and as such, we recognize service revenue in the period in which we satisfy our performance obligations under our contracts by transferring\nour promised services to our customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for providing patient care, which\nare the transaction prices allocated to the distinct services. Our cost of obtaining contracts is not material.\nRevenues are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied, which varies based on the nature of the services provided. Our performance obligation is the\ndelivery of patient care services in accordance with the nature and frequency of services outlined in physicians' orders, which are determined by a physician\nbased on a patient's specific goals.\nOur performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year; therefore, we have elected to apply the optional exemption provided by\nASC 606 and are not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially\nunsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations are generally completed when the patients are\ndischarged, which generally occurs within days or weeks of the end of the reporting period.\nWe determine the transaction price based on gross charges for services provided, reduced by estimates for contractual and non-contractual revenue adjustments.\nContractual revenue adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contracted rates to be realized from patients, third-party\npayors and others for services provided. Non-contractual revenue adjustments include discounts provided to self-pay, uninsured patients or other payors,\nadjustments resulting from audits and payment reviews and adjustments arising from our inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation, authorizations\nor face-to-face documentation. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are recorded as adjustments to net service revenue in the period of\nchange.\nNon-contractual revenue adjustments are recorded for self-pay, uninsured patients and other payors by major payor class based on our historical collection\nexperience, aged accounts receivable by payor and current industry conditions. The non-contractual revenue adjustments represent the difference between\namounts billed and amounts we expect to collect based on our collection history with similar payors. We assess our ability to collect for the healthcare services\nprovided at the time of patient admission based on our verification of the patient's insurance coverage under Medicare, Medicaid and other commercial or\nmanaged care insurance programs.\nAmounts due from third-party payors, primarily commercial health insurers and government programs (Medicare and Medicaid), include variable\nconsideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due to settlements of audits and payment reviews. We determine our estimates for non-contractual revenue\nadjustments related to audits and payment reviews based on our historical experience and success rates in the claim appeals and adjudication process.\nWe determine our estimates for non-contractual revenue adjustments related to our inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation, authorizations or face-\nto-face documentation based on our historical collection experience.\n8\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNet service revenue by payor class as a percentage of total net service revenue for each of our operating segments, which are described in Note 8 - Segment\nInformation, is as follows:\nFor the Three-Month Periods Ended For the Nine-Month Periods\nSeptember 30, Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nHome Health:\nMedicare 36 % 39 % 37 % 39 %\nNon-Medicare - Episodic-based 8 % 7 % 8 % 8 %\nNon-Medicare - Non-episodic based 19 % 17 % 19 % 15 %\nHospice:\nMedicare 34 % 34 % 33 % 34 %\nNon-Medicare 2 % 2 % 2 % 2 %\nPersonal Care (1) — % — % — % 1 %\nHigh Acuity Care 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 %\n100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %\n(1) We divested our personal care business on March 31, 2023.\nHome Health Revenue Recognition\nMedicare Revenue\nAll Medicare contracts are required to have a signed plan of care which represents a single performance obligation, comprised of the delivery of a series of\ndistinct services that are substantially similar and have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. Accordingly, we account for the series of services\n(\"episode\") as a single performance obligation satisfied over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the goods and services\nprovided. An episode starts the first day a billable visit is performed and ends 60 days later or upon discharge, if earlier, with multiple continuous episodes\nallowed. Each 60-day episode includes two 30-day periods of care.\nNet service revenue is recorded based on the established Federal Medicare home health payment rate for a 30-day period of care. ASC 606 notes that if an\nentity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the entity’s performance completed to date, the\nentity may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. We have elected to apply the \"right to invoice\" practical expedient, and\ntherefore, our revenue recognition is based on the reimbursement we are entitled to for each 30-day period of care. We utilize our historical average length of\nstay for each 30-day period of care as the measure of progress towards the satisfaction of our performance obligation.\nThe Patient-Driven Groupings Model (\"PDGM\") uses timing, admission source, functional impairment levels and principal and other diagnoses to case-mix\nadjust payments. The case-mix adjusted payment for a 30-day period of care is subject to additional adjustments based on certain variables, including, but not\nlimited to (a) an outlier payment if our patient's care was unusually costly (capped at 10% of total reimbursement per provider number); (b) a low utilization\npayment adjustment (“LUPA”) if the number of visits provided was less than the established threshold, which ranges from two to six visits and varies for every\ncase-mix group; (c) a partial payment if a patient is transferred to another provider or from another provider before completing the 30-day period of care; and\n(d) the applicable geographic wage index. Payments for routine and non-routine supplies are included in the 30-day payment rate.\nMedicare can also make various adjustments to payments received if we are unable to produce appropriate billing documentation or acceptable authorizations.\nWe estimate the impact of such adjustments based on our historical collection experience, which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over 99% on\nMedicare claims, and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered to revenue with a corresponding reduction to patient accounts\nreceivable.\nAmounts due from Medicare include variable consideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due to settlements of audits and payment reviews. We\ndetermine our estimates for non-contractual revenue adjustments related to audits and payment reviews based on our historical experience and success rates in\nthe claim appeals and adjudication process.\n9\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nThe Medicare home health benefit requires that beneficiaries be homebound (meaning that the beneficiary is unable to leave his/her home without a\nconsiderable and taxing effort), require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech therapy services and receive treatment under a plan of care\nestablished and periodically reviewed by a physician.\nThe notice of admission (\"NOA\") process implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") requires a one-time submission for each\npatient that establishes the home health period of care and covers all contiguous 30-day periods of care until the patient is discharged from home health\nservices. If the NOA is not submitted timely, a payment reduction is applied equal to 1/30 of the 30-day payment rate for each day from the start of care date\nuntil the date the NOA is submitted.\nNon-Medicare Revenue\nPayments from non-Medicare payors are either a percentage of Medicare rates, per-visit rates or case rates depending upon the terms and conditions established\nwith such payors. Approximately 30% of our managed care contract volume affords us the opportunity to receive additional payments if we achieve certain\nquality or process metrics as defined in each contract (e.g. star ratings and acute-care hospitalization rates). We record revenue associated with these metrics at\nthe time the amounts are probable and estimable.\nEpisodic-based Revenue. We recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize Medicare revenue for amounts that are paid by other insurance carriers,\nincluding Medicare Advantage programs; however, these amounts can vary based upon the negotiated terms, the majority of which range from 90% to 100% of\nMedicare rates.\nNon-episodic based Revenue. For our per visit contracts, gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our\nestablished or estimated per-visit rates. For our case rate contracts, gross revenue is recorded over our historical average length of stay using the established\ncase rate for each admission. Contractual revenue adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contracted rates to be realized\nfrom patients, third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue. We also make non-\ncontractual revenue adjustments to non-episodic revenue based on our historical experience to reflect the estimated transaction price. We receive a minimal\namount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self-insured or are obligated for an insurance co-payment.\nUnder our case rate contracts, we may receive reimbursement before all services are rendered. Any cash received that exceeds the associated revenue earned is\nrecorded to deferred revenue in accrued expenses within our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nHospice Revenue Recognition\nHospice Medicare Revenue\nGross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates. The estimated payment rates are\npredetermined daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver. The four levels of care are routine care, general inpatient care, continuous\nhome care and respite care. Routine care accounted for 97% of our total Medicare hospice service revenue for the three and nine-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. There are two separate payment rates for routine care: payments for the first 60 days of care and care beyond 60 days. In\naddition to the two routine rates, we may also receive a service intensity add-on (“SIA”). The SIA is based on visits made in the last seven days of life by a\nregistered nurse or medical social worker for patients in a routine level of care.\nThe performance obligation is the delivery of hospice services to the patient, as determined by a physician, each day the patient is on hospice care.\nWe make adjustments to Medicare revenue for non-contractual revenue adjustments, which include our inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or\nacceptable authorizations and other reasons unrelated to credit risk. We estimate the impact of these non-contractual revenue adjustments based on our\nhistorical collection experience, which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over 99% on Medicare claims, and record this estimate during the\nperiod in which services are rendered to revenue with a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable.\nAmounts due from Medicare include variable consideration for retroactive revenue adjustments due to settlements of audits and payment reviews. We\ndetermine our estimates for non-contractual revenue adjustments related to audits and payment reviews based on our historical experience and success rates in\nthe claim appeals and adjudication process.\n10\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nAdditionally, our hospice service revenue is subject to certain limitations on payments from Medicare which are considered variable consideration. We are\nsubject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall Medicare payment cap for each provider number. We monitor these caps on a provider-by-provider basis and\nestimate amounts due back to Medicare if we estimate a cap has been exceeded. We record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and an increase in\naccrued expenses within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Providers are required to self-report and pay their estimated cap liability by February 28th\nof the following year. As of September 30, 2024, we had recorded $1.1 million for estimated amounts due back to Medicare in accrued expenses for the Federal\ncap years ended September 30, 2018 through September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had recorded $2.3 million for estimated amounts due back to\nMedicare in accrued expenses for the Federal cap years ended September 30, 2017 through September 30, 2024.\nHospice Non-Medicare Revenue\nGross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated per day rates, as applicable.\nContractual revenue adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contractual rates to be realized from patients, third-party\npayors and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine our net service revenue. We also make non-contractual adjustments\nto non-Medicare revenue based on our historical experience to reflect the estimated transaction price.\nPersonal Care Revenue Recognition\nPersonal Care Revenue\nFor the periods prior to the divestiture of our personal care line of business on March 31, 2023, we generated net service revenue by providing our services\ndirectly to patients based on authorized hours, visits or units determined by the relevant agency, at a rate that was either contractual or fixed by legislation. Net\nservice revenue was recognized at the time services were rendered based on gross charges for the services provided, reduced by estimates for contractual and\nnon-contractual revenue adjustments. We received payment for providing such services from payors, including state and local governmental agencies, managed\ncare organizations, commercial insurers and private consumers. Payors included the following elder service agencies: Aging Services Access Points\n(\"ASAPs\"), Senior Care Options (\"SCOs\"), Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (\"PACE\") and the Veterans Administration (\"VA\").\nHigh Acuity Care Revenue Recognition\nHigh Acuity Care Revenue\nOur revenues are primarily derived from contracts with health insurance plans for the coordination and provision of home recovery care services to clinically-\neligible patients who are enrolled members in those insurance plans, contracts with health system partners for the coordination and provision of home recovery\ncare services to clinically-eligible patients who are discharged early from a health system facility to complete their inpatient stay at home and contracts to\nprovide palliative care at home services to clinically-eligible patients.\nUnder our health insurance plan contracts, we provide home recovery care services, which include hospital-equivalent (\"H@H\") and skilled nursing facility\n(\"SNF\") equivalent services (\"SNF@H\"), for high acuity care patients on a full risk basis whereby we assume the financial risk for the coordination and\npayment of all hospital or SNF replacement medical services necessary to treat the medical condition for which the patient was diagnosed in a home-based\nsetting for a 30-day (H@H) or 60-day (SNF@H) episode of care in exchange for a fixed contracted bundled rate. For H@H programs, the fixed rate is based\non the assigned diagnosis related group (\"DRG\") and the 30-day post-discharge related spend. For SNF@H programs, the fixed rate is based on the 60-day\npost-discharge related spend. Our performance obligation is the coordination and provision of patient care in accordance with physicians’ orders over either a\n30-day or 60-day episode of care. The majority of our care coordination services and direct patient care is provided in the first five to seven days of the episode\nperiod (the \"acute phase\"). Monitoring services and follow-up direct patient care, as deemed necessary by the treating physician, are provided throughout the\nremainder of the episode. Since the majority of our services are provided during the acute phase, we recognize net service revenue over the acute phase based\non gross charges for the services provided per the applicable managed care contract rates, reduced by estimates for revenue adjustments.\nUnder our contracts with health system partners, we provide home recovery care services for high acuity patients on a limited risk basis whereby we assume\nthe risk for certain healthcare services during the remainder of an inpatient acute stay serviced at the patient’s home (completing H@H - \"CH@H\") in exchange\nfor a contracted per diem rate. The performance obligation is the\n11\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\ncoordination and provision of required medical services, as determined by the treating physician, for each day the patient receives inpatient-equivalent care at\nhome. As such, net service revenue is recognized as services are administered and as our performance obligations are satisfied on a per diem basis, reduced by\nestimates for revenue adjustments.\nWe recognize adjustments to revenue during the period in which changes to estimates of assigned patient diagnoses or episode terminations become known, in\naccordance with the applicable managed care contracts. For certain health insurance plans, revenue is reduced by amounts owed by enrollees to healthcare\nproviders under deductible, coinsurance or copay provisions of health insurance plan policies, since those amounts are repaid to the health insurance plans by\nus as part of a retrospective reconciliation process.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include money market funds, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of three months or less\nwhen purchased. The Company maintains cash with commercial banks, which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). At various\ntimes, the Company has deposits in these financial institutions in excess of the amount insured by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses\nrelated to these balances and believes its credit risk to be minimal. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values, which\nare primarily based on Level 1 inputs.\nRestricted cash includes cash that is not available for ordinary business use. As of December 31, 2023, we had $12.4 million classified as restricted cash related\nto funds placed into escrow accounts in connection with the indemnity, closing payment and other provisions within the purchase agreements of our Evolution\nHealth LLC acquisition and our personal care line of business divestiture. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, all funds held in escrow related\nto the personal care line of business divestiture were released to Amedisys. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, all funds held in escrow\nrelated to the Evolution Health LLC acquisition were released either to third parties or to Amedisys.\nThe following table summarizes the balances related to our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (amounts in millions):\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 245.5 $ 126.5\nRestricted cash — 12.4\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 245.5 $ 138.9\nPatient Accounts Receivable\nWe report accounts receivable from services rendered at their estimated transaction price, which includes contractual and non-contractual revenue adjustments\nbased on the amounts expected to be due from payors. Our patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and consist of amounts due from Medicare,\nMedicaid, other third-party payors and patients. Our non-Medicare third-party payor base is comprised of a diverse group of payors that are geographically\ndispersed across the country. As of September 30, 2024, there is one payor, other than Medicare, that accounts for more than 10% of our total outstanding\npatient receivables (approximately 11%). Thus, we believe there are no other significant concentrations of receivables that would subject us to any significant\ncredit risk in the collection of our patient accounts receivable. We write off accounts on a monthly basis once we have exhausted our collection efforts and\ndeem an account to be uncollectible. We believe the collectability risk associated with our Medicare accounts, which represented 54% and 69% of our patient\naccounts receivable at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is limited due to our historical collection rate of over 99% from Medicare and\nthe fact that Medicare is a U.S. government payor.\nWe do not believe there are any significant concentrations of revenues from any payor that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of\nour accounts receivable.\nPrior to February 2024, the Company exclusively utilized Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to submit patient claims to Medicare and all\nother payors for reimbursement. On February 22, 2024, UnitedHealth Group announced that on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare’s information\ntechnology systems were impacted by a cybersecurity incident. The Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident did not impact our day-to-day operations;\nhowever, we were delayed in submitting patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors which resulted in a reduction in our operating cash flow and an increase\nin our accounts receivable during the first and second quarters. There was minimal impact to our Medicare claim submissions as we were able to quickly\nredirect our Medicare claims to an alternative clearinghouse. As of September 30, 2024, we have resolved\n12\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nthe build up in accounts receivable resulting from the Change Healthcare outage, and we are continuing to utilize an additional clearinghouse to submit patient\nclaims for reimbursement.\nMedicare Home Health\nFor our home health patients, our pre-billing process includes verifying that we are eligible for payment from Medicare for the services that we provide to our\npatients. Our Medicare billing begins with a process to ensure that our billings are accurate through the utilization of an electronic Medicare claim review. We\nbill Medicare following the end of each 30-day period of care or upon discharge, if earlier, for the services provided to the patient.\nMedicare Hospice\nFor our hospice patients, our pre-billing process includes verifying that we are eligible for payment from Medicare for the services that we provide to our\npatients. Our Medicare billing begins with a process to ensure that our billings are accurate through the utilization of an electronic Medicare claim review. We\nbill Medicare on a monthly basis for the services provided to the patient.\nNon-Medicare Home Health, Hospice and High Acuity Care\nFor our non-Medicare patients, our pre-billing process primarily begins with verifying a patient’s eligibility for services with the applicable payor. Once the\npatient has been confirmed for eligibility, we will provide services to the patient and bill the applicable payor. Our review and evaluation of non-Medicare\naccounts receivable includes a detailed review of outstanding balances and special consideration to concentrations of receivables from particular payors or\ngroups of payors with similar characteristics that would subject us to any significant credit risk.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. Acquisitions are accounted for as\npurchases and are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. Assets acquired, liabilities assumed and\nnoncontrolling interests, if any, are measured at fair value on the acquisition date using the appropriate valuation method. Goodwill generated from acquisitions\nis recognized for the excess of the purchase price over tangible and identifiable intangible assets. In determining the fair value of identifiable intangible assets\nand any noncontrolling interests, we use various valuation techniques including the income approach, the cost approach and the market approach. These\nvaluation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions surrounding projected revenues and costs, growth rates and discount rates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following details our financial instruments where the carrying value and the fair value differ (amounts in millions):\nFair Value at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices in Active\nMarkets for Identical Significant Other Significant\nCarrying Value as of Items Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nFinancial Instrument September 30, 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n$450.0 million Term Loan $ 355.0 $ — $ 348.1 $ —\n13\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nThe fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to\nmeasure fair value. The three levels of inputs are as follows:\n• Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n• Level 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices\nin markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the\nassets or liabilities.\n• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nOur deferred compensation plan assets are recorded at fair value and are considered a level 2 measurement. For our other financial instruments, including our\ncash and cash equivalents, patient accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll and employee benefits and accrued expenses, we estimate the carrying\namounts approximate fair value.\nWeighted-Average Shares Outstanding\nNet income (loss) per share attributable to Amedisys, Inc. common stockholders, calculated on the treasury stock method, is based on the weighted average\nnumber of shares outstanding during the period. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, shares used in our computation of weighted-average\nshares outstanding, which are used to calculate our basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to Amedisys, Inc. common stockholders (amounts in\nthousands):\nFor the Three- For the Nine-\nMonth Periods Month Periods\nEnded September 30, Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding - basic 32,745 32,624 32,707 32,587\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options 12 10 10 —\nNon-vested stock and stock units 378 197 303 —\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding - diluted 33,135 32,831 33,020 32,587\nAnti-dilutive securities 191 248 434 652\n3. INVESTMENTS\nWe consolidate investments when the entity is a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") and we are the primary beneficiary or if we have controlling interests in the\nentity, which is generally ownership in excess of 50%. Third-party equity interests in our consolidated joint ventures are reflected as noncontrolling interests in\nour condensed consolidated financial statements.\nWe account for investments in entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50% or less of the\nvoting stock and the entity is not a VIE in which we are the primary beneficiary. The book value of investments that we account for under the equity method of\naccounting was $49.3 million and $46.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is reflected in other assets within our\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\nWe account for investments in entities in which we have less than 20% ownership interest under the cost method of accounting if we do not have the ability to\nexercise significant influence over the investee. The book value of investments that we account for under the cost method of accounting was $20.0 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and is reflected in other assets within our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n14\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nOur high acuity care segment includes interests in several joint ventures with health system partners and a professional corporation that employs clinicians.\nEach of these entities meets the criteria to be classified as a VIE. We have management agreements in place whereby we manage the entities and run the day-\nto-day operations. As such, we possess the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The significant\nactivities include, but are not limited to, negotiating provider and payor contracts, establishing patient care policies and protocols, making employment and\ncompensation decisions, developing the operating and capital budgets, performing marketing activities and providing accounting support. We also have the\nobligation to absorb any expected losses and the right to receive benefits. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to provide joint venture funding.\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we consolidated all but one of our joint ventures with health system partners as well as the\nprofessional corporation as we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs; the joint venture that is not consolidated is accounted for\nunder the equity method of accounting. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, we entered into an agreement to wind-down and dissolve the\noperations of the unconsolidated joint venture. We completed the wind-down during the third quarter.\nThe terms of the agreements with each VIE prohibit us from using the assets of the VIE to satisfy the obligations of other entities. The carrying amount of the\nVIEs’ assets and liabilities included in our condensed consolidated balance sheets are as follows (amounts in millions):\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 10.9 $ 8.8\nPatient accounts receivable 6.8 9.0\nOther current assets — 0.1\nTotal current assets 17.7 17.9\nProperty and equipment — 0.1\nOperating lease right of use assets 0.1 0.1\nGoodwill 8.5 8.5\nIntangible assets 0.4 0.4\nOther assets — 0.3\nTotal assets $ 26.7 $ 27.3\nLIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 0.6 $ 0.5\nPayroll and employee benefits 1.0 0.9\nAccrued expenses 9.7 7.9\nTotal liabilities $ 11.3 $ 9.3\n4. MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nMergers\nOn June 26, 2023, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (\"UnitedHealth Group\"), and Aurora Holdings Merger Sub Inc., a\nDelaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (\"Merger Sub\"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger\nAgreement\"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Amedisys with Amedisys continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly\nowned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (the “Merger”).\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the \"Effective Time\"), by virtue of the Merger: (i)\neach share of Amedisys common stock (“Amedisys Common Stock”) held in treasury by\n15\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nAmedisys or owned by UnitedHealth Group or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\ncancelled (collectively, “cancelled shares”) without consideration; and (ii) each share of Amedisys Common Stock, other than any cancelled shares, issued and\noutstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive $101 per share in cash, without interest, less any applicable\nwithholding taxes.\nThe Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement. These closing conditions include, among others, (i) approval\nby Amedisys stockholders at the Amedisys Stockholders Meeting (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which\napproval was obtained on September 8, 2023; (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the receipt of the required state regulatory approvals; (iv) the absence of any law or order\nthat has the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the Merger; and (v) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any\nextension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement under all applicable antitrust laws without the\nimposition by any governmental entity of any term, condition, obligation, requirement, limitation, prohibition, remedy, sanction or other action that has resulted\nin or would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement).\nOn June 28, 2024, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group and certain of their respective subsidiaries entered into an agreement relating to the sale of certain Amedisys\nhome health care centers and certain UnitedHealth Group care centers to VCG Luna, LLC, an affiliate of VitalCaring Group (the \"Divestiture\"). Consummation\nof the Divestiture is contingent on a number of conditions, including the consummation of the Merger, which itself is subject to a number of conditions,\nincluding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Amedisys and\nUnitedHealth Group continue to work cooperatively with the United States Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") staff in their review of the Merger, but Amedisys\ncannot be certain as to when the DOJ's review will be completed or the outcome of that review.\nTermination of Option Care Health, Inc. (\"OPCH\") Merger Agreement\nAs previously disclosed in Amedisys’ Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2023 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the\nSEC on May 4, 2023, Amedisys entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger on May 3, 2023 (the “OPCH Merger Agreement”) with OPCH, a Delaware\ncorporation, and Uintah Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of OPCH (“OPCH Merger Sub”). On June 26, 2023,\nAmedisys, OPCH and OPCH Merger Sub entered into the Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties thereto agreed\nto terminate the OPCH Merger Agreement and grant mutual releases by the parties of all claims against the other parties based upon, arising from, in\nconnection with or relating to the OPCH Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, each of the termination of the OPCH Merger\nAgreement and the mutual releases provided for in the Termination Agreement would become effective upon receipt by OPCH of a $106,000,000 termination\nfee payable by, or on behalf of, Amedisys within 24 hours of the execution of the Termination Agreement (i.e., before the market open on June 27, 2023). On\nJune 26, 2023, following the execution of the Termination Agreement, UnitedHealth Group, on behalf of Amedisys, delivered funds to OPCH in an amount\nequal to $106,000,000, representing the termination fee payable to OPCH under the OPCH Merger Agreement and the Termination Agreement, satisfying the\ncondition precedent to the effectiveness of the termination of the OPCH Merger Agreement and the releases contained in the Termination Agreement. If the\nMerger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, Amedisys may be required to reimburse UnitedHealth Group for the $106,000,000\ntermination fee that UnitedHealth Group, on Amedisys’ behalf, paid to OPCH in addition to the $125,000,000 termination fee payable by Amedisys to\nUnitedHealth Group upon termination of the Merger Agreement. The $106,000,000 termination fee was recorded to other income (expense) within our\ncondensed consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding liability to termination fee paid by UnitedHealth Group within our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet during the three-month period ended June 30, 2023.\nAcquisitions\nWe complete acquisitions from time to time in order to pursue our strategy of increasing our market presence by expanding our service base and enhancing our\nposition in certain geographic areas as a leading provider of home health, hospice and high acuity care services. The purchase price paid for acquisitions is\nnegotiated through arm’s length transactions, with consideration based on our analysis of, among other things, comparable acquisitions and expected cash\nflows. Acquisitions are accounted for as purchases and are included in our condensed consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates.\nGoodwill generated from acquisitions is recognized for the excess of the purchase price over tangible and identifiable intangible assets because of the expected\ncontributions of the acquisitions to our overall corporate strategy. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of\nidentifiable intangible assets for significant acquisitions. The\n16\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\npreliminary purchase price allocation is adjusted, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date if management obtains more information\nregarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.\nDispositions\nOn February 10, 2023, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our personal care business (excluding the Florida operations, which were closed during the\nthree-month period ended March 31, 2023). The divestiture closed on March 31, 2023. We received net proceeds of $47.8 million and recognized a\n$2.2 million loss during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, which is reflected in miscellaneous, net within our condensed consolidated statement of\noperations. The net proceeds of $47.8 million is inclusive of $6.0 million that was placed into an escrow account in accordance with the closing payment and\nindemnity provisions within the purchase agreement.\nOf the total $6.0 million placed into escrow, $1.0 million was set aside for the closing payment adjustment. The closing payment calculated on the acquisition\ndate included estimates for cash, working capital and various other items. Under the purchase agreement, the purchase price was subject to an adjustment for\nany differences between estimated amounts included in the closing payment and actual amounts at close. The closing payment adjustment was finalized during\n2023 with $0.1 million being paid to Amedisys by the buyer. The $1.0 million in escrow related to the closing payment adjustment was released to Amedisys\nduring 2023. The remaining $5.0 million placed into escrow, which was related to indemnity provisions within the purchase agreement, was released to\nAmedisys during the second quarter of 2024.\nThe disposition of our personal care business did not qualify as a discontinued operation because it did not represent a change in strategy that has or will have a\nmajor effect on the Company's operations or financial results.\nWe derecognized goodwill of $43.1 million in connection with the divestiture.\n5. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS\nLong-term debt consists of the following for the periods indicated (amounts in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n$450.0 million Term Loan; interest rate at Base Rate plus Applicable Rate or Term SOFR plus\nApplicable Rate (6.4% at September 30, 2024); due July 30, 2026 $ 355.0 $ 371.9\n$550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility; interest only payments; interest rate at Base Rate plus\nApplicable Rate or Term SOFR plus Applicable Rate; due July 30, 2026 — —\nFinance leases 28.7 28.9\nPrincipal amount of long-term obligations 383.7 400.8\nDeferred debt issuance costs (1.8) (2.6)\n381.9 398.2\nCurrent portion of long-term obligations (37.5) (36.3)\nLong-term obligations, less current portion $ 344.4 $ 361.9\nThird Amendment to the Credit Agreement\nOur Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion, which includes a $550.0 million\nRevolving Credit Facility and a term loan facility with a principal amount of up to $450.0 million (the \"Amended Term Loan Facility\" and collectively with the\nRevolving Credit Facility, the \"Amended Credit Facility\"). On March 10, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement (as amended by\nthe Third Amendment, the \"Third Amended Credit Agreement\") which (i) formally replaced the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") with the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") for interest rate pricing and (ii) allowed for the disposition of our personal care business.\nThe loans issued under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest on a per annum basis, at our election, at either: (i) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate or\n(ii) the Term SOFR plus the Applicable Rate. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%\nper annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Term SOFR plus 1% per annum. The “Term SOFR” means the\nquoted rate per annum equal to the SOFR for an interest period of one or three months (as selected by us) plus the SOFR adjustment of 0.10%. The\n17\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n“Applicable Rate” is based on the consolidated leverage ratio and is presented in the table below. As of September 30, 2024, the Applicable Rate is 0.50% per\nannum for Base Rate loans and 1.50% per annum for Term SOFR loans. We are also subject to a commitment fee and letter of credit fee under the terms of the\nThird Amended Credit Agreement, as presented in the table below.\nTerm SOFR Loans and SOFR\nPricing Tier Consolidated Leverage Ratio Base Rate Loans Daily Floating Rate Loans Commitment Fee Letter of Credit Fee\nI > 3.00 to 1.0 1.00% 2.00% 0.30% 1.75%\nII < 3.00 to 1.0 but > 2.00 to 1.0 0.75% 1.75% 0.25% 1.50%\nIII < 2.00 to 1.0 but > 0.75 to 1.0 0.50% 1.50% 0.20% 1.25%\nIV < 0.75 to 1.0 0.25% 1.25% 0.15% 1.00%\nThe final maturity date of the Amended Credit Facility is July 30, 2026. The Revolving Credit Facility will terminate and be due and payable as of the final\nmaturity date. The Amended Term Loan Facility, however, is subject to quarterly amortization of principal in the amount of (i) 0.625% for the period\ncommencing on July 30, 2021 and ending on September 30, 2023, and (ii) 1.250% for the period commencing on October 1, 2023 and ending on July 30, 2026.\nThe remaining balance of the Amended Term Loan Facility must be paid upon the final maturity date. In addition to the scheduled amortization of the\nAmended Term Loan Facility, and subject to customary exceptions and reinvestment rights, we are required to prepay the Amended Term Loan Facility first\nand the Revolving Credit Facility second with 100% of all net cash proceeds received by any loan party or any subsidiary thereof in connection with (a) any\nasset sale or disposition where such loan party receives net cash proceeds in excess of $5 million or (b) any debt issuance that is not permitted under the Third\nAmended Credit Agreement.\nIn accordance with the requirements above, net proceeds received from the divestiture of our personal care line of business were used to prepay a portion of our\nAmended Term Loan Facility during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023.\nThe Third Amended Credit Agreement requires maintenance of two financial covenants: (i) a consolidated leverage ratio of funded indebtedness to Earnings\nBefore Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as defined in the Third Amended Credit Agreement, and (ii) a consolidated interest\ncoverage ratio of EBITDA to cash interest charges, as defined in the Third Amended Credit Agreement. Each of these covenants is calculated over rolling four-\nquarter periods and also is subject to certain exceptions and baskets. The Third Amended Credit Agreement also contains customary covenants, including, but\nnot limited to, restrictions on: incurrence of liens, incurrence of additional debt, sales of assets and other fundamental corporate changes, investments and\ndeclarations of dividends. These covenants contain customary exclusions and baskets as detailed in the Third Amended Credit Agreement. As of September 30,\n2024, we are in compliance with our covenants under the Third Amended Credit Agreement.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Third Amended Credit Agreement\nrequires at all times that we (i) provide guarantees from wholly-owned subsidiaries that in the aggregate represent not less than 95% of our consolidated net\nrevenues and adjusted EBITDA from all wholly-owned subsidiaries and (ii) provide guarantees from subsidiaries that in the aggregate represent not less than\n70% of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, subject to certain exceptions.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Our weighted average interest rate\nfor borrowings under our Amended Term Loan Facility was 7.2% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 7.1% and 6.6% for the\nthree and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our availability under our $550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility was $511.2 million as we have no outstanding borrowings and\n$38.8 million outstanding in letters of credit.\n18\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nJoinder Agreements\nIn connection with the Compassionate Care Hospice (\"CCH\") acquisition, we entered into a Joinder Agreement, dated as of February 4, 2019 (the “CCH\nJoinder”), pursuant to which CCH and its subsidiaries were made parties to, and became subject to the terms and conditions of, the Amended Credit Agreement\n(now the Third Amended Credit Agreement), the Amended and Restated Security Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2018 (the “Amended and Restated Security\nAgreement”), and the Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2018 (the “Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement”). In connection\nwith the AseraCare acquisition, we entered into a Joinder Agreement, dated as of June 12, 2020, pursuant to which the AseraCare entities were made parties to,\nand became subject to the terms and conditions of, the Amended Credit Agreement (now the Third Amended Credit Agreement), the Amended and Restated\nSecurity Agreement and the Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (the “AseraCare Joinder\"). In connection with the Contessa acquisition, we entered into\na Joinder Agreement, dated as of September 3, 2021, pursuant to which Contessa and its subsidiaries and Asana Hospice (\"Asana\"), which we acquired on\nJanuary 1, 2020, and its subsidiaries were made parties to, and became subject to the terms and conditions of, the Second Amended Credit Agreement (now the\nThird Amended Credit Agreement), the Amended and Restated Security Agreement and the Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (the “Contessa and\nAsana Joinder,” and together with the CCH Joinder and the AseraCare Joinder, the “Joinders”).\nPursuant to the Joinders, the Amended and Restated Security Agreement and the Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement, CCH and its subsidiaries, the\nAseraCare entities, Contessa and its subsidiaries and Asana and its subsidiaries granted in favor of the Administrative Agent a first lien security interest in\nsubstantially all of their personal property assets and pledged to the Administrative Agent each of their respective subsidiaries' issued and outstanding equity\ninterests. CCH and its subsidiaries, the AseraCare entities, Contessa and its subsidiaries and Asana and its subsidiaries also guaranteed our obligations, whether\nnow existing or arising after the respective effective dates of the Joinders, under the Third Amended Credit Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Joinders and\nthe Third Amended Credit Agreement.\nFinance Leases\nOur outstanding finance leases totaling $28.7 million relate to leased equipment and fleet vehicles and bear interest rates ranging from 3.2% to 8.1%.\n6. INCOME TAXES\nWe use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using\ncurrently enacted tax rates. Our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about future operations. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a\nvaluation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect of a change in\ntax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.\nManagement regularly assesses the ability to realize deferred tax assets based upon the weight of available evidence, including such factors as recent earnings\nhistory and expected future taxable income. In the event future taxable income is below management’s estimates or is generated in tax jurisdictions different\nthan projected, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax rate.\nThe recognition of income taxes at interim periods is completed using an estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the period is influenced\nby the relationship of the amount of “effective tax rate drivers” (i.e. non-deductible expenses, non-taxable income, tax credits, valuation allowance, uncertain\ntax positions, etc.) to income or loss before taxes. For the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred merger related\nexpenses totaling $16.7 million and $49.2 million, respectively, which is a significant and unusual reduction to income before taxes and is inclusive of\n$13.3 million and $40.2 million, respectively, of “effective tax rate drivers.” Consequently, for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, the\nrelationship between the “effective tax rate drivers” and income before taxes is distorted, resulting in an unusual effective tax rate.\n19\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings - Ongoing\nWe are involved in legal actions in the normal course of business, some of which seek monetary damages, including claims for punitive damages. Based on\ninformation available to us as of the date of this filing, we do not believe that these normal course actions, when finally concluded and determined, will have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nLegal fees related to all legal matters are expensed as incurred.\nThird Party Audits - Ongoing\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to audits under various governmental programs in which third party firms engaged by\nCMS, including Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”), Zone Program Integrity Contractors (“ZPICs”), Uniform Program Integrity Contractors (“UPICs”),\nProgram Safeguard Contractors (“PSCs”), Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”), Supplemental Medical Review Contractors (“SMRCs”) and the Office of\nthe Inspector General (“OIG”), conduct extensive reviews of claims data to identify potential improper payments. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of\nany regulatory reviews or other governmental audits and investigations.\nIn July 2010, our subsidiary that provides hospice services in Florence, South Carolina received from a ZPIC a request for records regarding a sample of 30\nbeneficiaries who received services from the subsidiary during the period of January 1, 2008 through March 31, 2010 (the “Review Period”) to determine\nwhether the underlying services met pertinent Medicare payment requirements. We acquired the hospice operations subject to this review on August 1, 2009;\nthe Review Period covered time periods both before and after our ownership of these hospice operations. Based on the ZPIC’s findings for 16 beneficiaries,\nwhich were extrapolated to all claims for hospice services provided by the Florence subsidiary billed during the Review Period, on June 6, 2011, the Medicare\nAdministrative Contractor (“MAC”) for the subsidiary issued a notice of overpayment seeking recovery from our subsidiary of an alleged overpayment. We\ndisputed these findings, and our Florence subsidiary filed appeals through the Original Medicare Standard Appeals Process, in which we sought to have those\nfindings overturned. An administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") hearing was held in early January 2015. On January 18, 2016, we received a letter referencing the\nALJ hearing decision for the overpayment issued on June 6, 2011. The decision was partially favorable with a new overpayment amount of $3.7 million with a\nbalance owed of $5.6 million, including interest, based on 9 disputed claims (originally 16). We filed an appeal to the Medicare Appeals Council on the\nremaining 9 disputed claims and also argued that the statistical method used to select the sample was not valid. No assurances can be given as to the timing or\noutcome of the Medicare Appeals Council decision. As of September 30, 2024, Medicare has withheld payments of $5.7 million (including additional interest)\nas part of their standard procedures once this level of the appeal process has been reached. In the event we are not able to recoup this alleged overpayment, we\nare entitled to be indemnified by the prior owners of the hospice operations for amounts relating to the period prior to August 1, 2009. On January 10, 2019, an\narbitration panel from the American Health Lawyers Association determined that the prior owners' liability for their indemnification obligation was $2.8\nmillion. This amount is recorded as an indemnity receivable within other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nIn July 2016, the Company received a request for medical records from SafeGuard Services, L.L.C (“SafeGuard”), a ZPIC, related to services provided by\nsome of the care centers that the Company acquired from Infinity Home Care, L.L.C. The review period covered time periods both before and after our\nownership of the care centers, which were acquired on December 31, 2015. In August 2017, the Company received Requests for Repayment from Palmetto\nGBA, LLC (\"Palmetto\") regarding Infinity Home Care of Lakeland, LLC (\"Lakeland Care Centers\") and Infinity Home Care of Pinellas, LLC (\"Clearwater\nCare Center\"). The Palmetto letters were based on a statistical extrapolation performed by SafeGuard which alleged an overpayment of $34.0 million for the\nLakeland Care Centers on a universe of 72 Medicare claims totaling $0.2 million in actual claims payments and an overpayment of $4.8 million for the\nClearwater Care Center on a universe of 70 Medicare claims totaling $0.2 million in actual claims payments.\nAs a result of partially successful Level I and Level II Administrative Appeals, the alleged overpayment for the Lakeland Care Centers was reduced to $26.0\nmillion, and the alleged overpayment for the Clearwater Care Center was reduced to $3.3 million. The Company filed Level III Administrative Appeals, and the\nALJ hearings regarding the Lakeland Request for Repayment and the Clearwater Request for Repayment were held in April 2022. The Company received the\nresults of the ALJ hearings in June 2022. The ALJ decisions for both the Clearwater Care Center and the Lakeland Care Centers were partially favorable for the\nclaims that were reviewed, but the extrapolations were upheld. As a result, we increased our total accrual related to these\n20\nAMEDISYS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nmatters from $17.4 million to $25.2 million, excluding interest. The repayments for the Lakeland Care Centers totaling $34.3 million ($22.8 million\nextrapolated repayment plus $11.5 million accrued interest) and the Clearwater Care Center totaling $3.7 million ($2.4 million extrapolated repayment plus\n$1.2 million accrued interest) were made during the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, we wrote off $1.5 million of receivables that were impacted\nby these matters during the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect to be indemnified by the prior owners, upon exhaustion of the parties' appeal rights, for\napproximately $10.9 million and have recorded this amount within other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nInsurance\nWe are obligated for certain costs associated with our insurance programs, including employee health, workers’ compensation, professional liability and fleet.\nWhile we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks, we are self-insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims. We recognize our\nobligations associated with these costs, up to specified deductible limits in the period in which a claim is incurred, including with respect to both reported\nclaims and claims incurred but not reported. These costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience. Such estimates, and\nthe resulting reserves, are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis.\nOur health insurance has an exposure limit of $1.5 million for any individual covered life. Our workers’ compensation insurance has a retention limit of $2.0\nmillion per incident. Our professional liability insurance has a retention limit of $0.3 million per incident. Our fleet insurance has an exposure limit of\n$0.5 million per accident.\n8.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis provides information we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and\nfinancial condition for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein, and the consolidated financial statements and notes and the related Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed\nwith the SEC on February 22, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”). Historical results that appear in the condensed consolidated financial statements should not be\ninterpreted as being indicative of future operations.\nUnless otherwise provided, “Amedisys,” “we,” “our,” and “the Company” refer to Amedisys, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe are a provider of high-quality in-home healthcare and related services to the chronic, co-morbid, aging American population with approximately 70% of\nour consolidated net service revenue derived from Medicare for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 73% of our\nconsolidated net service revenue derived from Medicare for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023.\nOur operations involve servicing patients through our three reportable business segments: home health, hospice and high acuity care. We divested our personal\ncare business on March 31, 2023. Our home health segment delivers a wide range of services in the homes of individuals who may be recovering from an\nillness, injury or surgery. Our hospice segment provides care that is designed to provide comfort and support for those who are facing a terminal illness. Our\nhigh acuity care segment delivers the essential elements of inpatient hospital, palliative and skilled nursing facility (\"SNF\") care to patients in their homes. As\nof September 30, 2024, we owned and operated 346 Medicare-certified home health care centers, 164 Medicare-certified hospice care centers and 9 admitting\nhigh acuity care joint ventures in 37 states within the United States and the District of Columbia.\nCare Centers Summary (Includes Unconsolidated Joint Ventures)\nHome Personal\nHealth Hospice Care High Acuity Care\nAs of December 31, 2023 346 165 — 10\nAcquisitions/Startups/De Novos — — — —\nDivestitures/Closures/Consolidations — (1) — (1)\nAs of September 30, 2024 346 164 — 9\nProposed Merger\nOn June 26, 2023, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (\"UnitedHealth Group\"), and Aurora Holdings Merger Sub Inc., a\nDelaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (\"Merger Sub\"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger\nAgreement\"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Amedisys with Amedisys continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly\nowned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (the “Merger”).\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the \"Effective Time\"), by virtue of the Merger: (i)\neach share of Amedisys common stock (“Amedisys Common Stock”) held in treasury by Amedisys or owned by UnitedHealth Group or Merger Sub or any of\ntheir respective subsidiaries, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled (collectively, “cancelled shares”) without consideration;\nand (ii) each share of Amedisys Common Stock, other than any cancelled shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be\nconverted into the right to receive $101 per share in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes.\nThe Merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement. These closing conditions include, among others, (i) approval\nby Amedisys stockholders at the Amedisys Stockholders Meeting (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which\napproval was obtained on September 8, 2023; (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-\nScott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the receipt of the required state regulatory approvals; (iv) the absence of any law or order\nthat has the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the completion of the Merger; and (v) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any\nextension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the transactions contemplated\n24\nby the Merger Agreement under all applicable antitrust laws without the imposition by any governmental entity of any term, condition, obligation, requirement,\nlimitation, prohibition, remedy, sanction or other action that has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Burdensome Condition (as defined in\nthe Merger Agreement). Due to these conditions and other contingencies, there can be no assurance that the Merger will be successfully completed. During the\nperiods prior to and including the date of the closing of the Merger, we expect to incur significant additional merger-related expenses. See Item 1A - Risk\nFactors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, for a discussion of our risk\nfactors related to the proposed merger.\nOn June 28, 2024, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group and certain of their respective subsidiaries entered into an agreement relating to the sale of certain Amedisys\nhome health care centers and certain UnitedHealth Group care centers to VCG Luna, LLC, an affiliate of VitalCaring Group (the \"Divestiture\"). Consummation\nof the Divestiture is contingent on a number of conditions, including the consummation of the Merger, which itself is subject to a number of conditions,\nincluding the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Amedisys and\nUnitedHealth Group continue to work cooperatively with the United States Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") staff in their review of the Merger, but Amedisys\ncannot be certain as to when the DOJ's review will be completed or the outcome of that review.\nTermination of Option Care Health, Inc. (\"OPCH\") Merger Agreement\nAs previously disclosed in Amedisys' Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3, 2023 and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the\nSEC on May 4, 2023, Amedisys entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger on May 3, 2023 (the “OPCH Merger Agreement”) with OPCH, a Delaware\ncorporation, and Uintah Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of OPCH (“OPCH Merger Sub”). On June 26, 2023,\nAmedisys, OPCH and OPCH Merger Sub entered into the Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties thereto agreed\nto terminate the OPCH Merger Agreement and grant mutual releases by the parties of all claims against the other parties based upon, arising from, in\nconnection with or relating to the OPCH Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Termination Agreement, each of the termination of the OPCH Merger\nAgreement and the mutual releases provided for in the Termination Agreement would become effective upon receipt by OPCH of a $106,000,000 termination\nfee payable by, or on behalf of, Amedisys within 24 hours of the execution of the Termination Agreement (i.e., before the market open on June 27, 2023). On\nJune 26, 2023, following the execution of the Termination Agreement, UnitedHealth Group, on behalf of Amedisys, delivered funds to OPCH in an amount\nequal to $106,000,000, representing the termination fee payable to OPCH under the OPCH Merger Agreement and the Termination Agreement, satisfying the\ncondition precedent to the effectiveness of the termination of the OPCH Merger Agreement and the releases contained in the Termination Agreement. If the\nMerger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, Amedisys may be required to reimburse UnitedHealth Group for the $106,000,000\ntermination fee that UnitedHealth Group, on Amedisys’ behalf, paid to OPCH in addition to the $125,000,000 termination fee payable by Amedisys to\nUnitedHealth Group upon termination of the Merger Agreement. The $106,000,000 termination fee was recorded to other income (expense) within our\ncondensed consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding liability to termination fee paid by UnitedHealth Group within our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet during the three-month period ended June 30, 2023.\nPersonal Care Divestiture\nOn March 31, 2023, we sold our personal care business. We received net proceeds of $47.8 million and recognized a loss of $2.2 million in connection with the\ndivestiture during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") Payment Updates\nHospice\nOn July 28, 2023, CMS issued the final rule to update hospice payment rates and the wage index for fiscal year 2024, effective for services provided beginning\nOctober 1, 2023. CMS estimated hospices serving Medicare beneficiaries would see a 3.1% increase in payments. This increase was the result of a 3.3%\nmarket basket adjustment as required under the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act\n(\"PPACA\") less a 0.2% productivity adjustment. Additionally, CMS increased the aggregate cap amount by 3.1% to $33,494. Our company-specific impact\nwas in line with CMS' estimate.\nOn July 30, 2024, CMS issued the final rule to update hospice payment rates and the wage index for fiscal year 2025, effective for services provided beginning\nOctober 1, 2024. CMS estimates hospices serving Medicare beneficiaries will see a 2.9% increase in payments. This increase is the result of a 3.4% market\nbasket adjustment as required under PPACA less a 0.5% productivity adjustment. Additionally, CMS increased the aggregate cap amount by 2.9% to $34,465.\nBased on our analysis of the final rule, we expect our impact to be in line with the 2.9% increase.\n25\nHome Health\nOn November 1, 2023, CMS issued the Calendar Year (\"CY\") 2024 Final Rule for Medicare home health providers. CMS estimated that the final rule would\nresult in a 0.8% increase in payments to home health providers. This increase was the result of a 3.0% payment update (3.3% market basket adjustment less a\n0.3% productivity adjustment) and an increase of 0.4% for the update to the fixed-dollar loss ratio used in determining outlier payments offset by a permanent\nadjustment of -2.6% based on the difference between assumed and actual behavior changes resulting from the implementation of the Patient-Driven Groupings\nModel (\"PDGM\"). The -2.6% permanent adjustment was derived from a -2.890% adjustment which was only applied to the 30-day payment rate and not the\nlow utilization payment adjustment. The -2.890% adjustment was only half of the total proposed adjustment. The remaining adjustment was to be considered in\nfuture rulemaking. Our company-specific impact has been in line with CMS' estimate.\nIn addition to permanent adjustments, CMS also has discretion to make temporary adjustments through calendar year 2026. CMS elected not to implement a\ntemporary adjustment for calendar year 2024.\nOn November 1, 2024, CMS issued the CY 2025 Final Rule for Medicare home health providers. CMS estimates that the final rule will result in a 0.5%\nincrease in payments to home health providers. This increase is the result of a 2.7% payment update (3.2% market basket adjustment less a 0.5% productivity\nadjustment) offset by a decrease of 0.4% for the update to the fixed-dollar loss ratio used in determining outlier payments and a permanent adjustment of -1.8%\nbased on the difference between assumed and actual behavior changes resulting from the implementation of PDGM. Based on our analysis of the final rule, we\nexpect our impact to be in line with the 0.5% increase.\nResults of Operations\nThree-Month Period Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2023\nConsolidated\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations (amounts in millions):\nFor the Three-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet service revenue $ 587.7 $ 556.2\nCost of service, inclusive of depreciation 337.6 311.6\nGross margin 250.1 244.6\n% of revenue 42.6 % 44.0 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 215.0 198.0\n% of revenue 36.6 % 35.6 %\nDepreciation and amortization 4.8 4.4\nOperating income 30.3 42.2\nTotal other expense, net (1.3) (4.3)\nIncome tax expense (12.5) (12.3)\nEffective income tax rate 43.0 % 32.5 %\nNet income 16.5 25.6\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 0.3\nNet income attributable to Amedisys, Inc. $ 16.9 $ 26.0\nOn a consolidated basis, our operating income decreased $12 million on a $32 million increase in net service revenue. Our year-over-year results reflect an\nincrease in our merger-related expenses totaling $12 million. Excluding our merger-related expenses, our operating income was flat on a net service revenue\nincrease of $32 million. Rate increases and home health volume growth, which are the main drivers of our revenue growth, were offset by planned wage\nincreases, wage inflation, a shift in our home health payor mix, investments in hospice clinical staffing, an increase in our health insurance costs and an\nincrease in our general and administrative expenses.\nAdditionally, several of our care centers located in Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene near\nthe end of the quarter. We estimate that the storm resulted in a negative impact to our home health episodic admissions of approximately 300 for the three-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024. We also incurred\n26\nincremental costs related to inclement weather pay, fuel and supplies. We expect our fourth quarter results to continue to be impacted by Hurricane Helene as\nwell as Hurricane Milton which made landfall in October.\nOur operating results reflect a $17 million increase in our general and administrative expenses compared to the prior year. Excluding the increase in our\nmerger-related expenses ($12 million), our general and administrative expenses increased $5 million primarily due to planned wage increases and higher\nincentive compensation costs.\nTotal other expense, net includes the following items (amounts in millions):\nFor the Three-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nInterest income $ 2.0 $ 1.3\nInterest expense (7.7) (8.0)\nEquity in earnings from equity method investments 1.9 1.2\nMiscellaneous, net 2.5 1.2\nTotal other expense, net $ (1.3) $ (4.3)\n27\nHome Health Segment\nThe following table summarizes our home health segment results of operations:\nFor the Three-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nFinancial Information (in millions):\nMedicare $ 212.1 $ 217.9\nNon-Medicare 160.0 133.7\nNet service revenue 372.1 351.6\nCost of service, inclusive of depreciation 222.2 201.6\nGross margin 149.9 150.0\nGeneral and administrative expenses 93.3 91.4\nDepreciation and amortization 2.1 1.8\nOperating income $ 54.5 $ 56.8\nSame Store Growth(1):\nMedicare revenue (3 %) (2 %)\nNon-Medicare revenue 20 % 17 %\nTotal admissions 12 % 4 %\nTotal volume(2) 9 % 3 %\nKey Statistical Data - Total(3):\nAdmissions 109,856 98,527\nRecertifications 47,431 45,693\nTotal volume 157,287 144,220\nMedicare completed episodes 71,118 72,714\nAverage Medicare revenue per completed episode(4) $ 3,021 $ 3,015\nMedicare visits per completed episode(5) 12.0 12.4\nVisiting clinician cost per visit $ 108.87 $ 105.06\nClinical manager cost per visit 12.65 11.98\nTotal cost per visit $ 121.52 $ 117.04\nVisits 1,829,075 1,723,289\n(1)Same store information represents the percent change in our Medicare, Non-Medicare and Total revenue, admissions or volume for the period as a\npercent of the Medicare, Non-Medicare and Total revenue, admissions or volume of the prior period.

Volume growth and rate increases, which are the main\ndrivers of our revenue growth, were offset by a shift in our payor mix, planned wage increases, wage inflation and higher health insurance costs.\n28\nAdditionally, several of our care centers located in Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene near\nthe end of the quarter. We estimate that the storm resulted in a negative impact to our home health episodic admissions of approximately 300 for the three-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024. We also incurred incremental costs related to inclement weather pay, fuel and supplies. We expect our fourth quarter\nresults to continue to be impacted by Hurricane Helene as well as Hurricane Milton which made landfall in October.\nNet Service Revenue\nOur net service revenue increased $21 million as a result of total volume growth of 9% and rate increases (both Medicare and per visit).\nCost of Service, Inclusive of Depreciation\nOur cost of service consists of costs associated with direct clinician care in the homes of our patients as well as the cost of clinical managers who monitor the\noverall delivery of care. Overall, our total cost of service increased 10% due to a 4% increase in our total cost per visit and a 6% increase in total visits year\nover year. The 4% increase in our total cost per visit is primarily due to planned wage increases, wage inflation, an increase in health insurance costs and visit\nmix.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased $2 million due to planned wage increases and higher incentive compensation costs partially offset by\nsavings associated with clinical optimization and reorganization initiatives.\nHospice Segment\nThe following table summarizes our hospice segment results of operations:\nFor the Three-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nFinancial Information (in millions):\nMedicare $ 197.8 $ 188.9\nNon-Medicare 10.1 11.3\nNet service revenue 207.9 200.2\nCost of service, inclusive of depreciation 107.7 104.2\nGross margin 100.2 96.0\nGeneral and administrative expenses 49.7 48.4\nDepreciation and amortization 0.8 0.8\nOperating income $ 49.7 $ 46.8\nSame Store Growth(1):\nMedicare revenue 5 % 1 %\nHospice admissions (4 %) (6 %)\nAverage daily census 1 % (2 %)\nKey Statistical Data - Total(2):\nHospice admissions 11,488 11,968\nAverage daily census 13,004 12,943\nRevenue per day, net $ 173.74 $ 168.11\nCost of service per day $ 89.92 $ 87.48\nAverage discharge length of stay 98 94\n(1)Same store information represents the percent change in our Medicare revenue, Hospice admissions or average daily census for the period as a\npercent of the Medicare revenue, Hospice admissions or average daily census of the prior period.

The increase in our cost of service per day is due to\nplanned wage increases, wage inflation, investments in hospice clinical staffing and an increase in our health insurance costs. These items were partially offset\nby lower contractor utilization.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses increased $1 million primarily due to planned wage increases.\nHigh Acuity Care Segment\nThe following table summarizes our high acuity care segment results of operations:\nFor the Three-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nFinancial Information (in millions):\nMedicare $ — $ —\nNon-Medicare 7.7 4.4\nNet service revenue 7.7 4.4\nCost of service, inclusive of depreciation 7.7 5.8\nGross margin — (1.4)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 5.7 5.3\nDepreciation and amortization 0.8 0.7\nOperating loss $ (6.5) $ (7.4)\nKey Statistical Data - Total:\nFull risk admissions 217 150\nLimited risk admissions 656 430\nTotal admissions 873 580\nTotal admissions growth 51 % 35 %\nFull risk revenue per episode $ 9,997 $ 10,168\nLimited risk revenue per episode $ 6,623 $ 6,242\nNumber of admitting joint ventures 9 10\nOperating Results\nOur year over year results were impacted by growth in our home recovery care services.\nWe expect our high acuity care segment to continue to generate operating losses; however, we also expect improvement as we leverage our operating structure\nthrough growth in current and future joint ventures and expansion of palliative care at home arrangements.\n30\nNet Service Revenue\nOur net service revenue increased $3 million as a result of growth in our home recovery care services. Our high acuity care segment achieved its highest total\nadmissions volume since inception during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024.\nCost of Service, Inclusive of Depreciation\nOur cost of service consists primarily of medical costs associated with direct clinician care provided to our patients during the applicable episode period, costs\nassociated with our virtual care unit (“VCU”) which enables us to provide monitoring services and facilitates virtual patient rounding visits via telehealth and\ncosts associated with resources to support our risk-based palliative care at home contract as well as other palliative care arrangements. The increase in cost of\nservice over prior year is related to growth in volume.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses, which primarily consist of salaries, benefits and incentive compensation costs, increased less than $1 million year\nover year.\nCorporate\nThe following table summarizes our corporate results of operations:\nFor the Three-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nFinancial Information (in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 66.3 $ 52.9\nDepreciation and amortization 1.1 1.1\nTotal operating expenses $ 67.4 $ 54.0\nCorporate expenses consist of costs related to our executive management and corporate and administrative support functions, primarily information services,\naccounting, finance, billing and collections, legal, compliance, risk management, procurement, marketing, clinical administration, training, human resources\nand administration.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses increased $13 million year over year, which is inclusive of an increase in merger-related expenses totaling $12\nmillion.

Our year-over-year results were\nimpacted by an increase in our merger-related expenses totaling $24 million and the divestiture of our personal care line of business (which contributed $15\nmillion in net service revenue and $2 million in operating income in the prior year). Excluding these items, our operating income increased $18 million on a\n$100 million increase in net service revenue due to rate increases and home health volume growth, which are the main drivers of revenue growth, partially\noffset by planned wage increases, wage inflation, a shift in our home health payor mix, investments in hospice clinical staffing, an increase in our health\ninsurance costs and an increase in our general and administrative expenses.\nOur operating results reflect a $31 million increase in our general and administrative expenses compared to the prior year. Excluding the increase in our\nmerger-related expenses ($24 million) and the general and administrative expenses of our personal care line of business ($2 million in the prior year), our\ngeneral and administrative expenses increased $9 million due to planned wage increases, higher incentive compensation costs and higher legal and information\ntechnology fees. These items were partially offset by lower acquisition and integration costs and savings associated with clinical optimization and\nreorganization initiatives.\nTotal other expense, net includes the following items (amounts in millions):\nFor the Nine-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nInterest income $ 5.4 $ 2.4\nInterest expense (23.8) (23.0)\nEquity in earnings from equity method investments 4.3 9.4\nMerger termination fee — (106.0)\nMiscellaneous, net 5.4 5.3\nTotal other expense, net $ (8.7) $ (112.0)\nThe merger termination fee represents the fee associated with Amedisys' termination of the OPCH Merger Agreement.

The increase in cost of service over prior year\nis related to growth in volume.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses, which primarily consist of salaries, benefits and incentive compensation costs, increased $2 million primarily due to\nplanned wage increases and higher incentive compensation costs resulting largely from the reversal of incentive compensation costs in prior year.\n36\nCorporate\nThe following table summarizes our corporate results of operations:\nFor the Nine-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nFinancial Information (in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 196.3 $ 173.6\nDepreciation and amortization 2.9 4.8\nTotal operating expenses $ 199.2 $ 178.4\nCorporate general and administrative expenses increased $23 million year over year, which is inclusive of an increase in merger-related expenses totaling $24\nmillion. Excluding these costs, our corporate general and administrative expenses decreased $1 million primarily due to lower acquisition and integration costs\nand lower costs associated with clinical optimization and reorganization initiatives. These items were partially offset by planned wage increases, higher\nincentive compensation costs and higher legal and information technology fees.\nCorporate depreciation and amortization decreased $2 million year over year due to a reduction in amortization expense related to non-compete agreements\nthat were fully amortized as of June 30, 2023.\n37\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (amounts in millions):\nFor the Nine-Month Periods\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash provided by operating activities $ 151.4 $ 76.9\nCash (used in) provided by investing activities (7.1) 37.1\nCash used in financing activities (37.7) (74.1)\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 106.6 39.9\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period 138.9 54.1\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 245.5 $ 94.0\nOur operating cash flow increased $74.5 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 primarily due to higher collections of accounts receivable and the timing of the payment of accounts payable. Our prior year accounts\nreceivable collections were impacted by delays in billing and payor rate changes during the third quarter.\nOur investing activities primarily consist of the purchase of property and equipment and technology assets, investments and acquisitions/divestitures. Cash\nused in investing activities totaled $7.1 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily related to the purchase of property\nand equipment and technology assets as well as investments in joint ventures. Cash provided by investing activities totaled $37.1 million during the nine-month\nperiod ended September 30, 2023 and was primarily related to the divestiture of our personal care line of business.\nOur financing activities primarily consist of borrowings under our term loan and/or revolving credit facility, repayments of borrowings, the remittance of taxes\nassociated with shares withheld on non-cash compensation and noncontrolling interest contributions and distributions. Cash used in financing activities totaled\n$37.7 million and $74.1 million during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was primarily related to the repayment of\nborrowings and the remittance of taxes associated with shares withheld on non-cash compensation. Net proceeds from the divestiture of our personal care line\nof business were used to pay down a portion of our outstanding term loan borrowings during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023.\nLiquidity\nTypically, our principal source of liquidity is the collection of our patient accounts receivable, primarily through the Medicare program. In addition to our\ncollection of patient accounts receivable, from time to time, we can and do obtain additional sources of liquidity by the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nPrior to February 2024, the Company exclusively utilized Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, to submit patient claims to Medicare and all\nother payors for reimbursement. On February 22, 2024, UnitedHealth Group announced that on February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare’s information\ntechnology systems were impacted by a cybersecurity incident. The Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident did not impact our day-to-day operations;\nhowever, we were delayed in submitting patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors which resulted in a reduction in our operating cash flow and an increase\nin our accounts receivable during the first and second quarters. There was minimal impact to our Medicare claim submissions as we were able to quickly\nredirect our Medicare claims to an alternative clearinghouse. As of September 30, 2024, we have resolved the build up in accounts receivable resulting from the\nChange Healthcare outage, and we are continuing to utilize an additional clearinghouse to submit patient claims for reimbursement.\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, we spent $6.1 million in capital expenditures and investments in technology assets as compared to\n$10.6 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. Our capital expenditures and investments in technology assets for 2024 are expected to\nbe approximately $8.0 million, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions.\n38\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $245.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $511.2 million in availability under our $550.0 million Revolving Credit\nFacility.\nBased on our operating forecasts and our debt service requirements, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital requirements\nand debt service requirements for the next twelve months and beyond.\nOutstanding Patient Accounts Receivable\nOur patient accounts receivable decreased $12 million from December 31, 2023. Our cash collections as a percentage of revenue was 101% and 100% for the\nnine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our days revenue outstanding at September 30, 2024 was 44.4 days, which is a decrease\nof 3.3 days from December 31, 2023 and a decrease of 5.4 days when compared to September 30, 2023.\nOur patient accounts receivable includes unbilled receivables which are aged based upon our initial service date. We monitor unbilled receivables on a care\ncenter by care center basis to ensure that all efforts are made to bill claims within timely filing deadlines. Our unbilled patient accounts receivable can be\nimpacted by pre-claim reviews in the Review Choice Demonstration states, reviews under the Targeted Probe and Educate program, voluntary pre-bill edits and\nreviews, efforts to secure needed documentation to bill (orders, consents, etc.), integrations of acquisitions, changes of ownership and any regulatory and\nprocedural updates impacting claim submissions. The timely filing deadline for Medicare is one year from the date of the last billable service in the 30-day\nbilling period and varies by state for Medicaid-reimbursable services and among insurance companies and other private payors.\nThe following schedules detail our patient accounts receivable, by payor class, aged based upon initial date of service (amounts in millions, except days\nrevenue outstanding):\n0-90 91-180 181-365 Over 365 Total\nAt September 30, 2024:\nMedicare patient accounts receivable $ 176.8 $ 7.6 $ 1.4 $ 0.2 $ 186.0\nOther patient accounts receivable:\nMedicaid 20.9 3.1 2.0 — 26.0\nPrivate 76.8 6.0 6.3 — 89.1\nTotal $ 97.7 $ 9.1 $ 8.3 $ — $ 115.1\nTotal patient accounts receivable $ 301.1\nDays revenue outstanding (1) 44.4\n0-90 91-180 181-365 Over 365 Total\nAt December 31, 2023:\nMedicare patient accounts receivable $ 190.3 $ 16.1 $ 6.4 $ 1.9 $ 214.7\nOther patient accounts receivable:\nMedicaid 17.8 1.4 0.5 — 19.7\nPrivate 67.4 6.6 5.0 — 79.0\nTotal $ 85.2 $ 8.0 $ 5.5 $ — $ 98.7\nTotal patient accounts receivable $ 313.4\nDays revenue outstanding (1) 47.7\n(1) Our calculation of days revenue outstanding is derived by dividing our ending patient accounts receivable at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 by our average daily net service revenue for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n39\nIndebtedness\nThird Amendment to the Credit Agreement\nOur Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion, which includes a $550.0 million\nRevolving Credit Facility and a term loan facility with a principal amount of up to $450.0 million (the \"Amended Term Loan Facility\" and collectively with the\nRevolving Credit Facility, the \"Amended Credit Facility\"). On March 10, 2023, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Credit Agreement (as amended by\nthe Third Amendment, the \"Third Amended Credit Agreement\") which (i) formally replaced the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") with the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") for interest rate pricing and (ii) allowed for the disposition of our personal care business. In accordance with the\nrequirements under the Third Amended Credit Agreement, net proceeds received from the divestiture of our personal care line of business were used to prepay\na portion of our Amended Term Loan Facility during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023.\nThe loans issued under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest on a per annum basis, at our election, at either: (i) the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate or\n(ii) the Term SOFR plus the Applicable Rate. The “Base Rate” means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%\nper annum, (b) the prime rate of interest established by the Administrative Agent, and (c) the Term SOFR plus 1% per annum. The “Term SOFR” means the\nquoted rate per annum equal to the SOFR for an interest period of one or three months (as selected by us) plus the SOFR adjustment of 0.10%.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our $550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Our weighted average interest rate\nfor borrowings under our Amended Term Loan Facility was 7.2% for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 7.1% and 6.6% for the\nthree and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our availability under our $550.0 million Revolving Credit Facility was $511.2 million as we have no outstanding borrowings and\n$38.8 million outstanding in letters of credit. We are in compliance with our covenants under the Third Amended Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024.\nSee Note 5 - Long-Term Obligations to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on our outstanding long-term obligations.\nInflation\nOur operations have been materially impacted by the current inflationary environment as we have experienced inflation in our labor costs. We expect inflation\nto continue to impact our operations throughout 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the impacts of inflation on our results of operations have been partially\nmitigated by rate increases and clinical optimization and reorganization initiatives. No assurance can be given as to our ability to offset the impacts of inflation\nin the future.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nSee Part II, Item 7 – Critical Accounting Estimates and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for accounting policies and related estimates we believe are the most critical to understanding our condensed consolidated financial statements,\nfinancial condition and results of operations and which require complex management judgment and assumptions or involve uncertainties. These critical\naccounting estimates include revenue recognition, business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets. There have not been any changes to our\nsignificant accounting policies or their application since we filed our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. Our Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility carry a floating interest rate which is tied to the\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") and the Prime Rate, and therefore, our condensed consolidated statements of operations and our condensed\nconsolidated statements of cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, the total amount of outstanding debt subject to\ninterest rate fluctuations was $355.0 million. A 1.0% interest rate change would cause interest expense to change by approximately $3.6 million annually,\nassuming the Company makes no principal repayments.\n40\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed,\nsummarized, disclosed and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. This information is also accumulated and communicated to\nour management and Board of Directors to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as of September 30, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures, as such term is defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.\nBased on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a\nreasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that have occurred during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, that have materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to materially impact, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls\nover financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if\nany, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by\nmanagement override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and\nthere can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of\ncontrols’ effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in\nthe degree of compliance with policies and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their\nobjectives and, based on an evaluation of our controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly\nReport.\n41\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information concerning our legal proceedings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A.\n“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. These risks, which could materially affect our business, financial\ncondition or future results, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be\nimmaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nThe risk factors set forth below update, and should be read together with, the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023:\nOur business depends on our information systems. A cyber-attack, security breach or our inability to effectively integrate, manage and keep our\ninformation systems secure and operational could disrupt our operations.\nIn general, all information systems, including those we host or have hosted by third parties, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, human error, malicious acts, break-ins and other intentional or unintentional events. Our business is also at risk from and may\nbe materially impacted and/or disrupted by information security incidents, such as ransomware, malware, viruses, phishing, social engineering and other\nsecurity events. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to more sophisticated\nsecurity threats. These events can also result from internal compromises, such as human error or a rogue employee or contractor, and can occur on our systems\nor on the systems of our partners and subcontractors. Additionally, our current information systems are subject to other non-environmental risks, including\ntechnological obsolescence, in some instances, which may create increased security and/or operational risk.\nOur networks, systems and devices store sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information of\nour patients, partners and employees. We have installed a number of protective technology systems and devices on our network, systems and point of care\ntablets in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to information created, received, transmitted and maintained by us. However, healthcare companies are\nroutinely targeted by threat actors, and no level of security can guarantee that cybersecurity incidents will not occur. In the event of a sophisticated ransomware\nattack, malware, viruses, phishing or social engineering, our technology may fail to adequately secure the protected health information and personal\ninformation we create, receive, transmit and maintain in our databases. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our patients and regulators, which\ncould result in fines, litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows. Even if we are not held liable, any resulting negative publicity could harm our business and distract the attention of management.\nAs a healthcare provider, we face increased legal and regulatory compliance risk in the event of a cyber-attack. Healthcare providers and health insurance plans\nmust comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\") regulations regarding the privacy and security of protected\nhealth information. The HIPAA regulations impose significant requirements on providers with regard to how such protected health information may be used\nand disclosed. Further, the regulations include extensive and complex requirements for providers to establish reasonable and appropriate administrative,\ntechnical and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information. HIPAA directs the Secretary of the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities (and their business associates, as\nthat term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements. Entities within the U.S. that are found to be in violation of HIPAA may be\nsubject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a\nresolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when providers establish reasonable and\nappropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards, it is difficult to fully protect information systems from a breach or security incident. In the event\na provider experiences a \"breach\" and protected health information is compromised, the provider is obligated under HIPAA to notify individuals, the\ngovernment, and in the event the breach involves 500 or more individuals, the media. There are significant costs associated with a breach, including\ninvestigation costs, remediation and mitigation costs, notification costs, attorney fees, litigation and the potential for reputational harm and lost revenues due to\na loss in confidence in the provider. We cannot predict the costs to comply with these laws or the costs associated with a potential breach of protected health\ninformation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our\nbusiness reputation.\nIn addition to federal regulators, state attorneys general are also enforcing proactive security protocols and reporting requirements relating to information\nsecurity breaches. All 50 states and the U.S. territories have breach notification laws; some\n42\nof these laws also include proactive data security requirements. In addition to state laws regarding confidentiality of medical information, several states\nexpanded state privacy laws regarding personal information which is more broadly defined than medical information.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to\nmitigate and alleviate problems caused by security incidents, including unauthorized access to protected health information and personal information stored in\nour information systems and the introduction of computer viruses or other malicious software programs to our systems. If we don't expend capital and other\nresources to continually enhance our security systems, our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business operations and\nreputation could be materially adversely affected by federal and state fines and penalties, legal claims or proceedings, cancellation of contracts and loss of\npatients if security breaches are not prevented.\nOur business depends on effective, secure and operational information systems that include systems provided by or hosted by external contractors, partners and\nother service providers. For example, our care centers depend upon information systems and software hosted by third-party vendors for patient care,\naccounting, billing, collections, risk management, quality assurance, human resources, payroll and other information considered to be sensitive and/or\nconfidential, including protected health information. These third-party vendors or business associates, in the event the vendor creates, receives, transmits or\nmaintains protected health information on our behalf, are required to comply with substantially the same HIPAA requirements as the healthcare provider. This\nis accomplished through the use of \"Business Associate Agreements\" with vendors. However, third- and fourth-party security incidents and supply-chain cyber\nattacks have been increasingly common, and there is no way for an organization to ensure that such incidents and attacks do not occur. The occurrence of any\ninformation system failure, breach or security incident, or a vendor's breach of the Business Associate Agreement could result in interruptions, delays, breaches\nof protected health information and personal information, loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of these systems and the\ninformation they create, receive, transmit or maintain. An extended service outage affecting these or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single\nsource from which we obtain the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. For example, in February 2024,\nUnitedHealth Group announced a cyber-attack on the information technology systems of its subsidiary, Change Healthcare, one of the largest providers of\nhealthcare payment systems in the United States. The Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident did not impact our day-to-day operations; however, we were\ndelayed in submitting patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors. There was minimal impact to our Medicare claim submissions as we were able to quickly\nredirect our Medicare claims to an alternative clearinghouse. The delays in submitting non-Medicare claims resulted in a reduction of our operating cash flow\nand an estimated increase to our accounts receivable of approximately $60 million during the three month-period ended March 31, 2024. Any of these events or\ncircumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and they\ncould harm our business reputation.\nIf we are subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future, this could result in harm to patients; business interruptions and delays; the loss,\nmisappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other\napplicable laws; reputational damage and federal and state governmental inquiries. Any such problems or failures and the costs incurred in correcting any such\nproblems or failures could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, to\nthe extent our external information technology contractors or other service providers have their own cyber-attack, security event or information technology\nfailure, become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems we have licensed from them, our operations could be materially adversely affected. A failure\nto restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows. Because of the protected health information we store and transmit, loss of electronically stored information for\nany reason could expose us to risk of regulatory action and litigation and possible liability and loss.\nProblems with, or the failure of, our technology and systems or any system upgrades or programming changes associated with such technology and systems\ncould have a material adverse effect on our operations, patient care, data capture and integrity, medical documentation, billing, collections, assessment of\ninternal controls and management and reporting capabilities. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability or availability of our information\nsystems, our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be materially adversely affected.\nOur information systems and applications also require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational and security needs. Our\nacquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems. We regularly upgrade and expand our information systems’ capabilities.\nIf we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain or expand our systems properly, we\ncould suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory investigations or audits and increases in administrative expenses.\nWe believe we have all the necessary licenses from third parties to use technology and software that we do not own. A third-party could, however, allege that\nwe are infringing its rights, which may deter our ability to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms from the third-party, if at all, or cause the third-\nparty to commence litigation against us. In addition, we may\n43\nfind it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets, to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the scope and validity of any\nproprietary rights of others. Any such litigation, or the failure to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights, could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nDelays in payment may cause liquidity problems.\nOur business is characterized by delays from the time we provide services to the time we receive payment for these services. Timing delays in billings and\ncollections may cause working capital shortages. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in\nachieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity. It is possible that delays in obtaining documentation support, information technology system problems\nor outages, or Medicare or other payor issues or industry trends may extend our collection period, which may materially adversely affect our working capital,\nand our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk.\nIn February 2024, UnitedHealth Group announced a cyberattack on the information technology systems of its subsidiary, Change Healthcare, one of the largest\nproviders of healthcare payment systems in the United States. The Change Healthcare cybersecurity incident did not impact our day-to-day operations;\nhowever, we were delayed in submitting patient claims to certain non-Medicare payors. There was minimal impact to our Medicare claim submissions as we\nwere able to quickly redirect our Medicare claims to an alternative clearinghouse. The delays in submitting non-Medicare claims resulted in a reduction of our\noperating cash flow and an estimated increase to our accounts receivable of approximately $60 million during the three month-period ended March 31, 2024.\nAny similar events or circumstances, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows.\nOn May 29, 2018, CMS issued a notice indicating its intention to re-launch a home health agency pre-claim review demonstration project. Now called the\nReview Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services (\"RCD\") and fully implemented in six states (Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and\nOklahoma), RCD gives home health agencies three initial options: pre-claim review of all claims, post-payment review of all claims or minimal post-payment\nreview with a 25% payment reduction for all home health services. Reduced review options are available for home health agencies that demonstrate\ncompliance.\nCMS has also implemented the Targeted Probe and Educate (\"TPE\") program for home health and hospice providers to help reduce provider claim denials and\neducate providers on appropriate billing practices. Under the TPE program, Medicare Administrative Contractors (\"MACs\") use data analysis to identify\nproviders who have high claim error rates, unusual billing practices or provide services that have high national error rates. If a provider is selected for a TPE\nreview by a MAC, the initial volume of claims reviewed is limited to 20 to 40 claims and can include up to three rounds of claims review, if necessary, with\ncorresponding provider education and a subsequent period to allow for improvement. If results do not improve sufficiently after three rounds, the MAC may\nrefer the provider to CMS for further action which may include 100% prepay review, extrapolation, referral to a Recovery Auditor and/or referral for\nrevocation from the Medicare program. Providers will not be under TPE review and RCD at the same time. Providers currently on TPE review will be removed\nprior to CMS implementing RCD in that particular state.\nCompliance with the RCD and TPE processes has resulted in increased administrative costs and delays in reimbursement for services in the states subject to\nRCD and TPE review. These delays could materially adversely affect our working capital.\nAdditionally, our hospice operations may experience payment delays when attempting to collect funds from state Medicaid programs in certain instances.\nDelays in receiving payments from these programs may also materially adversely affect our working capital.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nThe following table provides the information with respect to purchases made by us of shares of our common stock during each of the months during the three-\nmonth period ended September 30, 2024.

DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n(a) 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders\nAs previously disclosed, on June 26, 2023, Amedisys, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“UnitedHealth Group”), and Aurora\nHoldings Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan\nof Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Amedisys with Amedisys continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly\nowned subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group (the “Merger”). The consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the expiration or\ntermination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Amedisys and UnitedHealth Group continue\nto work cooperatively with the DOJ staff in their review of the Merger, but Amedisys cannot be certain as to when the DOJ's review will be completed or the\noutcome of that review. To ensure continued compliance with Nasdaq listing rules requiring listed companies to hold an annual meeting before the end of each\nfiscal year, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) determined on November 4, 2024 that the 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the “Annual\nMeeting”) will be held on Monday, December 30, 2024 if the Merger has not closed by that date. If the Merger closes before December 30, 2024, the Board\nwill cancel the Annual Meeting. The record date for the Annual Meeting will be December 5, 2024. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on that\ndate may attend and vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.\nBecause the date of the Annual Meeting will differ by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders,\nthe previously announced deadline for stockholder proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act is no longer applicable. Under the new deadline\nset by the Company, any stockholder proposal intended to be included in the Company’s proxy materials for the Annual Meeting pursuant to Exchange Act\nRule 14a-8 must be delivered to, or mailed to and received at, the Company’s principal executive offices located at 3854 American Way, Suite A, Baton Rouge,\nLA 70816, Attn: Corporate Secretary, on or before the close of business on November 18, 2024, which the Company has determined to be a reasonable time\nbefore it expects to begin to print and distribute its proxy materials for the Annual Meeting. In addition to complying with this deadline, stockholder proposals\nintended to be included in the Company’s proxy materials for the Annual Meeting must also comply with all applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission rules, including Exchange Act Rule 14a-8.\nIn addition, because the date of the Annual Meeting will be more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting of\nStockholders, the previously announced deadline for stockholder proposals or nominations under Section 2.8 of the Company’s Amended and Restated By-\nLaws (the “By-Laws”) is no longer applicable. Pursuant to the By-Laws, the new deadline for any stockholder proposal or nomination (including nominations\npursuant to Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act), other than pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, intended to be brought before the Annual Meeting must be\ndelivered to, or mailed to and received at, the Company’s principal executive offices located at 3854 American Way, Suite A, Baton Rouge, LA 70816, Attn:\nCorporate Secretary, on or before the close of business on November 17, 2024. In addition to complying with this deadline, stockholder proposals or\nnominations intended to be brought before the Annual Meeting must also comply with all applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the By-\nLaws and applicable law, including the additional requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act.\nCompensation Adjustments for Nick Muscato\nOn November 5, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board approved and ratified the following compensation adjustments for Nick Muscato, the\nCompany’s Chief Strategy Officer: (i) an increase in Mr. Muscato’s base salary from $437,750 to $525,000 effective immediately, (ii) a one-time equity award\ngrant of time-based restricted stock units, with a $1 million grant date value, which will vest ratably over three years from the date of grant assuming Mr.\nMuscato remains employed on each such vesting date, in exchange for Mr. Muscato’s agreeing not to resign his employment with UnitedHealth\n45\nGroup for Good Reason (as defined in the Amended and Restated Severance Plan for Executive Officers and the Amedisys 2018 Omnibus Incentive\nCompensation Plan) due to a material diminution of his authority, responsibilities or duties during the six-month period following the Effective Time of the\nMerger, and (iii) a special cash performance bonus in the amount of $200,000 in recognition of Mr. Muscato’s exceptional performance in support of the\npending Merger, which is required to be repaid to the Company if Mr. Muscato voluntarily leaves the Company prior to the closing of the Merger.\n(b) The disclosure included in section (a) of this Part II, Item 5 related to the 2024 Annual Meeting is hereby incorporated by reference into this section (b).\n(c) None.\n46\nITEM 6.

(the “Company”), as authorized pursuant to Section 19 of the Plan.\nWHEREAS, the Company established and maintains the Plan, as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time;\nWHEREAS, Section 19 of the Plan permits the Committee to amend the Plan without stockholder approval as set forth\ntherein; and\nWHEREAS, the Committee now desires to amend the Plan, effective as of the day immediately preceding the closing date\nof the Company’s merger (the “Merger”) with UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (the “Effective Date”), yet contingent upon such\nclosing, to provide that vested stock options be exercised automatically on the day they expire if they are “in-the-money” at the time\nof expiration.\nNOW, THEREFORE, for Awards that are outstanding on the Effective Date, the Plan is hereby amended, contingent upon\nthe closing of the Merger, effective as of the Effective Date, as follows:\n1.\nSection 8 of the Plan is hereby amended by adding a new subsection 8.6 as follows:\n8.6. Automatic Exercise of Certain Expiring Options. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Award\nNotice or Award agreement (other than this Section 8), on the last trading day on which all or a portion of an outstanding Option may\nbe exercised, if as of the close of trading on such day the then Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock exceeds the per share\nExercise Price of the Option by at least $.01 (such expiring portion of an Option that is so in-the-money, an “Auto-Exercise Eligible\nOption”), the optionee shall be deemed to have automatically exercised such Auto-Exercise Eligible Option (to the extent it has not\npreviously been exercised, forfeited, or terminated) as of the close of trading in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.6. In\nthe event of an automatic exercise pursuant to this Section 8.6, the Company shall reduce the number of shares of Common Stock\nissued to the optionee upon such optionee’s automatic exercise of the Auto-Exercise Eligible Option in an amount necessary to\nsatisfy (1) the optionee’s Exercise Price obligation for the Auto-Exercise Eligible Option and (2) the minimum amount of tax\nrequired to be withheld in connection with the automatic exercise (or such other rate that will not cause adverse accounting\nconsequences for\nthe Company) unless the Committee deems that a different method of satisfying such withholding obligations is practicable and\nadvisable, in each case based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the close of trading on the date of exercise. In\naccordance with procedures established by the Committee, an optionee may notify the Company’s record-keeper in writing in\nadvance that he or she does not wish for the Auto-Exercise Eligible Option to be exercised. This Section 8.6 shall not apply to any\nOption to the extent that this Section causes the Option to fail to qualify for favorable tax treatment under applicable law. In its\ndiscretion, the Company may determine to cease automatically exercising Options at any time.\n2.\nCapitalized terms used in this Amendment and not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Plan.\n3.\nThis Amendment shall be void and of no force and effect if the Merger does not close.\nExcept as specifically set forth above, the terms of the Plan shall continue in full force and effect.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Committee has caused this Amendment to be adopted and executed on the date first set forth\nabove.\nAmedisys, Inc.\nBy: /s/Teresa L.
