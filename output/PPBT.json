The median OS was 7.72 months (95% CI, 4.00-8.11) with the experimental regimen compared with 5.62 months (95% CI, 3.22-7.89) in the control arm, Cecchini details. This resulted in a hazard ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.31-1.77), translating to a 26% reduction in the risk of death or disease progression.\n\nFurthermore, the median PFS was doubled from 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-5.0) in the control arm to 3.8 months (95% CI, 0.9-3.6) in the investigational arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.33-1.60), corresponding to a 28% reduction in the risk of death or progression, Cecchini adds. Response rates were significantly higher in the investigational arm at 25% vs 6.7% in the control arm, and the disease control rate was 62.5% vs 40.0% with the experimental vs control regimens, respectively. This showed that all efficacy measures favored the investigational regimen, Cecchini explains.\n\nThe addition of CM24 to nivolumab and NALIRIFOX was also well tolerated. The interim analysis suggests that the combination of CM24, nivolumab, and NALIRIFOX has a manageable safety profile and offers longer PFS, supported by higher objective response rates (ORR) and disease control rates (DCR). OS data continue to mature with further analyses.\n\nThe combination therapy could represent a promising second-line treatment option for patients with advanced/metastatic PDAC.\n\nRelated Videos\n\n[![David Schiff, MD]()Dr Schiff on PFS and OS Data With Temozolomide Plus Radiation in Grade II Glioma](/view/dr-schiff-on-pfs-and-os-data-with-temozolomide-plus-radiation-in-grade-ii-glioma)[![Timothy Gershon, MD, PhD]()Dr Gershon on Deep Responses With Mirdametinib in NF1-PN](/view/dr-gershon-on-deep-responses-with-mirdametinib-in-nf1-pn)[![Jordan Hansford, MD]()Dr Hansford on HRQOL Outcomes With Tovorafenib in Pediatric BRAF-Altered Low-Grade Glioma](/view/dr-hansford-on-hrqol-outcomes-with-tovorafenib-in-pediatric-braf-altered-low-grade-glioma)[![James J.

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n_Topline data from Phase 2 CM24 pancreatic cancer trial expected by the end of 2024_\n\n_New CM24 biomarkers data presented during the third quarter of 2024 including two predicting serum biomarkers identified and associated with CM24 novel targets_\n\n_CAPTN-3 tri-specific antibody platform data presented at the ENA Symposium October 2024_\n\nREHOVOT, Israel, November 15, 2024 -- _Purple Biotech Ltd._ (“Purple Biotech” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ/TASE: PPBT), a clinical-stage company developing first-in-class therapies that overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance, today announced financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Marking what we believe to be the most significant value-driving event for Purple Biotech’s clinical programs to date, we are on track to complete CM24’s Phase 2 study in pancreatic cancer and report topline results by the end of this year,” stated Purple Biotech’s CEO, Gil Efron. “The interim Phase 2 CM24 data released so far demonstrated efficacy, and new biomarker data indicate potential to further improve outcomes in a future study through the use of one or more serum biomarkers for patient selection. This would position CM24 as a potentially promising CEACAM1 and Neutrophils Extracellular Trap (NET) targeted therapy. While we advance CM24 as a second line treatment for pancreatic cancer, we are planning to address additional unmet needs in other indications based on CM24’s demonstrated mechanism of action in our Phase 2 study. Our cash runway now extends into the fourth quarter of 2025. We continue to advance our clinical assets and believe we will be soon well positioned for partnerships across our pipeline.”\n\n**Q3 2024 and Recent Clinical & Corporate Highlights: **\n\n●| **Phase 2 CM24 pancreatic cancer study on track for conclusion with topline data expected in 2024: Serum biomarkers may improve outcomes in future studies**  \n---|---  \n  \nNew positive biomarker findings for CM24, a multi-functional CEACAM1 inhibitor, were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research® (AACR) Special Conference on Advances in Pancreatic Cancer Research in a poster titled “Exploratory biomarker evaluation of the randomized Phase 2 cohort of CM24 in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy in advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer”.\n\nThe summary of findings presented at AACR include the following:\n\nü| High CEACAM1 and low PDL1 expression in tumors, as well as their combination were identified as potential biomarkers associated with improved overall survival (OS) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients (HR=0.1 and prolongation of 4.1 months in median OS, _P_ = 0.01, for the combination), which support the CM24/nivolumab combined treatment  \n---|---  \nü| Improved OS was demonstrated for patients with selected pretreatment serum neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) marker myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels (HR=0.38 and prolongation of 3.3 months in median OS, _P_ = 0.1), with a similar trend in patients with NET-positive tumors  \n---|---  \nü| The results presented in the poster propose NETs as a novel mechanism of action and a potential biomarker for CM24-based therapy  \n---|---  \nü| New biomarker data supports the potential for future biomarker-guided studies and the exploration of CM24’s efficacy in other cancers where the novel target CEACAM1 plays a key role in cancer progression and immune evasion.  \n---|---  \n  \nMore recent biomarker data specific to serum CEACAM1, associated with a 79% reduction in risk of death were announced by Purple Biotech in November 2024:\n\nPDAC patients who had pretreatment serum CEACAM1 levels between 6K and 15K pg/mL demonstrated the best outcomes following treatment with CM24 and nivolumab in combination with irinotecan/fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone.\n\nü| Median progression free survival (PFS) of this group was 4.6 months (hazard ratio [HR] < 0.1, P = 0.003)  \n---|---  \nü| Risk of death was reduced by 79% (HR = 0.21, P = 0.04)  \n---|---  \nü| Median OS increased from 3.6 months with chemotherapy alone to 8.7 months with the combination therapy.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Phase 2 randomized study is evaluating CM24 in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab plus standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy as a second line treatment of patients with PDAC. In the experimental arms of the study patients were treated with CM24 plus nivolumab and one of two SoC chemotherapies, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or Nal-IRI/5FU/LV, while patients in the control arms are administered with either respective chemotherapies alone. Sixty-three patients have been enrolled across 18 centers in the U.S., Spain and Israel. The gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel-based part of the study was impacted by informative censoring of the control arm that led to an imbalance between the control and experimental cohorts, rendering this part of the study unsuitable for analysis; this part of the study has no impact on the CM24+nivolumab+Nal-IRI/5FU/LV portion of the study.\n\n●| **NT219 Phase 2 study in head and neck cancer planned to commence H1 2025**  \n---|---  \n  \nA Phase 2 study of NT219, a first-in-class, small molecule dual inhibitor of IRS1/2 and STAT3, is planned to commence in the first half of 2025. The recommended Phase 2 dose of 100 mg/kg was achieved in the prior Phase 1/2 dose escalation study, which demonstrated anti-tumor activity at the target exposure level and was well tolerated in combination with cetuximab as a second line treatment of recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.\n\n●| **CAPTN-3 tri-specific platform data presented at key molecular targets and cancer therapeutics conference**  \n---|---  \n  \nNew data regarding Purple Biotech’s novel tri-specific antibody platform, CAPTN-3, were presented at the 36th European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research (EORTC-NCI-AACR) Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (the “Triple Meeting”) in a poster titled “CAPTN-3: A novel platform of conditionally activated T cell and NK cell engagers”. CAPTN-3 demonstrated sustained tumor regression in a triple negative breast cancer in-vivo model as well as dose dependent activity and synergistic effect of the engager arms in non-small cell lung cancer patient-derived explants. Purple Biotech’s lead tribody candidate, IM1240, demonstrated that cytokine release is 5T4-dependent and suppressed by the conditionally activated capping technology, suggesting a potentially beneficial safety profile of this tribody. The data further demonstrated additional tribodies, suggesting CAPTN-3’s plug and play platform capability. Purple Biotech continues to accumulate data supporting the benefit of dual engagement of both T cells and NK cells.\n\n2\n\n**_Financial Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024_**\n\n**Research and Development Expenses** were $1.3 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 71.7%, compared to $4.6 million in the same period of 2023, mainly due to reduced clinical trials expenses.\n\n**Sales, General and Administrative Expenses** were $0.8 million, compared to $1.2 million in the same period of 2023, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 33.3%, mainly due to a decrease in salary and salary related costs and share based payment expenses.\n\n**Operating Loss** was $2.1 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 63.2%, compared to $5.7 million in the same period of 2023, mainly due to the decrease in research and development expenses.\n\n**Adjusted Operating Loss** (as reconciled below) was $2 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, compared to $5.3 million in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net Loss** for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $0.7 million, or $0.39 per basic and diluted ADS, compared to a net loss of $5 million, or $4.63 per basic and diluted ADS, in the same period of 2023.

The decrease in net loss was mainly due to a $6 million decrease in operating expenses and $3.3 million income from change in fair value of warrants.\n\n**Adjusted net loss** (as reconciled below) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $9.5 million, compared to $13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Non-IFRS Financial Measures.**\n\nThis press release includes information about certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), including adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss. These non-IFRS measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by IFRS and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss adjust for non-cash share-based compensation expenses and adjusted net loss also adjusts for non-cash financial instruments evaluation income. The Company’s management and board of directors utilize these non-IFRS financial measures to evaluate the Company’s performance. The Company provides these non-IFRS measures of the Company’s performance to investors because management believes that these non-IFRS financial measures, when viewed with the Company’s results under IFRS and the accompanying reconciliations, are useful in identifying underlying trends in ongoing operations. However, these non-IFRS measures are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to IFRS measures as indicators of operating performance. Further, these non-IFRS measures should not be considered measures of the Company’s liquidity. A reconciliation of certain IFRS to non-IFRS financial measures has been provided in the tables included in this press release.\n\n**About Purple Biotech**\n\nPurple Biotech Ltd. (NASDAQ/TASE: PPBT) is a clinical-stage company developing first-in-class therapies that seek to overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance. The Company’s oncology pipeline includes CM24, NT219 and IM1240. CM24 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks CEACAM1, that supports tumor immune evasion and survival through multiple pathways. CEACAM1 on tumor cells, immune cells and neutrophils extracellular traps is a novel target for the treatment of multiple cancer indications. As a proof of concept of these novel pathways, the Company is advancing CM24 as a combination therapy with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in a Phase 2 study for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The Company has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb for the Phase 2 clinical trials to evaluate the combination of CM24 with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in addition to chemotherapy. NT219 is a dual inhibitor, novel small molecule that simultaneously targets IRS1/2 and STAT3. A Phase 1 dose escalation study was concluded as a monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab in which NT219 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in combination with cetuximab in second line patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN (R/N SCCHN). The Company is advancing CAPTN-3, a preclinical platform of conditionally-activated tri-specific antibody that engages both T cells and NK cells to induce a strong, localized immune response within the tumor microenvironment. The cleavable capping technology confines the compound’s therapeutic activity to the local tumor microenvironment, and thereby potentially increases the anticipated therapeutic window in patients. The third arm specifically targets the Tumor Associated Antigen (TAA). The technology presents a novel mechanism of action by unleashing both innate and adaptive immune systems to mount an optimal anti-tumoral immune response. IM1240 is the first tri-specific antibody in development that targets 5T4 expressed in a variety of solid tumors and is correlated with advanced disease, increased invasiveness and poor clinical outcomes. The Company’s corporate headquarters are located in Rehovot, Israel.

“the Company”) (NASDAQ/TASE: PPBT), a clinical-stage company developing first-in-class therapies that overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance, today announced new data regarding its tri-specific antibody platform, CAPTN-3, which were presented at the 36th European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research (EORTC-NCI-AACR) Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (the “Triple Meeting”) on October 25, 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.\n\n“CAPTN-3 is a novel technology platform allowing Purple Biotech to develop a variety of new tri-specific antibodies to address different targets on tumors and different mechanisms to treat cancer patients. Our Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling work is aimed to reach first in human clinical studies with our lead candidate IM1240 potentially by 2026,” said Gil Efron, Purple Biotech CEO. “Development of this differentiated platform allows us to potentially offer partners and patients additional antibodies to treat different cancer types.”\n\nCAPTN-3 is a novel platform technology of conditionally activated tri-specific antibodies engaging both **T** cells and **N** K cells to target cancers expressing Tumor Associated Antigen (TAA) (aCD3xaTAAxaNKG2A) to induce a strong and selective immune response against the tumor. The addition of the NK engager aims to enhances the tumor-killing activity, providing a key differentiation for more sustained and potent anti-tumor effects. The anti-NKG2A arm also acts as a checkpoint inhibitor enabling simultaneous NK and T-cell activation. This scaffold is designed to be activated only at the tumor microenvironment (TME) to improve the safety profile and extend the therapeutic index. The capped-aCD3 is cleaved by multiple TME-specific proteases, increasing the likelihood of activation by various tumor types. To further extend the capped tribody half-life, human serum albumin is included. CAPTN-3 leverages a plug and play scaffold system providing a flexible design to easily swap and integrate various antibodies to target a wide range of diseases.\n\nThe platform’s lead compound IM1240 (aCD3xa5T4xaNKG2A) targets 5T4, a TAA expressed in a variety of solid tumors and which is correlated with advanced disease, increased invasiveness, and poor clinical outcome.\n\n“Unleashing both innate and adaptive immune subsets against the tumor through potential engagement of both T cells and NK cells to the tumor, accompanied by NKG2A:HLA-E checkpoint blockage enabling simultaneous activation of NK cell and highly cytotoxic NKG2A+ T cell subsets, is suggested as a powerful mechanism of CAPTN-3 to enhance the anti-tumor activity, and differentiates this approach from others in the field. Our CAPTN-3 platform’s lead candidate, IM1240, was found to induce enhanced and synergistic anti-tumor activity in a clinically-relevant PDE assay of a 5T4-expressing biopsy, as compared to the T cell engager or the NK cell engager bispecific derivatives. CAPTN-3’s conditional activation mechanism, including a selective capping cleavage by TME proteases and TAA dependency, potentially improve safety and efficacy, and therefore result in a wider therapeutic window. The advantages of the cleavable capping technology, in aspects of efficacy, drug exposure, and safety are demonstrated in this poster,” stated Purple Biotech’s VP Research and Development, Dr. Hadas Reuveni. “IM1240’s target, 5T4, which associates with advanced disease, increased invasiveness and poor prognosis, is an attractive target for a variety of solid cancers.”\n\nPurple Biotech’s poster titled “CAPTN-3: A novel platform of conditionally activated T cell and NK cell engagers”, which can be viewed HERE, presented the following:\n\n●| The lead compound, IM1240 demonstrated high affinity binding towards CD3 & NKG2A proteins and CD3 & NKG2A expressing cells, while no binding was detected using the mutated versions of the tribody, indicating specificity. The synergistic effects of the aCD3 and aNKG2A arms in suppressing 5T4+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient-derived explant (PDE) at 10nM were demonstrated, emphasizing CAPTN-3’s potential advantage in a clinically-relevant biological assay. A dose-dependent effect of IM1240 was shown.  \n---|---  \n●| Sustained tumor regression in triple negative breast cancer humanized mice was demonstrated for the capped tribody, which was superior to the uncapped tribody. No effect was shown with the non-cleavable capped tribody whose CD3 binding function is irreversibly blocked.  \n---|---  \n●| Cytotoxic effect and binding to CD3 was fully recovered following capping cleavage.  \n---|---  \n●| PBMC-mediated cytotoxicity against 5T4+ cancer cells was demonstrated at picomolar EC50 while no effect was observed in 5T4- cancer cells.  \n---|---  \n●| IM1240 and non-capped tribody inhibited NKG2A-HLA-E interaction in a dose-dependent manner, while NKG2A mutated tribody had no effect.  \n---|---  \n●| NK cell mediated cytotoxicity against HLA-E expressing cancer cells was demonstrated, while NKG2A mutated tribody had no effect.  \n---|---  \n●| A cytokine release assay from hPBMC showed a 5T4+ cancer cell dependency and was inhibited by the cap, showing superior safety profile.  \n---|---  \n●| Plug and Play abilities of the platform were demonstrated through different tribodies targeting 5T4 (aCD3xa5T4xaNKG2A), EGFR (aCD3xaEGFRxaNKG2A) and NKG2D (aCD3xa5T4xaNKG2D) which demonstrated low nM and selective binding to cells overexpressing the target, and efficient PBMC and NK mediated cytotoxicity.  \n---|---  \n  \n2\n\n**About Purple Biotech**\n\nPurple Biotech Ltd. (NASDAQ/TASE: PPBT) is a clinical-stage company developing first-in-class therapies that seek to overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance. The Company’s oncology pipeline includes CM24, NT219 and IM1240. CM24 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks CEACAM1, that supports tumor immune evasion and survival through multiple pathways. CEACAM1 on tumor cells, immune cells and neutrophils extracellular traps is a novel target for the treatment of multiple cancer indications. As a proof of concept of these novel pathways, the Company is advancing CM24 as a combination therapy with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in a Phase 2 study for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The Company has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb for the Phase 2 clinical trials to evaluate the combination of CM24 with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in addition to chemotherapy. NT219 is a dual inhibitor, novel small molecule that simultaneously targets IRS1/2 and STAT3. A Phase 1 dose escalation study was concluded as a monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab in which NT219 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in combination with cetuximab in second line patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN (R/N SCCHN). The Company is advancing CAPTN-3, a preclinical platform of conditionally-activated tri-specific antibody that engages both T cells and NK cells to induce a strong, localized immune response within the tumor microenvironment. The cleavable capping technology confines the compound’s therapeutic activity to the local tumor microenvironment, and thereby potentially increases the anticipated therapeutic window in patients. The third arm specifically targets the Tumor Associated Antigen (TAA). The technology presents a novel mechanism of action by unleashing both innate and adaptive immune systems to induce an optimal anti-tumoral immune response. IM1240 is the first tri-specific antibody in development that targets 5T4 expressed in a variety of solid tumors and which is correlated with advanced disease, increased invasiveness and poor clinical outcomes.

Purple Biotech Ltd. (“Purple Biotech” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ/TASE: PPBT), a clinical-stage company developing first-in-class therapies that overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance, today announced it has been selected for a poster presentation at the 36th European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, National Cancer Institute, American Association for Cancer Research (EORTC-NCI-AACR) Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (the “Triple Meeting”) held October 23-25, 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nPurple Biotech’s poster titled “CAPTN-3: A novel platform of conditionally activated T cell and NK cell engagers” (Abstract # 450, poster board number: PB438) will be presented by Dr. Hadas Reuveni, VP R&D of Purple Biotech, during a ‘New therapies in immuno oncology’ poster session on Friday, 25 October 2024.\n\nCAPTN-3 is a First-in-class platform of conditionally activated tri-specific antibodies engaging both T cells and NK cells with the tumor to create an immune synapse with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. The NK engager arm (aNKG2A) of our lead compound also acts as a checkpoint inhibitor for both NK cells and highly cytotoxic T cell subsets, unleashing both innate and adaptive immune subsets against the tumor.\n\nPurple Biotech’s lead CAPTN-3 platform candidate, IM1240, targets 5T4 as a tumor associated antigen (TAA), which is overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors and is correlated with advanced disease, increased invasiveness, and poor clinical outcome. 5T4, also known as trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG), is an oncofetal surface protein that is not found on adult healthy tissues but is abnormally expressed in several cancer types. This specific expression pattern as well as the correlation with poor prognosis in different cancer diseases such as lung, gastric, head and neck and other cancers makes it an ideal TAA for various therapeutic approaches.\n\n**About Purple Biotech**\n\nPurple Biotech Ltd.

Biotech Ltd. (“Purple Biotech” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ/TASE: PPBT), a clinical-stage company developing first-in-class therapies that overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance, today reported new positive biomarker findings for its lead oncology therapeutic candidate CM24. These data were presented yesterday at the American Association for Cancer Research® (AACR) Special Conference on Advances in Pancreatic Cancer Research currently ongoing in Boston, in a poster titled, “Exploratory biomarker evaluation of the randomized Phase 2 cohort of CM24 in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy in advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer”.\n\n“We are excited to present additional positive data from our Phase 2 study with CM24. CEACAM1 as a novel target in oncology continues to be supported by these data, underscoring its potential given its high expression on cancer cells, tumor infiltrating leucocytes and on NETs, suggesting the potential multiple roles of CM24 in overcoming immune evasion,” stated Purple Biotech CEO Gil Efron. “Moreover, these data enable us to potentially design biomarker- guided studies for CM24 for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as well as other cancers.”\n\nPurple Biotech’s Phase 2 study is evaluating CM24 in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab plus standard of care (SoC) chemotherapy as a second line treatment of patients with PDAC and compared to SoC chemotherapy alone. Sixty-three patients have been enrolled in the randomized study across 18 centers in the U.S., Spain, and Israel.\n\nThe following is a summary of findings presented in the poster:\n\n**Mechanism of Action**\n\nCM24 blocks CEACAM1 interactions, which have key roles in cancer progression, immune escape and metastasis. CEACAM1 is part of the NET complex, involved in tumor immune evasion, metastasis and cancer-associated thrombosis, affecting patient survival. Purple Biotech has previously presented data that demonstrates that CM24 binds to CEACAM1 on NETs, suppresses NET-induced migration of cancer cells and inhibits _in-vivo_ tumor metastasis. In the poster, Purple Biotech presents data that demonstrates that CM24 also inhibits NET-induced platelet aggregation, an _in-vitro_ assay imitating the thrombosis process.\n\nCM24+nivolumab+Nal-IRI/5FU/LV treatment of PDAC patients reduced serum levels of the NET marker, MPO, and showed potential overall survival (OS) benefit to patients with reduced post-dose MPO as compared to the control arm.\n\n**NET Marker MPO as a Potential Serum Biomarker for Patient Selection for CM24-Based Therapy**\n\nAn analysis of patients with serum MPO levels < 350 ng/mL, demonstrated a potential 62% reduction in risk of death (HR=0.38) for CM24+nivolumab+Nal-IRI/5FU/LV therapy in PDAC patients, and prolongation of 3.3 months in median OS. This compared to an analysis of all patients which demonstrated a potential 25% reduction in risk of death (HR=0.75) and prolongation of 2.1 months in median OS.\n\n**High Tumor CEACAM1 & Low PDL1 as Potential Biomarkers for CM24-Based Therapy **\n\nAn analysis of patients with high CEACAM1+tumor cells (H-score > 115) or low PDL1 (CPS ≤ 1) demonstrated a potential 45% and 65% reduction in risk of death (HR=0.55 and 0.35), respectively.\n\nCombining these two potential biomarkers, suggests augmented outcome of 90% reduction in risk of death (HR=0.1) for CM24+nivolumab+Nal-IRI/5FU/LV therapy in PDAC patients, and prolongation of 4.1 months in median OS (_p value 0.01)._\n\n“A serum biomarker for patient selection is a major advantage for cancer patients in general and PDAC patients in particular. The additional interim data suggesting serum NET levels as a potential biomarker for improving the outcome of CM24-based therapy, together with the ability of this therapy to reduce serum NET levels in PDAC patients and to inhibit NET-related activities in vitro, add supporting evidence for NETs as a new mechanism of action (MoA) and potential biomarker for CM24-based therapy,” said Dr. Hadas Reuveni, VP R&D of Purple Biotech. “Additional encouraging results suggesting that the CM24/ nivolumab/chemotherapy effect is most pronounced among patients with high CEACAM1 expression and low PDL1 also relate to the CM24/nivolumab MoA and support the CM24/nivolumab combined treatment. This may open a new opportunity for patients who are not eligible for anti-PD1 therapy in various indications. A larger sample size is required to confirm the results and better define the cutoff values.”\n\nInterim data from Purple Biotech’s Phase 2 study presented in June at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting demonstrated improvement in OS, progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR) and all other efficacy endpoints in the CM24+nivolumab+Nal-IRI/5FU/LV experimental arm as compared with the SoC control arm. Topline data are expected in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe poster is available on the Publications section of Purple Biotech’s website and in the following link: https://purple-biotech.com/pipeline/#1Publications\n\n2\n\n**About Purple Biotech**\n\nPurple Biotech Ltd. (NASDAQ/TASE: PPBT) is a clinical-stage company developing first-in-class therapies that seek to overcome tumor immune evasion and drug resistance. The Company’s oncology pipeline includes CM24, NT219 and IM1240. CM24 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks CEACAM1, that supports tumor immune evasion and survival through multiple pathways. CEACAM1 on tumor cells, immune cells and neutrophils extracellular traps is a novel target for the treatment of multiple cancer indications. As a proof of concept of these novel pathways, the Company is advancing CM24 as a combination therapy with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in a Phase 2 study for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The Company has entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb for the Phase 2 clinical trials to evaluate the combination of CM24 with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in addition to chemotherapy. NT219 is a dual inhibitor, novel small molecule that simultaneously targets IRS1/2 and STAT3. A Phase 1 dose escalation study was concluded as a monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab in which NT219 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in combination with cetuximab in second line patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN (R/N SCCHN). The Company is advancing CAPTN-3, a preclinical platform of conditionally-activated tri-specific antibody that engages both T cells and NK cells to induce a strong, localized immune response within the tumor microenvironment. The cleavable capping technology confines the compound’s therapeutic activity to the local tumor microenvironment, and thereby potentially increases the anticipated therapeutic window in patients. The third arm specifically targets the Tumor Associated Antigen (TAA). The technology presents a novel mechanism of action by unleashing both innate and adaptive immune systems to mount an optimal anti-tumoral immune response.

(the “**Company** ” or the “**Registrant** ”) is reporting that it plans to change the ratio of its American Depositary Shares (“**ADSs** ”) to its ordinary shares, no par value per share (the “**ADS Ratio** ”), from the current ADS Ratio of one (1) ADS representing ten (10) ordinary shares, to a new ADS Ratio of one (1) ADS representing two hundred (200) ordinary shares (the “**ADS Ratio Change** ”). The ADS Ratio Change is expected to become effective at the beginning of trading on or about September 17, 2024, U.S. Eastern Time (the “**Effective Date** ”). The primary purpose of the ADS Ratio Change is to enable the Company to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“**Nasdaq** ”).\n\nFor the Company’s ADS holders, the ADS Ratio Change will have the same effect as a one-for-twenty reverse ADS split. On the Effective Date, registered holders of the Company’s ADSs held in certificated form will be required on a mandatory basis to surrender their certificated ADSs to The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary bank (the “**Depositary** ”), for cancellation and will receive one (1) new ADS in exchange for every twenty (20) existing ADSs then-held. Holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System and The Depository Trust Company will have their ADSs automatically exchanged and need not take any action. The exchange of every twenty (20) then-held (existing) ADSs for one (1) new ADS will occur automatically on the Effective Date, with the then-held ADSs being cancelled and new ADSs being issued by the Depositary. The Company’s ADSs will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol “PPBT,” although a new CUSIP number 74638P208 has been assigned as a result of the ADS Ratio Change. The ADS Ratio Change will have no impact on the Company’s ordinary shares, which are traded on The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, no ordinary shares will be issued or cancelled in connection with the ADS Ratio Change and holders of the Company’s ordinary shares will be entirely unaffected by the new exchange ratio for ADSs.\n\nNo fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the ADS Ratio Change. Instead, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the Depositary and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees, taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the Depositary.\n\nAs a result of the ADS Ratio Change, the Company’s ADS trading price is expected to increase proportionally, enhancing the suitability of the ADSs for trading on Nasdaq, although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price after the ADS Ratio Change will be equal to or greater than twenty times the ADS trading price before the change.\n\n1\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements in this current report that are forward-looking and not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
