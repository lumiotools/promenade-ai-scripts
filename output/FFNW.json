Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nCompany Release - 10/29/2024\n\n[ Download the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window) PDF 403 KB ](//s25.q4cdn.com/584312509/files/doc_financials/2024/FFNW-Q3-2024-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nRENTON, Wash., Oct. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Financial Northwest, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ GS: FFNW), the holding company for First Financial Northwest Bank (the “Bank”), today reported a net loss of $608,000, or $(0.07) per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $1.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and net income of $1.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of $128,000, or $(0.01) per diluted share, compared to net income of $5.1 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2023.\n\nThe net loss for the quarter was primarily the result of a $1.6 million provision for credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) analysis determined that a provision for credit losses of $1.6 million was appropriate as of September 30, 2024. This provision mainly relates to two participation loans totaling $6.0 million, for which we are not the lead lender. These loans, secured by short-term rehabilitation and assisted living facilities, have been individually evaluated and classified as “substandard” since March 2022 due to a decline in demand for the services provided at such facilities post-COVID. While payments on the loans were current as of September 30, 2024, updated appraisals received during the quarter resulted in an increase in our ACL. The loan guarantors are under contract to sell another property, with the sale expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. Proceeds from this sale are expected to be applied to the two loans, which would improve our position. Additionally, the guarantors reported interest from a national real estate developer in purchasing one of the facilities, though no purchase agreement was entered into as of September 30, 2024. The ACL was also impacted by higher forecasted unemployment rates and increased construction and land development loan balances. Additionally, reserves for unfunded commitments increased by $75,000 due to increased construction lending activity during the quarter.\n\n“While we recorded a provision for credit losses during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, our credit quality remained strong, with only $853,000 in nonaccrual loans relative to our $1.14 billion total loan portfolio. Our strong credit quality is directly related to our top-notch lending department employees who originate, document and underwrite these loans,” stated Joseph W. Kiley III, President and CEO.\n\n“We also continue to work closely with Global Federal Credit Union (“Global”) to prepare for the closing of the pending transaction and to ensure a smooth transition for our customers and employees. I truly appreciate the efforts and patience of our employees, customers, and shareholders as we await the final required approval from the National Credit Union Administration before we can close the transaction,” concluded Kiley.\n\nHighlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024:\n\n  * Net loans receivable totaled $1.13 billion at September 30, 2024, down $8.9 million from the prior quarter end.\n  * Book value per share was $17.39 at September 30, 2024, compared to $17.51 at June 30, 2024, and $17.35 at September 30, 2023.\n  * The Bank’s Tier 1 leverage and total capital ratios were 10.9% and 16.7% at September 30, 2024, compared to 10.9% and 16.6% at June 30, 2024, and 10.3% and 16.0% at September 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * Credit quality remained strong with nonaccrual loans totaling only $853,000, or 0.07% of total loans.\n  * A $1.6 million provision for credit losses was recorded in the current quarter, compared to a $200,000 recapture of provision for credit losses in the prior quarter and a $300,000 recapture of provision for credit losses in the comparable quarter in 2023.\n\n\n\nDeposits totaled $1.17 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.09 billion at June 30, 2024, and $1.21 billion at September 30, 2023. The $79.2 million increase in deposits at September 30, 2024, compared to June 30, 2024, was due primarily to a $81.9 million increase in retail certificates of deposit and a $624,000 increase in noninterest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by a $1.5 million, $1.4 million, $392,000, and $104,000 decline in interest-bearing demand deposits, money market deposits, savings and brokered deposits, respectively. The increased deposits were used to pay down our FHLB advances to $100.0 million at September 30, 2024, from $176.0 million at June 30, 2024.\n\nAdvances from the FHLB totaled $100.0 million at September 30, 2024, down from $176.0 million at June 30, 2024, and $125.0 million at September 30, 2023, as the increase in deposits during the current quarter allowed us to reduce our reliance on FHLB advances. At September 30, 2024, the $100.0 million in FHLB advances were tied to cash flow hedge agreements where the Bank pays a fixed rate and receives a variable rate in return to assist in the Bank’s interest rate risk management efforts. These cash flow hedge agreements had a weighted average remaining term of 30.8 months and a weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.93% as of September 30, 2024. The average cost of borrowings was 3.19% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.64% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 2.42% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our total deposits (unaudited):\n\n**Sep 30,****2024**| **Jun 30,****2024**| **Sep 30,****2023**| **Three****Month****Change**| **One****Year****Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nDeposits:| (Dollars in thousands)  \nNoninterest-bearing demand| $| 100,466| $| 99,842| $| 104,164| $| 624| $| (3,698| )  \nInterest-bearing demand| 55,506| 57,033| 60,816| (1,527| )| (5,310| )  \nSavings| 17,031| 17,423| 18,844| (392| )| (1,813| )  \nMoney market| 495,978| 497,345| 501,168| (1,367| )| (5,190| )  \nCertificates of deposit, retail| 447,474| 365,527| 349,446| 81,947| 98,028  \nBrokered deposits| 50,900| 51,004| 175,972| (104| )| (125,072| )  \nTotal deposits| $| 1,167,355| $| 1,088,174| $| 1,210,410| $| 79,181| $| (43,055| )  \n  \nThe following tables present an analysis of total deposits by branch office (unaudited):\n\n**September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Noninterest-bearing demand**| **Interest-bearing demand**| **Savings**| **Money market**| **Certificates of deposit, retail**| **Brokered deposits**| **Total**  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nKing County  \nRenton| $| 29,388| $| 14,153| $| 10,654| $| 305,836| $| 315,721| $| -| $| 675,752  \nLanding| 3,442| 1,660| 237| 8,348| 12,733| -| 26,420  \nWoodinville| 1,968| 2,234| 959| 8,852| 11,522| -| 25,535  \nBothell| 2,965| 1,151| 401| 1,536| 5,918| -| 11,971  \nCrossroads| 14,770| 2,039| 107| 31,665| 18,136| -| 66,717  \nKent| 5,417| 10,502| 44| 16,053| 8,562| -| 40,578  \nKirkland| 10,967| 1,890| 206| 11,243| 2,240| -| 26,546  \nIssaquah| 1,186| 294| 18| 2,547| 6,580| -| 10,625  \nTotal King County| 70,103| 33,923| 12,626| 386,080| 381,412| -| 884,144  \nSnohomish County  \nMill Creek| 3,990| 2,171| 384| 14,628| 10,312| -| 31,485  \nEdmonds| 9,254| 6,831| 330| 18,549| 13,281| -| 48,245  \nClearview| 5,587| 5,242| 1,462| 21,206| 12,251| -| 45,748  \nLake Stevens| 3,970| 4,282| 1,244| 23,257| 15,571| -| 48,324  \nSmokey Point| 2,994| 1,664| 969| 29,353| 11,387| -| 46,367  \nTotal Snohomish County| 25,795| 20,190| 4,389| 106,993| 62,802| -| 220,169  \nPierce County  \nUniversity Place| 2,940| 53| 4| 1,848| 1,458| -| 6,303  \nGig Harbor| 1,628| 1,340| 12| 1,057| 1,802| -| 5,839  \nTotal Pierce County| 4,568| 1,393| 16| 2,905| 3,260| -| 12,142  \nBrokered deposits| -| -| -| -| -| 50,900| 50,900  \nTotal deposits| $| 100,466| $| 55,506| $| 17,031| $| 495,978| $| 447,474| $| 50,900| $| 1,167,355  \n  \n**June 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Noninterest-bearing demand**| **Interest-bearing demand**| **Savings**| **Money market**| **Certificates of deposit, retail**| **Brokered deposits**| **Total**  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nKing County  \nRenton| $| 30,336| $| 14,380| $| 11,186| $| 306,176| $| 246,076| $| -| $| 608,154  \nLanding| 2,079| 566| 113| 7,895| 9,881| -| 20,534  \nWoodinville| 1,953| 2,949| 987| 10,931| 10,845| -| 27,665  \nBothell| 3,336| 847| 398| 1,595| 6,055| -| 12,231  \nCrossroads| 13,585| 2,858| 28| 25,599| 17,748| -| 59,818  \nKent| 7,729| 8,142| 42| 14,525| 7,448| -| 37,886  \nKirkland| 8,326| 1,789| 210| 15,007| 1,752| -| 27,084  \nIssaquah| 1,287| 232| 22| 3,971| 6,202| -| 11,714  \nTotal King County| 68,631| 31,763| 12,986| 385,699| 306,007| -| 805,086  \nSnohomish County  \nMill Creek| 5,823| 2,306| 420| 15,209| 9,578| -| 33,336  \nEdmonds| 10,418| 9,470| 402| 20,255| 12,753| -| 53,298  \nClearview| 4,810| 4,888| 1,444| 18,695| 9,504| -| 39,341  \nLake Stevens| 4,111| 4,445| 1,171| 22,618| 14,090| -| 46,435  \nSmokey Point| 2,700| 3,152| 982| 31,808| 10,435| -| 49,077  \nTotal Snohomish County| 27,862| 24,261| 4,419| 108,585| 56,360| -| 221,487  \nPierce County  \nUniversity Place| 2,385| 41| 2| 1,819| 1,503| -| 5,750  \nGig Harbor| 964| 968| 16| 1,242| 1,657| -| 4,847  \nTotal Pierce County| 3,349| 1,009| 18| 3,061| 3,160| -| 10,597  \nBrokered deposits| -| -| -| -| -| 51,004| 51,004  \nTotal deposits| $| 99,842| $| 57,033| $| 17,423| $| 497,345| $| 365,527| $| 51,004| $| 1,088,174  \n  \nNet loans receivable totaled $1.13 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.14 billion at June 30, 2024, and $1.17 billion at September 30, 2023. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, loan repayments outpaced new loan fundings across all loan categories except construction and land development. The average balance of net loans receivable totaled $1.13 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.14 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and $1.17 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe ACL represented 1.42% of total loans receivable at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.29% at both June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023.\n\nNonaccrual loans totaled $853,000 at September 30, 2024, compared to $4.7 million at June 30, 2024, and $201,000 at September 30, 2023. The decrease compared to the prior quarter was due primarily to the payoff of a $4.1 million commercial real estate loan that had been reported as nonaccrual as of June 30, 2024. The Bank did not incur any loss related to this credit. Additionally, there was no other real estate owned at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, or September 30, 2023.\n\nNet interest income totaled $8.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and $9.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nTotal interest income was $19.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $19.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and $19.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in total interest income during the current quarter was primarily due to interest income on interest-earning deposits held with banks which increased to $863,000 in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, up 79.0% from $482,000 in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, partially offset by decreases in interest income on loans and investments of $147,000 or 0.9% and $142,000 or 7.5%, respectively. The decrease in total interest income during the current quarter compared to the comparable quarter in 2023, was primarily due to decreases in interest income on loans of $260,000 or 1.5% and on investments of $374,000 or 17.7%, partially offset by increases in interest income on interest-earning deposits held with banks and dividends on FHLB stock of $338,000 or 64.4% and $37,000 or 32.7%, respectively.\n\nYield on loans decreased to 5.86% during the recent quarter from 5.93% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased from 5.73% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. During the June 30, 2024 quarter, the Bank modified over $130 million in loans under its agreement with Global, resulting in a $214,000 increase in net deferred loan fees and costs, which increased the loan yield. In the most recent quarter, these fees and costs decreased by $266,000. The yield on investment securities for the current quarter was 4.30%, down from 4.38% last quarter and up from 3.98% a year ago.\n\nTotal interest expense was $11.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $10.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and $10.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, was due to increases in funding costs. Interest expense on deposits increased $250,000 or 2.6% to $9.7 million, while interest expense on other borrowings increased $364,000 or 42.9% to $1.2 million during the current quarter, compared to the prior quarter. The increase in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a $32.5 million increase in the average balances of certificates of deposit, partially offset by declines of $28.9 million and $10.7 million in the average balances of brokered deposits and money market deposits, respectively. In addition, the average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.80% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, up from 3.71% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase in interest expense on other borrowings was due to a $22.4 million increase in the average balance of borrowings, coupled with a 55-basis point increase in the average cost of other borrowings to 3.19% during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior quarter. The increase in interest expense during the current quarter compared to the same quarter in 2023, was also due to increases in both the average balance and cost of outstanding borrowings, which increased by $26.1 million and 77 basis points, respectively.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.46% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.66% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 2.69% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was due primarily to continued pressure on funding costs. The average yield on interest-earning assets decreased seven basis points to 5.66% during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 5.73% during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased 20 basis points from 5.46% during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 13 basis points to 3.72% during the quarter, from 3.59% during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased 48 basis points from 3.24% during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin for the month of September 2024 was 2.49%.\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled $677,000, up slightly from $673,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and unchanged from $677,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to fluctuations related to our fintech focused venture capital investment more than offsetting the decreases in BOLI income, wealth management revenue and deposit and loan related fees in the quarter.\n\nNoninterest expense totaled $8.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.9 million for the prior quarter, and $8.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase from the June 30, 2024 quarter was primarily due to a $789,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits. This was because the June 2024 quarter included $939,000 in deferred loan costs related to loan modifications, which reduced salary and employee benefit expenses, compared to $117,000 in deferred loan costs in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Partially offsetting this was a $411,000 refund from the defined benefit plan buyout following a final census review of remaining plan participants. Professional fees also declined by $164,000 in the current quarter, largely due to a $101,000 decline in transaction-related expenses and a $54,000 decline in legal fees. Compared to the September 30, 2023 quarter, the decline in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $412,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits, a $51,000 decrease in marketing expenses, a $35,000 decline in regulatory assessments, and $10,000 in lower occupancy and equipment expense. These reductions were partially offset by higher data processing, other general and administrative expenses and professional fees.\n\nFirst Financial Northwest, Inc. is the parent company of First Financial Northwest Bank; an FDIC insured Washington State-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Renton, Washington, serving the Puget Sound Region through 15 full-service banking offices.

Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent management’s current expectations and forecasts regarding future events many of which are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, assumptions and statements about, among other things, our pending transaction with Global Federal Credit Union (“Global”) whereby Global, pursuant to the definitive purchase and assumption agreement (the “P &A Agreement”), will acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Bank, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance or financial items, perceived opportunities in the market, potential future credit experience, and statements regarding our mission and vision. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and may, therefore, involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ, possibly materially from those currently expected or projected in these forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us and could negatively affect our operating and stock performance. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or all of the parties to terminate the P&A Agreement; delays in completing the P&A Agreement; the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the Global transaction, including the P&A Agreement, on a timely basis or at all; delays or other circumstances arising from the dissolution of the Bank and the Company following completion of the P&A Agreement; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities during the pending Global transaction; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement of the Global transaction; adverse impacts to economic conditions in our local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a recession or slowed economic growth; changes in the interest rate environment, including increases or decreases in the Federal Reserve benchmark rate and duration at which such interest rate levels are maintained, which could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; the impact of inflation and the current and future monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in response thereto; the effects of any federal government shutdown; increased competitive pressures; legislative and regulatory changes; the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment; disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments, including the use of estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; the effects of climate change, severe weather events, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other public health crises, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest and other external events on our business; and other factors described in the Company’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission – that are available on our website at [www.ffnwb.com](http://www.ffnwb.com) and on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov)._\n\n_Any of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Press Release and in the other public statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made and may turn out to be wrong because of the inaccurate assumptions we might make, because of the factors illustrated above or because of other factors that we cannot foresee. Therefore, these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements._\n\nFor more information, contact:Joseph W.

Announces Receipt of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Approval for Transaction with Global Credit Union\n\nCompany Release - 8/12/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nRENTON, Wash., Aug. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Financial Northwest, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ GS: FFNW), the holding company for First Financial Northwest Bank (the “Bank”), announced today that they received the required regulatory approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) for Global Federal Credit Union (“Global”) to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities (including deposit liabilities) of the Bank (the “Asset Sale”), on the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement, dated as of January 10, 2024, by and among the Company, the Bank and Global. The Company previously announced that the Bank had received approval from the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions. The Company shareholders approved the transaction at a special meeting of shareholders held on July 19, 2024.\n\nThe consummation of the Asset Sale remains subject to Global receiving the required regulatory approval from the National Credit Union Administration (“NCUA”), which has not yet been obtained. The Company cannot provide any assurance as to whether the required final regulatory approval from the NCUA will be received, when such approval will be received, or whether there will be conditions to such approval that are unacceptably burdensome to the Company or Global.\n\nFirst Financial Northwest, Inc. is the parent company of First Financial Northwest Bank; an FDIC insured Washington State-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Renton, Washington, serving the Puget Sound Region through 15 full-service banking offices.

Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent management’s current expectations and forecasts regarding future events many of which are inherently uncertain and outside of our control. Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, assumptions and statements about, among other things, our pending transaction with Global Federal Credit Union (“Global”) whereby Global, pursuant to the definitive purchase and assumption agreement (the “P &A Agreement”), will acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Bank, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance or financial items, perceived opportunities in the market, potential future credit experience, and statements regarding our mission and vision. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and may, therefore, involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ, possibly materially from those currently expected or projected in these forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us and could negatively affect our operating and stock performance. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or all of the parties to terminate the P&A Agreement; delays in completing the P&A Agreement; the failure to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the Global transaction, including the P&A Agreement, on a timely basis or at all; delays or other circumstances arising from the dissolution of the Bank and the Company following completion of the P&A Agreement; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities during the pending Global transaction; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement of the Global transaction; potential adverse impacts to economic conditions in our local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowed economic growth; changes in the interest rate environment, including the recent increases in the Federal Reserve benchmark rate and duration at which such increased interest rate levels are maintained, which could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; the impact of continuing high inflation and the current and future monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in response thereto; the effects of any federal government shutdown; increased competitive pressures; legislative and regulatory changes; the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment; disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments, including the use of estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; the effects of climate change, severe weather events, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other public health crises, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events on our business; and other factors described in the Company’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission – that are available on our website at [www.ffnwb.com](http://www.ffnwb.com) and on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov)._\n\n_Any of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Press Release and in the other public statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made and may turn out to be wrong because of the inaccurate assumptions we might make, because of the factors illustrated above or because of other factors that we cannot foresee. Therefore, these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements._\n\nFor more information, contact:Joseph W.

Reports Net Income of $1.6 Million or $0.17 Per Diluted Share for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024\n\nCompany Release - 7/25/2024\n\n[ Download the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window) PDF 388 KB ](//s25.q4cdn.com/584312509/files/doc_news/2024/07/FFNW-Q2-2024-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nRENTON, Wash., July 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Financial Northwest, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ GS: FFNW), the holding company for First Financial Northwest Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $1.6 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million, or $(0.12) per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and net income of $1.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, net income was $480,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.6 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2023.\n\n“During the second quarter, our financial results were positively impacted by the successful completion of a project to modify a large number of loans relating to our previously announced sale of the Bank to Global Federal Credit Union. Specifically, our balance sheet contained over $250 million of loans that are ineligible for a federally chartered credit union like Global to hold due to various aspects, primarily an original term greater than 15 years for non-owner occupied residential and commercial loans. As part of our Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Global, the Bank agreed to use its good faith efforts to modify or refinance these loans. I am very pleased that the outstanding efforts of our employees resulted in the modification or refinance of over $130 million of this portfolio,” stated Joseph W. Kiley III, President and CEO.\n\n“As previously reported, our first quarter earnings were adversely impacted by the purchase of a single premium group annuity to satisfy the Company’s obligations to current and former employees covered by a legacy defined benefit plan. Extinguishing this liability at a pretax cost of $1.2 million was a strategic move considered to be an appropriate use of capital in light of the elevated rate environment. We also recognized $767,000 in pretax transaction related expenses in the first quarter of 2024, further adversely impacting our first quarter earnings. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we recognized $284,000 in pretax transaction expenses,” continued Kiley.\n\n“While nonaccrual loans increased $4.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, overall credit quality remained strong, with only $4.7 million of nonaccrual loans relative to our $1.15 billion total loan portfolio. The increase in nonaccrual loans was due primarily to a $4.1 million commercial real estate loan moving to nonaccrual in the quarter. The loan is secured by a well-collateralized mixed-use property, and as such, we do not expect to incur a loss related to this credit. The property is currently under contract to sell, and we are in the early stages of working with the purchaser to potentially allow an assumption of the existing loan. Finally, we performed an analysis of the allowance for credit losses, which considered various factors including declines in loan balances, shifts in the composition of the loan portfolio, and credit grade changes. After careful consideration, our analysis concluded that a $200,000 recapture of provision for credit losses was appropriate,” concluded Kiley.\n\nHighlights for the quarter ended June 30, 2024:\n\n  * Net loans receivable totaled $1.14 billion at June 30, 2024, down $7.8 million from the prior quarter end.\n  * Book value per share was $17.51 at June 30, 2024, compared to $17.46 at March 31, 2024, and $17.35 at June 30, 2023.\n  * Paid a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.13 per share.\n  * The Bank’s Tier 1 leverage and total capital ratios were 10.9% and 16.6% at June 30, 2024, compared to 10.4% and 16.2% at March 31, 2024, and 10.0% and 15.8% at June 30, 2023, respectively.\n  * Credit quality remained strong with nonaccrual loans totaling $4.7 million, or 0.41% of total loans.\n  * Recorded a $200,000 net recapture of provision for credit losses in the current quarter, compared to a $175,000 net recapture of provision for credit losses in the prior quarter and a $247,000 net recapture of provision for credit losses in the comparable quarter in 2023.\n\n\n\nDeposits totaled $1.09 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $1.17 billion at March 31, 2024, and $1.22 billion at June 30, 2023. The $78.7 million decline in deposits at June 30, 2024, compared to March 31, 2024, was due predominantly to a $38.2 million decrease in money market balances, $10.2 million reduction in brokered certificates of deposit and a $25.1 million decline in brokered deposits through the IntraFi Network, which was consistent with management’s strategy to reduce these higher cost deposits.\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our total deposits (unaudited):\n\n**Jun 30,****2024**| **Mar 31,****2024**| **June 30,****2023**| **Three****Month****Change**| **One****Year****Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nDeposits:| (Dollars in thousands)  \nNoninterest-bearing demand| $| 99,842| $| 100,846| $| 111,768| $| (1,004| )| $| (11,926| )  \nInterest-bearing demand| 57,033| 58,489| 89,080| (1,456| )| (32,047| )  \nSavings| 17,423| 19,314| 20,364| (1,891| )| (2,941| )  \nMoney market| 497,345| 535,594| 467,411| (38,249| )| 29,934  \nCertificates of deposit, retail| 365,527| 366,507| 359,919| (980| )| 5,608  \nBrokered deposits| 51,004| 86,146| 176,422| (35,142| )| (125,418| )  \nTotal deposits| $| 1,088,174| $| 1,166,896| $| 1,224,964| $| (78,722| )| $| (136,790| )  \n  \nThe following tables present an analysis of total deposits by branch office (unaudited):\n\n**June 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Noninterest-bearing demand**| **Interest-bearing demand**| **Savings**| **Money market**| **Certificates of deposit, retail**| **Brokered deposits**| **Total**  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nKing County  \nRenton| $|  30,336| $|  14,380| $|  11,186| $|  306,176| $|  246,076| $| -| $|  608,154  \nLanding| 2,079| 566| 113| 7,895| 9,881| -| 20,534  \nWoodinville| 1,953| 2,949| 987| 10,931| 10,845| -| 27,665  \nBothell| 3,336| 847| 398| 1,595| 6,055| -| 12,231  \nCrossroads| 13,585| 2,858| 28| 25,599| 17,748| -| 59,818  \nKent| 7,729| 8,142| 42| 14,525| 7,448| -| 37,886  \nKirkland| 8,326| 1,789| 210| 15,007| 1,752| -| 27,084  \nIssaquah| 1,287| 232| 22| 3,971| 6,202| -| 11,714  \nTotal King County| 68,631| 31,763| 12,986| 385,699| 306,007| -| 805,086  \nSnohomish County  \nMill Creek| 5,823| 2,306| 420| 15,209| 9,578| -| 33,336  \nEdmonds| 10,418| 9,470| 402| 20,255| 12,753| -| 53,298  \nClearview| 4,810| 4,888| 1,444| 18,695| 9,504| -| 39,341  \nLake Stevens| 4,111| 4,445| 1,171| 22,618| 14,090| -| 46,435  \nSmokey Point| 2,700| 3,152| 982| 31,808| 10,435| -| 49,077  \nTotal Snohomish County| 27,862| 24,261| 4,419| 108,585| 56,360| -| 221,487  \nPierce County  \nUniversity Place| 2,385| 41| 2| 1,819| 1,503| -| 5,750  \nGig Harbor| 964| 968| 16| 1,242| 1,657| -| 4,847  \nTotal Pierce County| 3,349| 1,009| 18| 3,061| 3,160| -| 10,597  \nBrokered deposits| -| -| -| -| -| 51,004| 51,004  \nTotal deposits| $|  99,842| $|  57,033| $|  17,423| $|  497,345| $|  365,527| $|  51,004| $|  1,088,174  \n  \n**March 31, 2024**  \n---  \n**Noninterest-bearing demand**| **Interest-bearing demand**| **Savings**| **Money market**| **Certificates of deposit, retail**| **Brokered deposits**| **Total**  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nKing County  \nRenton| $| 34,134| $| 17,394| $| 12,802| $|  328,526 | $| 249,288| $| -| $|  642,144  \nLanding| 3,759| 767| 98| 7,019| 9,571| -| 21,214  \nWoodinville| 2,137| 2,207| 1,011| 10,707| 10,866| -| 26,928  \nBothell| 3,025| 947| 32| 1,835| 5,158| -| 10,997  \nCrossroads| 12,007| 3,320| 35| 25,107| 17,689| -| 58,158  \nKent| 5,875| 5,579| 6| 15,046| 7,207| -| 33,713  \nKirkland| 8,804| 1,861| 155| 14,339| 2,055| -| 27,214  \nIssaquah| 1,435| 373| 113| 2,781| 6,053| -| 10,755  \nTotal King County| 71,176| 32,448| 14,252| 405,360| 307,887| -| 831,123  \nSnohomish County  \nMill Creek| 5,241| 2,327| 685| 12,600| 8,426| -| 29,279  \nEdmonds| 9,838| 9,487| 576| 29,314| 13,054| -| 62,269  \nClearview| 4,802| 4,646| 1,452| 17,701| 9,076| -| 37,677  \nLake Stevens| 3,841| 4,134| 1,165| 22,557| 14,043| -| 45,740  \nSmokey Point| 2,661| 4,415| 1,167| 45,123| 10,800| -| 64,166  \nTotal Snohomish County| 26,383| 25,009| 5,045| 127,295| 55,399| -| 239,131  \nPierce County  \nUniversity Place| 2,034| 63| 1| 1,748| 1,487| -| 5,333  \nGig Harbor| 1,253| 969| 16| 1,191| 1,734| -| 5,163  \nTotal Pierce County| 3,287| 1,032| 17| 2,939| 3,221| -| 10,496  \nBrokered deposits| -| -| -| -| -| 86,146| 86,146  \nTotal deposits| $|  100,846| $| 58,489| $|  19,314| $|  535,594| $|  366,507| $| 86,146| $|  1,166,896  \n  \nNet loans receivable totaled $1.14 billion at both June 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, down from $1.17 billion at June 30, 2023. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, loan repayments outpaced new originations across all loan categories except one-to-four family residential. The average balance of net loans receivable totaled $1.14 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.16 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $1.18 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) represented 1.29% of total loans receivable at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.30% at March 31, 2024, and 1.31% at June 30, 2023.\n\nNonaccrual loans totaled $4.7 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $201,000 at both March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023. The increase in nonaccrual loans during the quarter was due primarily to the previously mentioned $4.1 million commercial real estate loan and an additional $400,000 in consumer loans moving to nonaccrual. The commercial real estate loan is well collateralized, and no losses are anticipated on this credit. There was no other real estate owned (“OREO”) at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, or June 30, 2023.\n\nNet interest income totaled $9.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $8.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $10.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nTotal interest income was $19.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $19.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $19.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decline in total interest income during the current quarter was due to average interest-earning asset balances declining by $50.1 million and $99.8 million, respectively, compared to the prior periods. Yield on loans increased to 5.93% during the recent quarter, compared to 5.88% and 5.71% for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Bank modified over $130 million in loans in accordance with terms in its Purchase and Assumption Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Global Federal Credit Union (“Global”). Net deferred loan fees and costs recognition increased $214,000 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, due in large part to this activity, which positively impacted the yield on loans in the current quarter. Yield on investment securities was 4.38% for the current quarter, up from 4.11% and 3.93% for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively, while the average balances of investment securities declined $29.0 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to the maturity of low yielding securities in recent months.\n\nTotal interest expense was $10.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $10.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $9.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decline from the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was due primarily to lower levels of deposits, particularly the managed decrease in brokered deposits, offset slightly by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 3.71% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, up from 3.69% and 3.06% for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Advances from the FHLB totaled $176.0 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $115.0 million at March 31, 2024, and $120.0 million at June 30, 2023. The increase in FHLB advances during the current quarter was to replace the decrease in money market deposits and management’s intentional reduction in brokered deposits. At June 30, 2024, $115.0 million of our FHLB advances were tied to cash flow hedge agreements where the Bank pays a fixed rate and receives a variable rate in return to assist in the Bank’s interest rate risk management efforts. These cash flow hedge agreements had a weighted average remaining term of 29.6 months and a weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.87% as of June 30, 2024. The average cost of borrowings was 2.64% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.65% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and 2.55% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nNet interest margin was 2.66% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.55% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and 2.84% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was due primarily to the increase in net deferred loan fee recognition compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024. This activity contributed to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets of 11 basis points to 5.73% during the second quarter of 2024, from 5.62% during the first quarter of 2024, and increased 30 basis points from 5.43% during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased one basis point to 3.59% during the quarter, from 3.58% during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and increased 58 basis points from 3.01% during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The net interest margin for the month of June 2024 was 2.66%.\n\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, totaled $673,000, down from $787,000 and $798,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to fluctuations related to our fintech focused venture capital investment, a $41,000 decrease in wealth management revenue, and a $41,000 decrease in BOLI income due to timing differences, partially offset by a combined $58,000 increase in loan and deposit related fees.\n\nNoninterest expense totaled $7.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $11.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and $9.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decrease compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to a $2.9 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits, of which $1.4 million was related to the purchase of a single premium group annuity and accelerated amortization of related prepaid expense to satisfy the defined benefit liability, with no such expense in the current quarter. In addition, the aforementioned loan modification activity in the current quarter resulted in a $939,000 increase in deferred loan costs, which further decreased salaries and employee benefits expenses in the current period, along with reductions in estimates for profitability relative to targets causing in a $151,000 reduction in profit sharing contributions between quarters. Payroll taxes declined by $94,000 in the current quarter compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as seasonal annual limits were reached during the second quarter. Professional fees declined by $551,000 during the current quarter compared to the March 31, 2024 quarter, due mostly to a $489,000 decrease in professional services related to our pending transaction with Global, since the signing of the Agreement with Global and related filings occurred during the first quarter of 2024. Also contributing to the decline in professional fees was an $83,000 reduction in external audit and accounting fees in the current quarter compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The decrease compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits, a $243,000 decrease in other general and administrative expense, a $138,000 decrease in professional fees, a $97,000 decline in regulatory assessments and a $51,000 decrease in marketing expense, partially offset by higher data processing and occupancy and equipment expense.\n\nFirst Financial Northwest, Inc. is the parent company of First Financial Northwest Bank; an FDIC insured Washington State-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Renton, Washington, serving the Puget Sound Region through 15 full-service banking offices.

Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, assumptions and statements about, among other things, our pending transaction with Global Federal Credit Union (“Global”) whereby Global, pursuant to the definitive purchase and assumption agreement (the “P &A Agreement”), will acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Bank, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance or financial items, perceived opportunities in the market, potential future credit experience, and statements regarding our mission and vision. These forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations and may, therefore, involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ, possibly materially from those currently expected or projected in these forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us and could negatively affect our operating and stock performance. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the following: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the right of one or all of the parties to terminate the P&A Agreement; delays in completing the P&A Agreement; the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the Global transaction, including the P&A Agreement, on a timely basis or at all; delays or other circumstances arising from the dissolution of the Bank and the Company following completion of the P&A Agreement; diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business operations and opportunities during the pending Global transaction; potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the announcement of the Global transaction; potential adverse impacts to economic conditions in our local market areas, other markets where the Company has lending relationships, or other aspects of the Company’s business operations or financial markets, including, without limitation, as a result of employment levels, labor shortages and the effects of inflation, a potential recession or slowed economic growth; changes in the interest rate environment, including the recent increases in the Federal Reserve benchmark rate and duration at which such increased interest rate levels are maintained, which could adversely affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity; the impact of continuing high inflation and the current and future monetary policies of the Federal Reserve in response thereto; the effects of any federal government shutdown; increased competitive pressures; legislative and regulatory changes; the impact of bank failures or adverse developments at other banks and related negative press about the banking industry in general on investor and depositor sentiment; disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; effects of critical accounting policies and judgments, including the use of estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; the effects of climate change, severe weather events, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other public health crises, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events on our business; and other factors described in the Company’s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission – that are available on our website at [www.ffnwb.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sBzQ4eBWdRXbKyljPzQmBUsiY65WMQwxJMBHQGo5Wp1wsWt0xMiJAd4hP-WQg_2fGkjZhj_otzKSDSVt5ItvVA==) and on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_mVnhz_iwob6O_gW7fDb834TXXkqvaobJCuCLe97CpVymtDEFCjZvlwVrR9t5qSqb9IKUvcWbiK1lqCl02Tzhg==). _\n\n_Any of the forward-looking statements that we make in this Press Release and in the other public statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions at the time they are made and may turn out to be wrong because of the inaccurate assumptions we might make, because of the factors illustrated above or because of other factors that we cannot foresee. Therefore, these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements._\n\nFor more information, contact:Joseph W.

Business\nGeneral\nFirst Financial Northwest, Inc. (“First Financial Northwest”), a Washington corporation, was formed on June 1, 2007,\nfor the purpose of becoming the holding company for First Financial Northwest Bank (the “Bank”) in connection with the\nBank’s conversion from a mutual holding company structure to a stock holding company structure which was completed on\nOctober 9, 2007. At December 31, 2023, the Company had total assets of $1.51 billion, net loans of $1.18 billion, deposits of\n$1.19 billion and stockholders’ equity of $161.7 million. First Financial Northwest’s business activities generally are limited to\npassive investment activities and oversight of its investment in the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report,\nincluding consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank.\nThe Bank was organized in 1923 as a Washington state-chartered savings and loan association, converted to a federal\nmutual savings and loan association in 1935 and to a Washington state-chartered mutual savings bank in 1992. In 2002, the\nBank reorganized into a two-tier mutual holding company structure, became a stock savings bank, and the wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of First Financial of Renton, Inc. In connection with the 2002 conversion, the Bank changed its name to First\nSavings Bank Northwest, and then in August 2015, the Bank changed its name to First Financial Northwest Bank to better\nreflect the commercial banking services it provides beyond those typically provided by a traditional savings bank. In February\n2016, the Bank officially changed its charter from a Washington chartered stock savings bank to a Washington chartered\ncommercial bank as a way of better serving its customers’ needs.\nFirst Financial Northwest became a bank holding company, after converting from a savings and loan holding company\non March 31, 2015, and is subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board through the FRB. The change was consistent with\nthe Bank’s shift in focus from a traditional savings and loan association towards a full service, commercial bank. Additionally,\nthe Bank is examined and regulated by the DFI and by the FDIC. The Bank is required to maintain reserves at a level set by the\nFederal Reserve Board. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Des Moines, which is one of the\n11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (“FHLB System”). For additional information, see “How We are\nRegulated - Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank - Federal Home Loan Bank System.”\nThe Bank’s largest concentration of customers is in King County, with additional concentrations in Snohomish, Pierce,\nand Kitsap counties, Washington. The Bank is headquartered in Renton, in King County, where it has a full-service branch as\nwell as a smaller branch located in a commercial development known as “The Landing”. The Bank has additional branches in\nKing County located in Bellevue, Woodinville, Bothell, Kent, Kirkland, and Issaquah. In Snohomish County, Washington, the\nBank has five branches located in Mill Creek, Edmonds, Clearview, Smokey Point, and Lake Stevens. In addition, the Bank has\ntwo Pierce County, Washington branches, located in University Place and Gig Harbor. These Bank’s branches with the\nexception of its headquarters, are generally smaller branches focused on efficiency through the extensive use of the latest\nbanking technology. The Bank’s business consists of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing these funds to originate\none-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land, business and consumer loans.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 201 Wells Avenue South, Renton, Washington, 98057; our telephone\nnumber is (425) 255-4400.\nOn January 10, 2024, Global Federal Credit Union, First Financial Northwest and the Bank entered into a P&A\nAgreement, pursuant to which Global will acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities\n(including deposit liabilities) of the Bank, which we refer to herein as the asset sale, in exchange for $231.2 million in cash,\nsubject to possible downward adjustments. The asset sale is the first integral step in the sale transaction contemplated by the\nP&A Agreement, which consists of: (1) the asset sale, (2) the voluntary liquidation of the Bank and distribution of the Bank’s\nremaining assets, which will include the cash consideration paid by Global to the Bank in the asset sale, to First Financial\nNorthwest, and (3) the winding up and voluntary dissolution of First Financial Northwest and the distribution of its remaining\nassets, including the remaining net cash proceeds from the asset sale, to its shareholders.\nConsummation of the asset sale and related transactions is subject to certain conditions, including, among others,\napproval of the P&A Agreement and the related transactions by First Financial Northwest’s shareholders, the receipt of all\nrequired regulatory approvals and expiration of applicable waiting periods, accuracy of specified representations and warranties\nof each party, the performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the P&A Agreement, and the\nabsence of any injunctions or other legal restraints. The P&A Agreement provides certain termination rights for both Global\nand the Bank, and further provides that upon termination of the P&A Agreement under certain circumstances, the Bank will be\n1\nobligated to pay Global a termination fee of $9.4 million. Additional information regarding the asset sale, including the P&A\nAgreement, can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by First Financial Northwest with the SEC on January 11,\n2024.\nMarket Area\nWe consider our primary market area to be the Puget Sound Region that consists primarily of King, Snohomish, Pierce\nand, to a lesser extent, Kitsap counties. During 2023, the region experienced a slight increase in home prices on smaller sales\nvolume. The increase in mortgage rates contributed to a slowdown in demand in 2023 which led to a decline in sales. The\nnumber of homes listed for sale in King, Pierce, Snohomish and Kitsap counties at the end of 2023 decreased from the end of\n2022 with the declines ranging from 15% in Kitsap County to 47% in Snohomish County. Available inventory ranges from\n1.9 months in Pierce County to nine months in Snohomish County.\nKing County has the largest population of any county in the state of Washington and covers approximately 2,100\nsquare miles.

We focus our lending activities primarily on loans secured by commercial real estate, construction/land, first\nmortgages on one-to-four family residences, multifamily, and business lending. We offer a variety of secured consumer loans,\nincluding savings account loans, auto loans and home equity loans that include lines of credit and second mortgage term loans.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our net loan portfolio totaled $1.18 billion and represented 78.1% of our total assets.\nOur current loan policy generally limits the maximum amount of loans we can make to one borrower to 15% of the\nBank’s total capital and surplus, or $26.1 million at December 31, 2023. Exceptions to this policy are allowed only with the\napproval of the Board of Directors and if the borrower exhibits financial strength or sufficient, measurable compensating factors\nexist after consideration of the loan-to-value ratio, borrower’s financial condition, net worth, credit history, earnings capacity,\ndebt service coverage, installment obligations, and current payment history. The regulatory limit of loans we can make to one\nborrower is 20% of total capital and surplus, or $34.8 million, at December 31, 2023. At this date, our single largest lending\nrelationship, totaled $25.2 million, consisting of one commercial loan ($13.7 million) and one multifamily loan ($11.5 million),\nboth of which were performing in accordance with their terms.\nLoan Maturity and Repricing.

As of December 31, 2023, $513.2 million, or 43.1% of our total loan\nportfolio consisted of loans secured by one-to-four family residences.\nThe Bank is a traditional portfolio lender when it comes to financing residential home loans. In 2023, we originated\n$87.3 million and purchased $2.1 million in one-to-four family residential loans. The purchased loans were part of our efforts to\nincrease our portfolio of Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) qualified loans. At December 31, 2023, $284.5 million, or\n55.4% of our one-to-four family residential portfolio consisted of owner occupied loans with the remaining $228.8 million, or\n44.6% consisting of non-owner occupied loans. In addition, at December 31, 2023, $158.0 million, or 30.8% of our one-to-four\nfamily residential loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans. Substantially all of our one-to-four family residential loans\nrequire monthly principal and interest payments.\nOur fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential loans are generally originated with 15 to 30 year terms, although such\nloans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods. We also originate hybrid loans with initial fixed-rate terms\nof five to ten years that convert to variable-rate which adjusts annually thereafter. In addition, substantially all of our one-to-\nfour family residential loans contain due-on-sale clauses that allow us to declare the unpaid amount due and payable upon the\nsale of the property securing the loan. Typically, we enforce these due-on-sale clauses to the extent permitted by law and as a\nstandard course of business. The average period of time a loan is outstanding is a function of, among other factors, the level of\npurchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates, and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans.\nOur lending policy generally limits the maximum loan-to-value ratio on mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family\nresidential properties to FDIC limits. Generally, our one-to-four family loans do not exceed 80% loan-to-value based on the\nlower of the purchase price or appraised value at the time of loan origination. Properties securing our one-to-four family\nresidential loans are appraised by independent appraisers approved by us. We require the borrowers to obtain title insurance and\nif necessary, flood insurance. We generally do not require earthquake insurance due to competitive market factors.\nLoans secured by rental properties represent potentially higher risk and, as a result, we adhere to more stringent\nunderwriting guidelines. Of primary concern in non-owner occupied real estate lending is the consistency of rental income of\nthe property. Payments on loans secured by rental properties depend primarily on the tenants’ continuing ability to pay rent to\nthe property owner, the character of the borrower or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner’s\nability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, successful operation and management of\nnon-owner occupied properties, including property maintenance standards, may affect repayment. As a result, repayment of\nsuch loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We request that borrowers and loan\nguarantors, if any, provide annual financial statements, a budget factoring in a rental income cash flow analysis of the borrower\nas well as the net operating income of the property, information concerning the borrower’s expertise, credit history and\nprofitability, and the value of the underlying property. These loans are generally secured by a first mortgage on the underlying\ncollateral property along with an assignment of rents and leases. If the borrower has multiple rental property loans with us, the\nloans are typically not cross-collateralized. As of December 31, 2023, there were no nonaccrual one-to-four family loans.\nHowever, at that date, we did have two one-to-four family loans totaling $317,000, which were 90 days or more past due.\nDespite their overdue status, both loans well collateralized and no loss was expected by the Bank on these loans.\nMultifamily and Commercial Real Estate Lending. As of December 31, 2023, $138.1 million, or 11.6% of our total\nloan portfolio was secured by multifamily properties and $377.9 million, or 31.6% of our loan portfolio was secured by\ncommercial real estate properties. Our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by retail shopping centers, office\nbuildings, hotels or motels, mini-storage facilities, mobile home parks, warehouses, and nursing homes. Commercial real estate\nand multifamily loans are subject to similar underwriting standards and processes. These loans are viewed primarily as cash\nflow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate.\nTypically, multifamily and commercial real estate loans have higher balances, are more complex to evaluate and\nmonitor, and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four-family residential loans. In an attempt to compensate for and\nmitigate this risk, these loans are generally priced at higher interest rates than one-to-four family residential loans and generally\nhave a maximum LTV of 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price. We generally require loan guarantees by\nany parties with a property ownership interest of 20% or more. If the borrower is a corporation or partnership, we generally\nrequire personal guarantees from the principals based upon a review of their personal financial statements and individual credit\nreports.\n5\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our multifamily and commercial real estate loan portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2023, and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n% of Total in % of Total in\nAmount Portfolio Amount Portfolio\n(Dollars in thousands)\nMultifamily real estate:\nTotal multifamily $ 138,149 100.0 % $ 126,866 100.0 %\nCommercial real estate:\nRetail $ 124,172 32.9 % $ 132,917 32.5 %\nOffice 72,778 19.3 84,301 20.7\nHotel / motel 63,597 16.8 55,408 13.6\nStorage 33,033 8.7 33,797 8.3\nMobile home park 21,701 5.7 25,283 6.2\nWarehouse 19,218 5.1 19,917 4.9\nNursing home 11,610 3.1 12,348 3.0\nOther non-residential 31,750 8.4 43,933 10.8\nTotal non-residential $ 377,859 100.0 % $ 407,904 100.0 %\nThe average loan size in our multifamily and commercial real estate loan portfolios was $987,000 and $2.1 million,\nrespectively, as of December 31, 2023. At this date, $34.9 million, or 25.2% of our multifamily loans and $100.1 million, or\n26.5% of our commercial real estate loans were located outside of the Puget Sound Region. We currently target individual\nmultifamily and commercial real estate loans between $1.0 million and $5.0 million. The largest multifamily loan as of\nDecember 31, 2023, was a 79-unit apartment complex with a net outstanding principal balance of $15.9 million located in King\nCounty, Washington, which was performing in accordance with its loan repayment terms at that date. As of December 31,\n2023, the largest commercial real estate loan had a net outstanding balance of $15.1 million that was secured by a retail facility\nlocated in King County, Washington, which was performing in accordance with its loan repayment terms at that date.\nThe credit risk related to multifamily and commercial real estate loans is considered to be greater than the risk related\nto one-to-four family residential loans because the repayment of multifamily and commercial real estate loans typically is\ndependent on the income stream from the real estate securing the loan as collateral and the successful operation of the\nborrower’s business, that can be significantly affected by adverse conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy. For\nexample, if the cash flow from the borrower’s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrower’s\nability to repay the loan may be impaired. In addition, many of our multifamily and commercial real estate loans are not fully\namortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. These balloon payments generally require the borrower to either\nrefinance or occasionally sell the underlying property in order to make the balloon payment.\nIf we foreclose on a multifamily or commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer\nthan for one-to-four family residential mortgage loan foreclosures because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral.\nOur multifamily and commercial real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups\nof borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our multifamily or commercial real estate\nloans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred in our one-to-four family residential or\nconsumer loan portfolios. There were no commercial real estate loans or multifamily loans on nonaccrual status at both\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. In addition, there were no multifamily or commercial real estate loans charged-off during the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nConstruction/Land Loans. We originate construction/land loans primarily to residential builders for the construction\nof single-family residences, condominiums, townhouses, multifamily properties and residential developments located in our\nmarket area. Land loans include land non-development loans for the purchase or refinance of unimproved land held for future\nresidential development, improved residential lots held for speculative investment purposes or lines of credit secured by land,\nand land development loans. Construction/land loans to builders generally require the borrower to have an existing relationship\nwith the Company and a proven record of successful projects. At December 31, 2023, our total construction/land loans\ndecreased to $60.9 million or 5.1% of our total loan portfolio, from $77.6 million, or 6.6% of our total loans, at\n6\nDecember 31, 2022, as a result of $15.4 million of multifamily construction/land loans converting to permanent multifamily\nloans. The Company’s lending policy sets forth the guideline that the balance of our net acquisition, development, and\nconstruction loans and deferred fees and costs, not exceed 100% of the Bank’s total capital plus surplus. The Company was in\ncompliance with this policy at December 31, 2023, with a balance equal to 38.3% of the Bank’s total capital plus surplus.\nManagement intends to maintain levels near or below this guideline, however the uncertainty of the timing associated with\nconstruction loan draws occasionally results in the actual concentration exceeding the guideline. There were no construction/\nland loans classified as nonaccrual at December 31, 2023 and 2022. There were no construction/land loan charge-offs during\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. At December 31, 2023, the loans in process (“LIP”) balance on construction/land\nloans was $44.6 million.\nFollowing is the composition of our total construction/land loan portfolio, that are net of LIP, at the dates indicated.\nAll of the loans represented were performing:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nConstruction speculative:\nOne-to-four family residential $ 47,149 $ 52,492\nTotal construction speculative 47,149 52,492\nConstruction permanent: (1)\nMultifamily 4,004 15,393\nTotal construction permanent 4,004 15,393\nLand:\nLand development 4,774 3,980\nLand non-development 4,997 5,779\nTotal land 9,771 9,759\nTotal construction/land loans $ 60,924 $ 77,644\n_____________\n(1) Includes loans where the builder does not intend to sell the property after the construction phase is completed.\nThe following table includes construction/land loans by county at December 31, 2023:\nPercent of Construction/\nCounty Loan Balance Land Loan Balance\n(Dollars in thousands)\nKing $ 59,438 97.5 %\nSnohomish 534 0.9\nOther Washington counties 952 1.6\nTotal $ 60,924 100.0 %\nLoans to finance the construction of single-family homes, subdivisions and land loans are generally offered to builders\nin our primary market areas. Loans that are termed “speculative” are those where the builder does not have, at the time of loan\norigination, a signed contract with a buyer for the home or lot who has a commitment for permanent financing with either us or\nanother lender. The buyer may be identified either during or after the construction period, with the risk that the builder may\nhave to fund the debt service on the speculative loan along with real estate taxes and other carrying costs for the project for a\nsignificant period of time after completion of the project until a buyer is identified. The maximum LTV ratio applicable to these\nloans is generally 100% of the actual cost of construction, provided that the LTV on the completed project does not exceed\n80%, with approval required from the Chief Credit Officer (“CCO”) for LTV ratios over 80%. In addition, a minimum of 20%\nverified equity is generally also required. Verified equity refers to cash equity invested in the project. Development plans are\nrequired from builders prior to committing to the loan. We require that builders maintain adequate title insurance and other\nappropriate insurance coverage, and, if applicable, appropriate environmental data report(s) that the land is free of hazardous or\ntoxic waste. While maturity dates for residential construction loans are largely a function of the estimated construction period of\nthe project and typically do not exceed one year, land loans generally are for 12 to 18 months. Substantially all of our\nresidential construction loans have adjustable-rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate. During the term of\n7\nconstruction, the accumulated interest on the loan is either added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve or billed\nmonthly. At December 31, 2023, there was no interest reserve included in the LIP balance on construction/land loans. At\nDecember 31, 2022, the LIP balance on construction/land loans included $5.2 million set aside for interest reserves. When these\nloans exhaust their original reserves set up at origination, no additional reserves are permitted unless the loan is re-analyzed and\nit is determined that the additional reserves are appropriate, based on the updated analysis. Construction loan proceeds are\ndisbursed periodically as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. At December 31,\n2023, our three largest construction/land loans consisted of multifamily, land development and one-to-four family residential\nloans of $4.0 million, $4.8 million, and $4.8 million, respectively, all of which properties are located in King County. The\n$4.0 million multifamily loan will rollover to a permanent loan upon completion of the construction period.\nCertain of our residential construction loans to borrowers for one-to-four family, non-owner occupied residences are\nstructured to be converted to fixed-rate permanent loans at the end of the construction phase with one closing for both the\nconstruction loan and the permanent financing. Prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an\nappraisal of the post-construction value of the project by an independent appraiser. During the construction phase, which may\nlast 12 to 24 months, an approved inspector or designated Bank employee makes periodic inspections of the construction site to\ncertify construction has reached the stated percentage of completion. Typically, disbursements are made in monthly draws and\ninterest-only payments are required. At December 31, 2023, there were no residential construction loans which will rollover to\npermanent loans with the Bank at the completion of the construction phase.\nWe also make construction loans for commercial development projects. The projects include multifamily, retail, office,\nwarehouse, hotels and office buildings. These loans typically have an interest-only payment phase during construction and\ngenerally convert to permanent financing when construction is complete. Disbursement of funds is at our sole discretion and is\nbased on the progress of construction. The Bank uses an independent third party or Bank employee to conduct monthly\ninspections to certify that construction has reached the stated percentage of completion and that previous disbursements are\nreflected in the degree of work performed to date. Generally, the maximum LTV ratio applicable to these loans is 90% of the\nactual cost of construction or 80% of the prospective value at completion.\nLand development loans are generally made to builders for preparation of a building site and do not include the\nconstruction of buildings on the property. The maximum LTV for these loans is 75% based on the lower of the purchase price\nor appraised value at the time of loan origination. Land non-development loans are generally for raw land where we do not\nfinance the cost of preparing the site for building and are subject to a maximum LTV ratio of 65% based on the lower of the\npurchase price or appraised value at the time of loan origination.\nOur construction/land loans are based upon estimates of costs in relation to values associated with the completed\nproject. Construction/land lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds\nare advanced upon the collateral for the project based on an estimate of costs that will produce a future value at completion.\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, time needed to complete the building phase, as well as\nthe market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to\nevaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project LTV ratio. Changes in the demand\nfor new housing, longer completion times due to supply chain issues, and higher than anticipated building costs may cause\nactual results to vary significantly from those estimated. For these reasons, this type of lending also typically involves higher\nloan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. These loans often involve the disbursement\nof funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or\nlease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal\nand interest. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for\nthe repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because construction loans\nrequire active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more\ndifficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans\nby rapidly increasing the end-purchasers’ borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties\nunder construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold, which also\ncomplicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or\ncontract with another builder to complete construction. Furthermore, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the\nadded risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. Land loans also pose additional risk because of\nthe lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can also be\nsignificantly influenced by supply and demand conditions.\nBusiness Lending. Business loans totaled $29.1 million, or 2.5% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2023. The\nCompany participated in the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a guaranteed\n8\nunsecured loan program enacted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 to provide near-term\nrelief to help small businesses impacted by COVID-19 sustain operations. The PPP began in 2020 and ended on May 31, 2021.\nUnder this program we funded 723 applications totaling $77.7 million of loans in our market areas and began processing\napplications for loan forgiveness in the fourth quarter of 2020. At December 31, 2023, there were five PPP loans outstanding\ntotaling $473,000, as compared to the same loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $783,000 at December 31, 2022.\nThe Company also originates loans under other SBA lending programs, which are partially guaranteed by the SBA. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the Bank’s portfolio included $1.8 million of these SBA loans, of which $1.3 million is guaranteed by the\nSBA. At that date, these SBA loans were not held for sale, however, the Company may elect to sell off the guaranteed portion\nof these loans in the future.\nConventional business loans (loans other than PPP loans) are generally secured by business equipment, accounts\nreceivable, inventory or other property. Loan terms typically vary from one to five years. The interest rates on such loans are\neither fixed-rate or adjustable-rate. The interest rates for the adjustable-rate loans are indexed to the prime rate published in The\nWall Street Journal plus a margin. Our business lending policy includes credit file documentation and requires analysis of the\nborrower’s background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower’s capital and collateral, as well as an\nevaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower’s past, present and future cash flows is also an\nimportant aspect of our credit analysis. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our conventional business loans. The largest\nconventional business loan had an outstanding balance of $14.4 million at December 31, 2023 and was performing according to\nits repayment terms. At December 31, 2023, we did not have any business loans delinquent in excess of 90 days or in\nnonaccrual status.\nAircraft loans are collateralized by new or used, single-engine piston aircraft to light jets for business or personal use.\nThese loans generally range in size from $250,000 to $3.0 million with the primary focus of our underwriting guidelines on the\nasset value of the collateral rather than the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s\naircraft loan portfolio consisted of one loan with an outstanding balance of $1.9 million, representing 6.7% of total business\nloans. See Item 1A. Risk Factors- “Risks Related to Our Lending - We engage in aircraft and classic and collectible car\nfinancing transactions, in which high-value collateral is susceptible to potential catastrophic loss. If any of these transactions\nbecomes nonperforming, we could suffer a loss on some or all of our value in the assets.”\nRepayments of conventional business loans are often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be\nunpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our business loans, other than aircraft and PPP\nloans, are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral\nprovided by the borrower. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is\nbased on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, in the case of\nloans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent\non the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing business loans may depreciate\nover time, may be difficult to appraise, or may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\nConsumer Lending. We offer a limited variety of consumer loans to our customers, consisting primarily of home\nequity loans and savings account loans. Generally, consumer loans have shorter terms to maturity and higher interest rates than\none-to-four family residential loans. Consumer loans are offered with both fixed and adjustable interest rates and with varying\nterms. At December 31, 2023, consumer loans were $72.0 million or 6.1% of the total loan portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2023, the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio consisted of purchased indirect consumer\nloans to finance classic and collectible cars with a balance of $58.6 million, or 81.4% of the total consumer loan portfolio. Due\nto the unique nature of these cars, the estimated value often does not align with listed values, therefore, approval of the loan is\nbased on the borrower’s ability to repay. These fixed rate loans typically have maturity periods of three to fifteen years.\nIncluded in these loans are classic cars, defined as a vehicle in excess of 25 years old, and collectible cars, with a retail price in\nexcess of $150,000. The current internal portfolio limit for these loans is $60.0 million, and as of December 31, 2023, the\nportfolio balance was $58.6 million. At that date, our largest classic and collectible car loan was $761,000 and the average loan\nsize was $85,000. See Item 1A. Risk Factors- “Risks Related to Our Lending - We engage in aircraft and classic and collectible\ncar financing transactions, in which high-value collateral is susceptible to potential catastrophic loss. If any of these transactions\nbecomes nonperforming, we could suffer a loss on some or all of our value in the assets.”\nAt December 31, 2023, home equity loans, primarily home equity lines of credit totaled $12.5 million, or 17.3% of the\ntotal consumer loan portfolio. The home equity lines of credit include $3.3 million of equity lines of credit in first lien position\nand $9.2 million of second liens on residential properties. At December 31, 2023, unfunded commitments on our home equity\nlines of credit totaled $21.4 million. Home equity loans are made for purposes such as the improvement of residential\n9\nproperties, debt consolidation and education expenses. At origination, the LTV ratio is generally 90% or less, when taking into\naccount both the balance of the home equity loans and the first mortgage loan. Home equity loans are originated on a fixed-rate\nor adjustable-rate basis. The interest rate for the adjustable-rate second lien loans is indexed to the prime rate published in The\nWall Street Journal and may include a margin. Home equity loans generally have a 10 to 30 year term, with a 10 year draw\nperiod, and either convert to principal and interest payments with no further draws or require a balloon payment due at maturity.\nConsumer loans entail greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of\nconsumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a\ndefaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the\ngreater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further collection efforts\nagainst the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the\nborrower’s continuing financial stability and are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal\nbankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and\ninsolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. Classic and collectible car loans have greater risk\nthan other consumer loans primarily due to their high value which may fluctuate significantly. Home equity lines of credit have\ngreater credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because they are generally secured by mortgages\nsubordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property that we may or may not hold in our portfolio. We do not have private\nmortgage insurance coverage on these loans. Adjustable-rate loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest\nrate environment due to the increase in payment amounts when interest rates reset higher. If current economic conditions\ndeteriorate for our borrowers and their home prices fall, we may also experience higher credit losses from this loan portfolio.\nFor our home equity loans that are in a second lien position, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering our entire\nloan principal outstanding in the event of a default. At December 31, 2023, $220,000 of classic and collectible auto loans were\nin nonaccrual status. During the year ended December 31, 2023, $22,000 of consumer loans were charged off.\nLoan Solicitation and Processing. Our consumer and residential mortgage loan originations are generated through\nthe Bank and from time to time through outside brokers and correspondent relationships we have established with select\nmortgage companies or other financial institutions. We originate multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land and\nbusiness loans primarily using the Bank’s loan officers, with referrals coming from builders, brokers and existing customers.\nUpon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower, we obtain a credit report and other data to verify\nspecific information relating to the loan applicant’s employment, income, and credit standing. All real estate loans requiring an\nappraisal are done by our internal appraisal department or an independent third-party appraiser. All appraisers are approved by\nus, and their credentials are reviewed annually, as is the quality of their appraisals.\nWe use a multi-level underwriting matrix which establishes lending targets and tolerance levels depending on the loan\ntype being approved. The matrix also sets minimum credit standards and approval limits for each of the loan types.\nLending Authority. The Directors’ Loan Committee consists of at least three members of the Board of Directors. The\nDirectors’ Loan Committee recommends for approval by the Board of Directors exceptions to the aggregate loan limit to one\nborrower of 15% of total capital plus surplus, or $26.1 million at December 31, 2023. The Board of Directors approves\nexceptions to such aggregate loan limit to one borrower up to 20% of total capital plus surplus, or $34.8 million at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOfficer Lending Authority. Individual signing authority has been delegated to two lending officers. Our Senior Credit\nApproval Officer (“SCAO”) has authority from the Board of Directors to approve loans and aggregate relationships up to and\nincluding $8.0 million. The Board of Directors has given our CCO authority to approve credit to one borrower not to exceed the\nlegal lending limit of 20% of total capital plus surplus.\nLoan Originations, Servicing, Purchases, Sales and Repayments. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, our total loan originations and purchases were $203.2 million, $321.4 million and $363.0 million, respectively.\nOne-to-four family residential loans are generally originated in accordance with FDIC guidelines, with the exception\nof our special community development loans originated to satisfy compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Our\nloans are underwritten by designated real estate loan underwriters internally in accordance with standards as provided by our\nBoard-approved loan policy. We require title insurance on all loans and fire and casualty insurance on all secured loans and\nhome equity loans where real estate serves as collateral. Flood insurance is also required on all secured loans when the real\nestate is located in a flood zone.\n10\nThe following table shows total loans originated, purchased, repaid and other changes during the years indicated.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nLoan originations:\nReal estate:\nOne-to-four family residential $ 87,283 $ 160,290 $ 124,220\nMultifamily 4,365 8,287 20,976\nCommercial 22,076 38,580 62,552\nConstruction/land 51,790 55,524 72,825\nTotal real estate 165,514 262,681 280,573\nBusiness (1) 2,201 2,567 26,029\nConsumer 13,441 6,155 1,852\nTotal loans originated 181,156 271,403 308,454\nLoan purchases and participations:\nOne-to-four family residential 2,107 4,042 1,665\nMultifamily 80 12 251\nCommercial — 9,073 32,374\nBusiness — 5,000 —\nConsumer 19,832 31,834 20,290\nTotal loan purchases and participations (2) 22,019 49,961 54,580\nPrincipal repayments (191,201) (258,706) (342,945)\nCharge-offs (22) (37) —\nChange in LIP (3,189) 2,000 (16,457)\nChange in net deferred (costs) fees, and ACL/ALLL 79 (999) (753)\nNet increase (decrease) in loans $ 8,842 $ 63,622 $ 2,879\n_______________\n(1) Includes $25.6 million in PPP loans originated during 2021. PPP expired on May 31, 2021.\n(2) Totals include $80,000, $9.4 million and $8.2 million in loan participations during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLoan Origination and Other Fees. In some instances, we receive loan origination fees on real estate-related products.\nLoan fees generally represent a percentage of the principal amount of the loan and are paid by the borrower. The amount of fees\ncharged to the borrower on one-to-four family residential loans and multifamily and commercial real estate loans typically\nrange from 0% to 2%. United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) require that certain fees received, net\nof certain origination costs, be deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan. Net deferred fees or costs associated\nwith loans that are prepaid or sold are recognized in income at the time of prepayment or sale. We had $262,000 of net deferred\nloan costs at December 31, 2023, and net deferred loan fees of $151,000 at December 31, 2022.\nLoan purchases generally include a premium, which is deferred and amortized into interest income with net deferred\nfees over the contractual life of the loan. During 2023, total premiums of $876,000, or 4.0% of the purchased principal, were\npaid on purchased loans. In comparison, premiums of $1.4 million, or 3.5% of the purchased principal, were paid on purchased\nloans during 2022.\nOne-to-four family residential and consumer loans are generally originated without a prepayment penalty. However,\nthe majority of our one-to-four family residential loans held in the name of an entity, and multifamily and commercial real\nestate loans have prepayment penalties associated with the loans. Most of the multifamily and commercial real estate loan\noriginations with interest rates fixed for the first five years will adjust thereafter and have a prepayment penalty of 2% to 3% of\nthe principal balance in year one, with decreasing penalties in subsequent years. Longer initial fixed rate terms generally have\ncorrespondingly longer prepayment penalty periods.\n11\nAsset Quality\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $1.4 million of loans past due 30 days or more. These loans represented 0.12% of\ntotal loans receivable. We generally assess late fees or penalty charges on delinquent loans of up to 5.0% of the monthly\npayment. The borrower is given up to a 15 day grace period from the due date to make the loan payment.\nThe Company actively manages delinquent loans and nonperforming assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of\ndebts and marketing saleable properties we foreclosed or repossessed, work-outs of classified assets and loan charge-offs. We\nhandle collection procedures internally or with the assistance of outside legal counsel. Late charges are incurred when the loan\nexceeds 10 to 15 days past due depending upon the loan product. When a delinquent loan is identified, corrective action takes\nplace immediately. The first course of action is to determine the cause of the delinquency and seek cooperation from the\nborrower in resolving the issue. Additional corrective action, if required, will vary depending on the borrower, the collateral, if\nany, and whether the loan requires specific handling procedures as required by the Washington State Deed of Trust Act. If the\nborrower is chronically delinquent and all reasonable means of obtaining payments have been exhausted, we will seek to\nforeclose on the collateral securing the loan according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law.\nConstruction/land, commercial real estate, and multifamily loans generally have larger individual loan amounts that\nhave a greater single impact on asset quality in the event of delinquency or default.\nWhen a loan becomes 90 days past due, we generally place the loan on nonaccrual status unless the credit is well\nsecured and/or in the process of collection. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to being 90 days past due if there is\nan identified problem such as an impending foreclosure or bankruptcy or if the borrower is unable to meet their scheduled\npayment obligations. Nonaccrual loans were $220,000 and $193,000 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther Real Estate Owned. Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is\nclassified as OREO until it is sold. When the property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of its cost or fair market value of\nthe property, less selling costs. The Bank had no OREO properties at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. In the future, we may\nexperience foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and short sale activity while we work with our nonperforming loan\ncustomers to minimize our loss exposure.\nBecause of our structure, we believe we are able to make decisions regarding offers on OREO and the real estate\nunderlying our nonperforming loans very quickly compared to larger institutions where decisions could take six to twelve\nmonths. This distinction has historically worked to our benefit in reducing our nonperforming assets and disposing of OREO.\nModifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty. Modifications of loans are made in the ordinary\ncourse of business and are completed on a case-by-case basis through negotiation with the borrower in connection with the loan\ncollection processes. Loan modifications are made to provide borrowers payment relief. Effective January 1, 2023, the\nCompany adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated accounting guidance for trouble debt restructurings while requiring\ndisclosures of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for modifications related to principal reductions, interest rate\nreductions, term extensions, and more than insignificant payment delay.\nFrom time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases,\nthese modifications may result in new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficult may be in the\nform of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, and other-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension or a\ncombination thereof, among other things. At December 31, 2023, we did not have any loans that were experiencing financial\ndifficulty and were also modified during the year.\nClassified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets as\nsubstandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and\npayment capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct\npossibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the\nweaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or\nliquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Assets\nclassified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the\nestablishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.\n12\nWhen we classify problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance in an\namount we deem prudent. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent\nrisk associated with lending activities, but unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem\nassets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge-off those assets in the period in\nwhich they are deemed uncollectible. Our determinations as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation\nallowances are subject to review by the FDIC and the DFI that can order the establishment of additional loss allowances or the\ncharge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves. Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant\nclassification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention. At\nDecember 31, 2023, special mention loans decreased to $130,000, down from $5.9 million at December 31, 2022, due to the\nupgrade of a $500,000 one-to-four family residential loan, the payoff of a $4.7 million commercial loan and a $200,000\nconsumer loan and the downgrade of a $293,000 one-to-four family loan from special mention to substandard. At December 31,\n2023, all special mention loans were current on their payments and were in compliance with their original loan terms.\nIn connection with the filing of periodic reports with the FDIC and in accordance with our loan policy, we regularly\nreview the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable\nregulations. The decrease in our classified loans during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to principal\npaydowns, partially offset by a downgrade of a $293,000 one-to-four family loan from special mention to substandard.\nSubstandard loans that were individually evaluated for credit losses at December 31, 2023, resulted in an $11,000 addition to\nACL for the expected loss related to consumer loans.\nClassified loans consisting solely of substandard loans, were as follows at the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nOne-to-four family residential $ 293 $ —\nMultifamily 1,590 1,630\nCommercial real estate 44,020 45,411\nConsumer 220 201\nTotal classified loans $ 46,123 $ 47,242\nAllowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”). Management recognizes the possibility of loan losses throughout a loan’s\nlifespan and emphasizes the need to maintain the ACL at a level sufficient to absorb specific losses related to collateral-\ndependent loans and expected losses within the loan portfolio. Our methodology for analyzing the ACL comprises two\ncomponents: the general allowance and the specific allowance. The general allowance establishes a reserve rate using historical\nlife-of-loan default rates, current loan portfolio information, economic forecasts, and business cycle data. Statistical analysis\ndetermines life-of-loan default and loss rates for the quantitative component, while qualitative factors (“Q-Factors”) adjust\nexpected loss rates for current and forecasted conditions. The Q-Factor methodology involves a blend of quantitative analysis\nand management judgment, reviewed quarterly.\nSpecific allowances arise when individual loans exhibit unique risk characteristics, leading to an impairment\nanalysis. If management believes that scheduled principal and interest payments will not be fully paid, and the recorded\ninvestment is less than the market value of the collateral, a specific reserve is established in the ACL for the loan. The specific\nreserve amount is calculated using current appraisals, listed sales prices, and other available information. This analysis is\nsubject to inherent subjectivity, relying on estimates that may be revised as more information becomes available. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the individually evaluated loan balances were $45.9 million and $48.5 million, respectively.\nThe Board of Directors’ Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends ACL approval or any provision/\nrecapture of provision for credit losses quarterly. The Board approves the provision or recapture based on the Committee’s\nrecommendation. The ACL increases with the provision for credit losses, impacting current period earnings. If the loan\nportfolio analysis indicates a lower risk than the ACL balance, a recapture of provision for credit losses is added to current\nperiod earnings.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, there was a $208,000 recapture of provision for credit losses, compared to a\n$434,000 recapture for the year ended December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to credit upgrades, payoffs of higher credit\nrisk loans, updates to economic forecasts, changes in loan portfolio balances, composition, and characteristics. As of\n13\nDecember 31, 2023, the ACL was $15.3 million or 1.28% of total loans, compared to $15.2 million or 1.29% at December 31,\n2022. The ACL’s level is based on estimates, and actual losses may vary. Management reviews ACL adequacy quarterly.\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of the ACL by loan category, at the dates indicated.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nPercent Percent Percent\nof of of\nAllowance Loans Allowance Loans Allowance Loans\nLoan by Loan to Total Loan by Loan to Total Loan by Loan to Total\nBalance Category Loans Balance Category Loans Balance Category Loans\nReal estate: (Dollars in thousands)\nOne-to-four\nfamily\nresidential $ 513,223 $ 5,747 43.1 % $ 474,180 $ 4,043 40.1 % $ 383,721 $ 3,214 34.3 %\nMultifamily 138,149 1,509 11.6 126,866 1,210 10.7 130,150 1,279 11.6\nCommercial real\nestate 377,859 3,895 31.6 407,904 5,397 34.5 419,708 6,615 37.6\nConstruction/\nland 60,924 1,856 5.1 77,644 1,717 6.6 92,843 2,064 8.3\nTotal real estate 1,090,155 13,007 91.4 1,086,594 12,367 91.9 1,026,422 13,172 91.8\nBusiness 29,081 387 2.5 31,363 948 2.7 46,333 1,112 4.1\nConsumer 71,995 1,912 6.1 64,353 1,912 5.4 46,363 1,373 4.1\nTotal $ 1,191,231 $ 15,306 100.0 % $ 1,182,310 $ 15,227 100.0 % $ 1,119,118 $ 15,657 100.0 %\nBased on its comprehensive analysis, management believes that the ACL as of December 31, 2023 was adequate to\nabsorb the estimated lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our\ndetermination of the adequacy of the ACL are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will be\nproven correct in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that\nany increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future\nadditions to the ACL may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business\nconditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In\naddition, the determination of the amount of the ACL is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination\nprocess that may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established\nloss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. A weakening in the\nnational and local economic conditions or other factors, could result in a material increase in the ACL and may adversely affect\nthe Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\n14\nThe following table shows certain credit ratios at and for the periods indicated and each component of the ratio’s\ncalculations. The Company adopted the CECL methodology as of January 1, 2023. All amounts prior to January 1, 2023 were\ncalculated using the previous incurred loss methodology to compute our allowance for loan losses, which is not directly\ncomparable to the new current expected credit losses methodology.\nAt or For the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nACL/ALLL as a percent of total loans 1.28 % 1.29 % 1.40 %\nACL/ALLL at period end $ 15,306 $ 15,227 $ 15,657\nTotal loans outstanding 1,191,231 1,182,310 1,119,118\nNon-accrual loans as a percentage of total loans outstanding at period end 0.02 % 0.02 % — %\nTotal non-accrual loans $ 220 $ 193 $ —\nTotal loans outstanding 1,191,231 1,182,310 1,119,118\nACL/ALLL as a percent of non-accrual loans at period end 6,957.27 % 7,889.78% n/a\nACL/ALLL at period end $ 15,306 $ 15,227 $ 15,657\nTotal non-accrual loans 220 193 —\nNet recoveries (charge-offs) during period to average loans outstanding:\nOne-to-four family residential: — % — % 0.05%\nNet recoveries during period $ 1 $ 7 $ 183\nAverage loans receivable, net (1) 483,344 427,455 374,796\nMultifamily: — % — % — %\nNet charge-offs during period $ — $ — $ —\nAverage loans receivable, net (1) 139,470 132,845 139,298\nCommercial: — % — % — %\nNet charge-offs during period $ — $ — $ —\nAverage loans receivable, net (1) 393,382 408,688 382,341\nConstruction/land development: — % — % — %\nNet charge-offs during period $ — $ — $ —\nAverage loans receivable, net (1) 59,054 74,438 97,494\nBusiness: — % — % — %\nNet charge-offs during period $ — $ — $ —\nAverage loans receivable, net (1) 28,302 32,539 63,263\nConsumer: (0.03) % (0.07) % — %\nNet charge-offs during period $ (22) $ (37) $ —\nAverage loans receivable, net (1) 69,017 52,870 41,580\nTotal loans: — % — % 0.02 %\nNet (charge-offs) recoveries during period $ (21) $ (30) $ 183\nAverage loans receivable, net (1) 1,172,569 1,128,835 1,098,772\n_______________\n(1) The average loans receivable, net balances, include nonaccrual loans and deferred loan (costs) fees.\n15\nInvestment Activities\nGeneral. Under Washington State law, commercial banks are permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets,\nincluding, but not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of\ninsured banks and savings institutions, banker’s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper,\ninvestment grade corporate debt securities, and obligations of states and their political sub-divisions.\nThe Investment, Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial\nOfficer, and Controller of the Bank, along with other members of management and the Board of Directors, holds the authority\nand responsibility to manage our investment policy. This includes monitoring portfolio strategies and recommending necessary\nchanges to the Board of Directors. Monthly, management provides the Board with a summary of investment holdings, along\nwith respective market values, and details of all purchases and sales of investment securities.\nThe Chief Financial Officer has the primary responsibility for managing the investment portfolio and considers various\nfactors when making decisions, such as marketability, maturity, liquidity, and tax consequences of proposed investments. The\nmaturity structure of investments is affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the\nyield curve, interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and\nloan originations and purchases.\nThe general objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in\nmaintaining earnings when loan demand is low, and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit\nrisk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.\nAt December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio consisted principally of mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds,\nU.S. government agency obligations, and corporate bonds. From time to time, investment levels may increase or decrease\ndepending upon yields available on investment opportunities and management’s projected demand for funds for loan\noriginations, net deposit flows, and other activities. The Bank held three annuity contracts, totaling $2.5 million and\n$2.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, as held-to-maturity investments. These annuity contracts were\npurchased to satisfy the benefit obligation associated with certain supplemental executive retirement plan agreements.\nMortgage-Backed Securities. The mortgage-backed securities in our portfolio were primarily comprised of Fannie\nMae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae issued mortgage-backed securities, all which were classified as available-for-sale. These\nissuers guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest in the event of default. At December 31, 2023, our available-for-\nsale mortgage-backed securities portfolio included other “private label” mortgage-backed securities with a fair value of\n$29.2 million and an amortized cost of $30.6 million. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of\n4.00% at December 31, 2023.\nU.S. Government Agency Obligations. The agency securities in our portfolio were comprised of Fannie Mae,\nFreddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, SBA and FHLB agency securities. These issuers guarantee the timely payment of principal and\ninterest in the event of default. At December 31, 2023, the portfolio of government agency securities had a weighted-average\nyield of 3.94%.\nThe guarantees of the SBA, as a U.S. government agency and Ginnie Mae, as part of a U.S. government agency are\nbacked by the full faith and credit of the United States. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks are U.S.\ngovernment-sponsored entities. Although their guarantees are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, they\nmay borrow from the U.S. Treasury, which has taken other steps to ensure these U.S. government-sponsored entities can fulfill\ntheir financial obligations.\nCorporate Bonds. The corporate bond portfolio is comprised of both fixed and variable rate securities, including sub-\ndebt securities, issued by various financial institutions. At December 31, 2023, the corporate bond portfolio had a weighted-\naverage yield of 4.77%.\nMunicipal Bonds. The municipal bond portfolio is comprised of taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds. The pre-tax\nweighted-average yield on the municipal bond portfolio was 2.10% at December 31, 2023.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. As a member of the FHLB, we are required to own FHLB capital stock. The\nrequired amount of capital stock is based on a percentage of our previous year-end assets and our outstanding FHLB advances.\n16\nThe redemption of any excess stock we hold is at the discretion of the FHLB. During 2023, our FHLB stock holdings decreased\nby $1.0 million, primarily as a result of the $20.0 million decrease in our FHLB advances during the year. The carrying value of\nour FHLB stock totaled $6.5 million at December 31, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we received\ndividends on our FHLB stock of $485,000 and $318,000, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, there were no calls or sales of investment securities and one maturity of a\nsmall balance mortgage-backed security. During the year ended December 31, 2022, gross proceeds from the principal\nreductions and maturities of investments were $11.1 million, with net realized gains of $27,000.\nAvailable-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the amortized cost. On\na quarterly basis, management evaluates impaired debt securities to determine if an ACL is required. If it is determined that a\ncredit loss exists and an allowance is required, the credit loss on a debt security is measured as the difference between the\namortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, limited by the amount of the impairment. For\nimpaired debt securities that the Company does not intend to sell and it is not likely that it will be required to sell but does not\nexpect to recover the entire security’s amortized cost basis, only the portion of the impairment representing a credit loss would\nbe recognized in earnings. If the Company intends to sell a debt security, or it is likely that the Company will be required to sell\nthe debt security before recovering its cost basis, the entire impairment would be recognized through earnings. The Company\nconsiders many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment, economic circumstances, recent events specific to\nthe issuer or industry, and for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent rating updates. Projected cash flows are\ndiscounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the debt security being measured for a\npotential credit loss. The remaining impairment related to all other factors is recognized as a charge to other comprehensive\nincome (“OCI”).\nThe Company had 123 securities in an unrealized loss position at both December 31, 2023 and 2022, with 113 and 62\nof these securities in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nManagement does not believe that the unrealized losses at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were related to credit losses. The\ndeclines in fair market value of these securities were mainly attributed to changes in market interest rates, credit spreads, market\nvolatility and liquidity conditions. Currently, the Company does not intend to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the\nCompany will be required to sell the positions before their recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. As\nsuch, no ACL was recorded with respect to AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes.\nScheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are\ninfluenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB are used to supplement the\navailability of funds from other sources and also as a source of term funds to assist in the management of interest rate risk.\nOur deposit composition reflects a mixture of various deposit products. We rely on marketing activities, customer\nservice, and the availability of a broad range of products and services to attract and retain customer deposits.\nDeposits. We offer a competitive range of deposit products within our market area, including noninterest bearing\naccounts, interest-bearing demand accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit\naccount terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on account, and the\ninterest rate, among other factors. When determining the terms for deposit accounts, we consider the development of long-term\nprofitable customer relationships, current market interest rates, maturity structures, deposit mix, customer preferences, and the\nprofitability of acquiring customer deposits compared to alternative funding sources. To align our deposit mix with lower cost\nfunds, we consistently adjust our pricing to remain competitive with local market rates. As part of our strategy, we actively\nmanage our deposit mix, and to complement local deposits, we may generate funds as needed through the wholesale market,\nwhich may involve brokered deposits. The Company had $130.8 million and $124.9 million of brokered deposits at December\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company may continue to utilize brokered deposits to supplement our retail deposits and\ncontribute to our interest rate risk management efforts.\nThe following table sets forth our total deposit activity for the years indicated.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nTotal deposits, beginning balance $ 1,170,040 $ 1,157,474 $ 1,093,633\n(Decrease) increase in retail deposits 18,163 (112,320) 63,841\nIncrease (decrease) in brokered funds 5,904 124,886 —\nNet increase in deposits 24,067 12,566 63,841\nTotal deposits, ending balance $ 1,194,107 $ 1,170,040 $ 1,157,474\nAt December 31, 2023, deposits totaled $1.19 billion. We had $513.3 million of deposit accounts greater than the\nFDIC insurance amount of $250,000, representing 43.0% of our total deposits. Of this amount, $170.1 million were retail\ncertificates of deposit. At December 31, 2022, $568.7 million, or 48.6%, of deposit accounts were greater than $250,000. At\nDecember 31, 2023, we held $85.8 million in public funds, of which $48.8 million exceeded $250,000.

Customer deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. We use\nadvances from the FHLB and to a lesser extent federal funds (“Fed Funds”) purchased to supplement our supply of lendable\nfunds, to meet short-term deposit withdrawal requirements and to provide longer term funding to assist in the management of\nour interest rate risk by matching the duration of selected loan and investment maturities.\n21\nAs a member of the FHLB, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances\non the security of that stock and certain of our mortgage loans, provided that certain creditworthiness standards have been met.\nAdvances are individually made under various terms pursuant to several different credit programs, each with its own interest\nrate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial\ncondition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. We maintain a credit facility\nwith the FHLB that provides for immediately available advances, subject to acceptable collateral. At December 31, 2023, our\nremaining FHLB credit capacity was $561.3 million and outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $125.0 million. In\naddition, at December 31, 2023, we had supplemental funding sources of $55.8 million available at the FRB and $75.0 million\navailable between two correspondent financial institutions.\nOther than our utilization of interest rate swaps, we do not currently participate in other hedging programs, stand-alone\ncontracts for interest rate caps or floors or other activities involving the use of off-balance sheet derivative financial\ninstruments, however, these options are evaluated on occasion. As of December 31, 2023, we had eight interest rate swaps with\nan aggregate notional amount of $115.0 million and a fair value gain of $7.6 million as compared to seven interest rate swaps\nwith an aggregate notional amount of $95.0 million and a fair value gain of $10.5 million at December 31, 2022. The\n$115.0 million notional amount included two new agreements we entered into with qualified institutions on July 17, 2023. One\nagreement had a $15.0 million notional amount, a two-year maturity and a fixed rate of 4.57%. The second agreement also had\na $15.0 million notional amount, a three-year maturity and a fixed rate of 4.15%. On November 20, 2023, a $10.0 million\nnotional swap with a four-year maturity and a fixed rate of 1.59% matured and was not replaced. For additional information,\nsee Item 1A. Risk Factors -“Risks Related to Market and Interest Rate Changes - If interest rate swaps we enter into prove\nineffective, it could result in volatility in our operating results, including potential losses, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations and cash flows,” Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations - Asset and Liability Management,” and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontained in Item 8 of this report.\nSubsidiaries and Other Activities\nFirst Financial Northwest has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Bank and First Financial Diversified Corporation.\nThe Bank is a community-based commercial bank which primarily serves the greater Puget Sound region of King and to a\nlesser extent, Pierce, Snohomish and Kitsap Counties, Washington through our full-service banking office in Renton,\nWashington and fourteen additional branches in King, Pierce and Snohomish Counties, Washington. We are in the business of\nattracting deposits from the public and utilizing those deposits to originate loans. First Financial Diversified Corporation\npreviously held a small portfolio of loans. Subsequent to these loans paying off in 2019, the company has had minimal activity.\nCompetition\nThe Bank operates in the highly competitive Puget Sound region of Western Washington. We face competition in\noriginating loans and attracting deposits within our geographic market area. The competitive environment is impacted by\nchanges in the regulatory environment, technology and product delivery systems as well as consolidation in the industry\ncreating larger, more diversified competitors. We compete by consistently delivering high-quality personal service to our\ncustomers that results in a high level of customer satisfaction.\nThe Bank attracts deposits primarily through its branch office system. The competition is primarily from commercial\nbanks, savings institutions and credit unions in the same geographic area. Based on the most current FDIC market share data\ndated June 30, 2023, the top five banks in the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan statistical area (comprised of Bank of\nAmerica, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp and KeyBank) controlled 72% of the deposit market. In addition to the\nFDIC insured competitors, credit unions, insurance companies and brokerage firms also compete for consumer deposit\nrelationships. The Bank’s share of aggregate deposits in the market area is less than 1%.\nOur competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, mortgage brokers, thrift institutions, credit\nunions and finance companies. Several other financial institutions compete with us for banking business in our market area.\nThese institutions have substantially more resources than the Bank and, as a result, are able to offer a broader range of services,\nsuch as trust departments and enhanced retail services. Among the advantages of some of these institutions are their ability to\nmake larger loans, initiate extensive advertising campaigns, access lower cost funding sources, and allocate their investable\nassets in regions of highest yield and demand. The challenges posed by such large competitors may impact our ability to\noriginate loans, secure low cost deposits, and establish product pricing levels that support our net interest margin goals that may\nlimit our future growth and earnings potential.\n22\nHuman Capital\nThe Company continually strives to recruit the most talented, motivated employees in their respective fields. By\nproviding opportunities for personal and professional growth coupled with an environment that values teamwork and work-life\nbalance, we are able to attract and retain outstanding individuals. We pride ourselves on providing excellent benefits,\ncompetitive salaries and the opportunity for participation in the company's long-term success.\nWorkforce. At December 31, 2023, we had 142 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any\ncollective bargaining group. The Company is committed to providing equality of opportunity in all aspects of employment\nthrough a comprehensive affirmative action plan that is updated annually. As of December 31, 2023, our workforce was 58.5%\nfemale and 41.5% male, and women held 52.5% of the Bank’s management roles. The average tenure of mid-level officers and\nmanagers is 4.7 years and the average tenure of executive/senior level officers is 9.8 years. The ethnicity of our workforce was\n61.3% White, 26.8% Asian, 4.2% Hispanic or Latino, 2.8% Black, 2.1% Two or More Races, 0.7% Native Hawaiian or Other\nPacific Islander, and 2.1% undisclosed at December 31, 2023.\nThe following chart depicts the percentage of self-identified females and minorities in our workforce at December 31,\n2023, by job classification as defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”):\nDistribution by EEOC\nJob Classification Female Minority (1) Job Classification\nExecutive / Senior level officers 46.2 % 46.2 % 9.2 %\nMid-level officers and managers 54.2 31.3 33.8\nProfessionals 45.5 36.4 23.2\nSales workers 37.5 37.5 5.6\nTechnicians — 50.0 1.4\nAdministrative support 86.8 47.4 26.8\nTotal 58.5 % 38.7 % 100.0 %\n__________\n(1) Includes employees self-disclosed as Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino, or Two or\nMore Races.\nBenefits. The Company provides competitive comprehensive benefits to employees. The Company values the health\nand well-being of its employees and strives to provide programs to support this. Benefit programs available to eligible\nemployees may include 401(k) savings plan, profit-sharing plan, ESOP, health and life insurance, employee assistance program,\npaid holidays, paid time off, and other leave as applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company made changes to its 401(k)\nplan to qualify as a “Safe Harbor” plan. Under the revised plan, employee contributions up to 5% will be matched 100% by the\nCompany and said matching contributions will be immediately vested to the employee. Separately, in an effort to replace the\nESOP benefits that matured in 2022, the Company introduced a profit-sharing plan beginning in 2023, wherein a contribution\nwill be made to every employee’s retirement account in an amount ranging from 5% to 8% annually, based on the Company’s\nprofitability.\nBoard of Directors. The Company’s Board of Directors is comprised of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer and five non-employee directors. The non-employee directors are represented by 60% female and 20%\nminority.\nTraining and education. The Company recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the\nsuccess of the organization, and promotes training and continuing education as an ongoing function for employees. The Bank’s\ncompliance training program provides annual training courses to assure that all employees and officers know the rules\napplicable to their jobs.\nHow We Are Regulated\nThe following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to First Financial Northwest and\nthe Bank. On March 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest converted from a registered savings and loan holding company to a\nbank holding company. As a bank holding company, First Financial Northwest is subject to examination and supervision by,\n23\nand is required to file certain reports with the FRB. First Financial Northwest also is subject to the rules and regulations of the\nSEC under the federal securities laws. The Bank, which changed its charter from a Washington-chartered savings bank to a\nWashington-chartered commercial bank effective on February 11, 2016, is subject to regulation and oversight by the DFI, the\napplicable provisions of Washington law and by the regulations of the DFI adopted thereunder. The Bank also is subject to\nregulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nThe laws and regulations governing us may be amended from time to time by the relevant legislative bodies and\nregulators. Any such legislative action or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect us. We cannot predict whether\nany such changes may occur.\nRegulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank\nGeneral. As a state-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to applicable provisions of Washington state law\nand regulations of the DFI in addition to federal law and regulations of the FDIC applicable to state banks that are not members\nof the Federal Reserve System. State law and regulations govern the Bank’s ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make\nloans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking\nservices to its customers and to establish branch offices. Under state law, commercial banks in Washington also generally have\nall of the powers that federal commercial banks have under federal laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to periodic\nexamination by and reporting requirements of the DFI.\nInsurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to $250,000 per separately\ninsured deposit ownership right or category by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes\ndeposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured\ninstitutions.\nThe FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums quarterly on each FDIC-insured institution applied to its deposit base,\nwhich is its average consolidated total assets minus its Tier 1 capital. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its\nfederal deposit insurance assessment. Total base assessment rates currently range from 5 to 32 basis points subject to certain\nadjustments.\nExtraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the DIF reserve ratio to\ndecline below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent. In September 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a Restoration\nPlan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent within eight years, absent extraordinary circumstances, as required by\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Restoration Plan maintained the assessment rate schedules in place at the time and\nrequired the FDIC to update its analysis and projections for the deposit insurance fund balance and reserve ratio at least\nsemiannually. In the semiannual update for the Restoration Plan in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the reserve ratio was at\nrisk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline to restore the reserve\nratio. Based on this update, the FDIC Board approved an Amended Restoration Plan, and concurrently proposed an increase in\ninitial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, applicable to all insured depository\ninstitutions. In October 2022, the FDIC Board adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate\nschedules uniformly by two basis points, with an effective date of January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment\nperiod of 2023. The revised assessment rate schedules are intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF\nreaches the statutory minimum level of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028\nManagement cannot predict what FDIC assessment rates will be in the future. In a banking industry emergency, the\nFDIC may also impose a special assessment. The Bank paid $683,000 in FDIC assessments for the year ending December 31,\n2023.\nAs insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions.\nThe FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to\npose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against banks and savings\nassociations. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Bank's deposit\ninsurance.\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines\nestablishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit\nunderwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees and benefits. In general,\nthe guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures\nspecified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe\n24\ncompensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an\nexecutive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of\nthese guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. Management of\nthe Bank is not aware of any conditions relating to these safety and soundness standards which would require submission of a\nplan of compliance.\nCapital Requirements. Federally insured financial institutions, such as the Bank, and their holding companies, are\nrequired to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital.\nThe Bank is subject to capital regulations adopted by the FDIC, which establish minimum required ratios for a\ncommon equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to\nrisk-based assets ratio and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The capital standards require the maintenance of the\nfollowing minimum capital ratios: (i) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of\n8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to\nsubsidiary banks generally apply to bank holding companies. However, the Federal Reserve has provided a “Small Bank\nHolding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements, and bank holding companies with less than $3.0 billion\nof consolidated assets are not subject to the consolidated holding company capital requirements unless otherwise directed by the\nFederal Reserve.\nThe Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), enacted in May 2018,\nrequired the federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, to establish for institutions with assets of less than $10 billion a\n“community bank leverage ratio” or “CBLR” of between 8 to 10%. Institutions with capital meeting or exceeding the ratio and\notherwise complying with the specified requirements (including off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of total assets and\ntrading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) and electing the alternative framework are considered to comply with\nthe applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. The CBLR was established at 9% Tier 1\ncapital to total average assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank\nleverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is\nprovided with a two-quarter grace period to again achieve compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace\nperiod or maintain a leverage ratio of 8% or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable capital\nrequirements. Although the Bank qualified to make this election, as of December 31, 2023, management has not elected to use\nthe CBLR as the Bank’s margin above the current minimum levels to be well-capitalized is greater than our margin would be\nunder the CBLR.\nIn addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratios, the capital regulations require a capital conservation\nbuffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in\norder to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses.\nTo be considered “well capitalized,” a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%,\na total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not\nbe subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to\nmaintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2023, First Financial Northwest Bank met the requirements to be “well\ncapitalized” and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement.\n25\nThe table below sets forth the Bank’s capital position at December 31, 2023 and 2022, based on FDIC thresholds to be\nwell-capitalized.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in thousands)\nBank equity capital under GAAP $ 152,264 $ 150,370\nTier 1 leverage capital $ 158,629 10.18 % $ 156,147 10.31 %\nTier 1 leverage capital requirement 77,936 5.00 75,722 5.00\nExcess $ 80,693 5.18 % $ 80,425 5.31 %\nCommon equity tier 1 $ 158,629 14.90 % $ 156,147 14.37 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital requirement 69,220 6.50 70,641 6.50\nExcess $ 89,409 8.40 % $ 85,506 7.87 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital $ 158,629 14.90 % $ 156,147 14.37 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital requirement 85,194 8.00 86,942 8.00\nExcess $ 73,435 6.90 % $ 69,205 6.37 %\nTotal risk-based capital $ 171,971 16.15 % $ 169,755 15.62 %\nTotal risk-based capital requirement 106,493 10.00 108,678 10.00\nExcess $ 65,478 6.15 % $ 61,077 5.62 %\nThe FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a\ndetermination that an institution’s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances.\nFor a complete description of the Bank’s required and actual capital levels on December 31, 2023, see Note 14 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13\nthat became effective for us for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022. This standard, referred to as Current\nExpected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to\nrecognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current\nmethod of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, we\nrecorded a one-time adjustment of $395,000 to retained earnings, and a $500,000 increase to the allowance for credit losses in\nthe first quarter of 2023.\nPrompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework for FDIC-insured institutions based on\nfive capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically\nundercapitalized. An institution’s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures.\nThe well-capitalized category is described above. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on\nbrokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. To be considered adequately\ncapitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. Any institution which is neither well\ncapitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. The previously referenced final rule establishing an\nelective “community bank leverage ratio” regulatory capital framework provides that a qualifying institution whose capital\nexceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to use that framework will be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of\nprompt corrective action.\nUndercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and\nrestrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by the Bank to\n26\ncomply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its\nactivities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the\nmaintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking\nregulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital\nrequirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with\ncapital requirements.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations\nof the FDIC. For additional information, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of\nthis report.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, one of 11 regional FHLBs\nthat administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions. The FHLBs are subject to the oversight of the Federal\nHousing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) and each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned\nregion. The FHLBs are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System\nand make loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of\nthe FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the FHFA. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by\nsufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential\nhome financing. See “Business – Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds – Borrowings.”\nAs a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Des Moines based on the Bank's\nasset size and level of borrowings from the FHLB. At December 31, 2023, the Bank held $6.5 million in FHLB stock that was\nin compliance with the holding requirements. The FHLB pays dividends quarterly, and the Bank received $485,000 in\ndividends during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest\nsubsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions\nhave adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could\nalso have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank’s FHLB stock may result\nin a decrease in net income and possibly capital.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk\nmanagement practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial\nreal estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to\nconditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or\nas an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide\nbanks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate\nconcentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other federal bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources\non institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid\ngrowth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is\napproaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to\nreal estate concentration risk:\n• Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s total\nregulatory capital; or\n• Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank’s total regulatory\ncapital and the outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more\nduring the prior 36 months.\nThe guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such\nconcentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Bank’s aggregate recorded loan balances for construction, land development and land loans were 38.3% of regulatory\ncapital. In addition, at December 31, 2023, the Bank’s loans on commercial real estate, as defined by the FDIC, were 316.8% of\nregulatory capital.\nActivities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions. Federal law generally limits the\nactivities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An\n27\ninsured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary,\n(2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition,\nrehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not\nexceed 2% of the bank’s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures\ndirectors’, trustees’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured\ndepository institutions and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution owned by another FDIC-\ninsured institution if certain requirements are met.\nUnder the law of Washington State, Washington chartered savings banks may exercise any of the powers of\nWashington-chartered commercial banks, national banks and federally-chartered savings banks, subject to the approval of the\nDirector of the DFI in certain situations. In addition, Washington state-chartered commercial and savings banks may charge the\nmaximum interest rate allowable for loans and other extensions of credit by federally-chartered financial institutions to\nWashington residents.\nEnvironmental Issues Associated With Real Estate Lending. The Comprehensive Environmental Response,\nCompensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present\n“owners and operators” of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing\nthat the term “owner and operator” excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site.\nSince the enactment of the CERCLA, this “secured creditor exemption” has been the subject of judicial interpretations that have\nleft open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a\nloan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by\nproperties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for\ncleanup costs that often are substantial and can exceed the value of the collateral property.\nFederal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified\nlevels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking accounts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal\nReserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020, to support lending to households and\nbusinesses. At December 31, 2023, the Bank was in compliance with the reserve requirements in place at that time.\nAffiliate Transactions. First Financial Northwest and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. First Financial\nNorthwest (and any non-bank subsidiary of First Financial Northwest) is an affiliate of the Bank. Federal laws strictly limit the\nability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates. Transactions deemed to be a “covered transaction” under\nSection 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a bank and an affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank’s capital plus\nsurplus and, with respect to all affiliates, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank’s capital plus surplus. Further, covered transactions\nthat are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal\nlaw also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act\nbetween a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with nonaffiliates.\nIn addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to executive officers,\ndirectors and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, executive officer or greater than 10% shareholder\nof a bank and certain affiliated interests, generally may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and\naffiliated interests, 15% of the institution’s unimpaired capital plus surplus. Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors,\nexecutive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to\nother persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (1) is widely available to employees\nof the institution and (2) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal shareholder, or certain affiliated\ninterests, over other employees of the bank. Section 22(h) also requires prior Board approval for certain loans. In addition, the\naggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital plus surplus.\nFurthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. At December 31, 2023, the Bank was in\ncompliance with these restrictions.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977\n(“CRA”), which require the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank’s performance under the CRA in\nmeeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The\nregulatory agency’s assessment of the bank’s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank’s CRA performance must\nbe considered in connection with a bank’s application, to among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept\ndeposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally\nregulated financial institution. An unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denial of certain applications. The Bank received\nan “outstanding” rating during its most recent CRA examination.\n28\nDividends. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to First Financial Northwest depends upon the Bank’s\nearnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. According to Washington law,\nthe Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the\namount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the DFI. In\naddition, dividends may not be declared or paid if the Bank is in default in payment of any assessments due to the FDIC.\nDividends on the Bank’s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of\nthe Bank, without the approval of the Director of the DFI. Dividends payable by the Bank can be limited or prohibited if the\nBank does not meet the capital conservation buffer requirement.\nThe amount of dividends actually paid during any one period is affected by the Bank’s policy of maintaining a strong\ncapital position. Federal law further restricts dividends payable by an institution that does not meet the capital conservation\nbuffer requirement and provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution\nto be “undercapitalized,” as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies\nalso have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe\nand unsound practice.\nPrivacy Standards and Cybersecurity. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999\nmodernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial\nbanks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. Federal banking agencies, including the\nFDIC, have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing\nsafeguards under the supervision of the Board of Directors. These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials,\nincreasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the\nprovision of financial services. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers\nof its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices. In addition, other\nfederal and state cybersecurity and data privacy laws and regulations may expose the Bank to risk and result in certain risk\nmanagement costs. In addition, on November 18, 2021, the federal banking agencies announced the adoption of a final rule\nproviding for new notification requirements for banking organizations and their service providers for significant cybersecurity\nincidents. Specifically, the new rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator as soon as possible,\nand no later than 36 hours after, the banking organization determines that a “computer-security incident” rising to the level of a\n“notification incident” has occurred. Notification is required for incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect the viability of a banking organization’s operations, its ability to deliver banking products and services, or\nthe stability of the financial sector. Service providers are required under the rule to notify affected banking organization\ncustomers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computer-security incident that has\nmaterially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the banking organization’s customers for four or more hours.\nNon-compliance with federal or similar state privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could lead to substantial regulatory\nimposed fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action and/or reputational harm.\nIn July 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring registrants to disclose material cybersecurity incidents they experience\nand to disclose on an annual basis material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and\ngovernance. The new rules require registrants to disclose on Form 8-K any cybersecurity incident they determine to be material\nand to describe the material aspects of the incident’s nature, scope, and timing, as well as its material impact or reasonably\nlikely material impact on the registrant. For information regarding the Company’s cybersecurity risk management, strategy and\ngovernance, see “Item 1C. Cybersecurity” contained in Part I of this Form 10-K.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing\nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA Patriot Act) was signed into law on\nOctober 26, 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to develop programs to\nprevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected,\nfinancial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the\nidentity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts, and, effective in 2018, the beneficial owners of accounts. Bank\nregulators are directed to consider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Bank\nHolding Company Act and Bank Merger Act applications.\nOther Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (“CFPB”) and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with\nrespect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations\n29\nissued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, The Bank is generally subject to\nsupervision and enforcement by the FDIC with respect to its compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and\nCFPB regulations.\nThe Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost\nevery aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-\nin-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,\nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership\nand Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check\nClearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the\nsale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices and various regulations that\nimplement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the\nmanner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and\nproviding other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including\nbut not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and the loss of\ncertain contractual rights.\nRegulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest\nGeneral. First Financial Northwest, as sole shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company registered with the\nFederal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank\nHolding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the regulations of the FRB. Accordingly, First Financial Northwest\nis required to file semi-annual reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may\nrequire. The Federal Reserve may examine First Financial Northwest, and any of its subsidiaries, and charge First Financial\nNorthwest for the cost of the examination. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding\ncompanies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal\norders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement\nactions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. First Financial Northwest is also\nrequired to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nThe Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, First Financial Northwest is supervised by the Federal\nReserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and\nmanagerial strength to its subsidiary bank and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the\nDodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to\nits subsidiary bank by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial distress\nto the bank. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank will\ngenerally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal\nReserve’s regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of\nstrength provisions required by the Dodd-Frank Act. First Financial Northwest and any subsidiaries that it may control are\nconsidered “affiliates” within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between the Bank and affiliates are\nsubject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries are prohibited from tying\nthe provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by First Financial Northwest or by its\naffiliates.\nAcquisitions. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or\ncontrol of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in\nactivities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Under the\nBHCA, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company, the activities of\nwhich the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks\nas to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include: operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance\ncompany, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain\ninvestment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance;\nleasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers’ checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real\nestate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations,\nproviding securities brokerage services for customers. The Federal Reserve must approve the acquisition (or acquisition of\ncontrol) of a bank or other FDIC-insured depository institution by a bank holding company, and the appropriate federal banking\nregulator must approve a bank’s acquisition (or acquisition of control) of another bank or other FDIC-insured institution.\n30\nAcquisition of Control of a Bank Holding Company. Under federal law, a notice or application must be submitted\nto the appropriate federal banking regulator if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire\n“control” of a bank holding company. An acquisition of control can occur upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting\nstock of a bank holding company or as otherwise defined by federal regulations. In considering such a notice or application, the\nFederal Reserve takes into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the\nanti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control becomes subject to regulation as a bank holding\ncompany. Depending on circumstances, a notice or application may be required to be filed with appropriate state banking\nregulators and may be subject to their approval or non-objection.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements. As discussed above, pursuant to the “Small Bank Holding Company” exception,\neffective August 30, 2018, bank holding companies with less than $3 billion in consolidated assets were generally no longer\nsubject to the Federal Reserve’s capital regulations, which are generally the same as the capital regulations applicable to First\nFinancial Northwest Bank. At the time of this change, First Financial Northwest was considered “well capitalized” (as defined\nfor a bank holding company), with a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%\nor more, and was not subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which the Federal Reserve requires it to\nmaintain a specific capital level.\nRestrictions on Dividends. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by\nbank holding companies which expresses its view that a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and\ngenerally should not pay cash dividends unless the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash\ndividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality, and\noverall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company\nexperiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under Washington corporate law, First Financial\nNorthwest generally may not pay dividends if after that payment it would not be able to pay its liabilities as they become due in\nthe usual course of business, or its total assets would be less than its total liabilities. The capital conservation buffer requirement\ndiscussed above can also limit dividends. For additional information, see Item 1.A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Regulatory\nand Compliance Matters-Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could\nresult in fines or sanctions” in this report.\nStock Repurchases. A bank holding company, except for certain “well-capitalized” and highly rated bank holding\ncompanies, is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity\nsecurities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such\npurchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The\nFederal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or\nunsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written\nagreement with, the Federal Reserve. During the year ended December 31, 2023, First Financial Northwest did not repurchase\nany of its outstanding common stock.\nFederal Securities Laws. First Financial Northwest’s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b)\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). We are subject to information, proxy solicitation,\ninsider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.\nTaxation\nFederal Taxation\nGeneral. The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with\nsome exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent\nfederal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company. The tax years still\nopen for review by the Internal Revenue Service are 2020 through 2023.\nFirst Financial Northwest files a consolidated federal income tax return with the Bank. Accordingly, any cash\ndistributions made by First Financial Northwest to its shareholders are considered to be taxable dividends and not as a non-\ntaxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes.\nMethod of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on\nthe accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on December 31 for filing its federal income tax return.\n31\nNet Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carryforward net operating losses indefinitely. The\nCompany had no net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2023.\nCorporate Dividends-Received Deduction. First Financial Northwest may eliminate from its income dividends\nreceived from the Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest that files a consolidated return with the\nBank. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100%, or 80%, in the case of dividends received from corporations with\nwhich a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payer of the\ndividend. Corporations that own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 70% of\ndividends received or accrued on their behalf.\nFor additional information regarding our federal income taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements contained in Item 8 of this report.\nState Taxation\nThe Company is subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington state law at the rate of 1.75% of\ngross receipts for the Bank, as gross receipts are greater than $1.0 million, and 1.50% for its other subsidiaries with gross\nreceipts less than $1.0 million. In addition, various municipalities also assess business and occupation taxes at differing rates.\nInterest received on loans secured by first lien mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties, rental income from\nproperties, and certain investment securities are exempt from this tax. An audit by the Washington State Department of\nRevenue was completed for the years 2010 through 2013, resulting in no material tax revisions.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe business experience for at least the past five years for the executive officers of the Company is set forth below.\nJoseph W.

Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision,\nyou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in\nthis report and our other documents filed with and furnished to the SEC. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described\nbelow, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition, capital levels, cash flows, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nThe risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those\ndiscussed in these forward-looking statements. The market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of\nthese identified or other risks and you could lose some or all of your investment. This report is qualified in its entirety by these\nrisk factors.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur business may be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and in the economies in our market\nareas.\nOur loans are primarily to businesses and individuals in the state of Washington with 87.2% of loans to borrowers or\nsecured by properties located in Washington and 12.8% of loans to borrowers or secured by properties in other states. Through\nour efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio, at December 31, 2023, our portfolio included $152.8 million, or\n12.8% of loans to borrowers or secured by properties located in 46 other states and Washington, D.C., including $35.1 million,\nor 2.9% of loans, secured by properties or to borrowers in California. A decline in the national economy or the economies of the\nfour counties which we consider to be our primary market area could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and prospects. Weakness in the global economy and global supply chain issues have adversely\naffected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent upon international trade. Changes in agreements or\nrelationships between the United States and other countries may also affect these businesses.\nA deterioration in economic conditions in the market areas we serve as a result of inflation, a recession, or other\nfactors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations including, but not\nlimited to:\n• Reduced demand for our products and services, potentially leading to a decline in our overall loans or assets.\n33\n• Elevated instances of loan delinquencies, problematic assets, and foreclosures.\n• An increase in our allowance for credit looses on loans.\n• Depreciation in collateral values linked to our loans, thereby diminishing borrowing capacities and asset values tied to\nexisting loans.\n• Reduced net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors, possibly impairing their ability to meet commitments to us.\n• Reducing in our low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits.\nA decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and\ncapital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are geographically diverse. Many of the loans in our\nportfolio are secured by real estate. Deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for a mortgage loan is located could\nnegatively affect the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Real estate values are\naffected by various other factors, including changes in general or regional economic conditions, governmental rules or policies\nand natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornadoes. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during\na period of reduced real estate values, our financial condition and profitability could be adversely affected.\nAdverse changes in the regional and general economy could reduce our growth rate, impair our ability to collect loans\nand generally have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nExternal economic factors, such as changes in monetary policy and inflation, may have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the\nFederal Reserve Board. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, could lead to inflation,\ndeflation, or other economic phenomena that could adversely affect our financial performance. Inflation has risen sharply since\nthe end of 2021 and throughout 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures, while easing recently,\nremained elevated throughout the first half of 2023. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of\nhigh inflation as they are not able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses.\nConsequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate quickly, which would adversely impact\nour results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other\ncosts to the Company to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Virtually all of\nour assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates tend to have a more significant impact on our\nperformance than general levels of inflation or deflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or by the\nsame magnitude as the prices of goods and services.\nRisks Related to Our Lending\nOur construction/land loans are based upon estimates of costs and the value of the completed project.\nWe make construction/land loans to contractors and builders primarily to finance the construction of single and\nmultifamily homes, subdivisions, as well as commercial properties. We originate these loans regardless of whether the property\nused as collateral is under a sales contract. At December 31, 2023, construction/land loans totaled $60.9 million, or 5.1% of our\ntotal loan portfolio. At December 31, 2023, $47.1 million were one-to-four family construction loans and $4.0 million were\nmultifamily construction loans. We had no commercial construction loans at December 31, 2023. Land loans, which are loans\nmade with land as security, totaled $9.8 million, or 0.8% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2023. Land loans include\nthe purchase or refinance of unimproved land held for future residential development, improved residential lots held for\nspeculative investment purposes, lines of credit secured by land, and land development loans.\nConstruction lending involves inherent risks due to estimating costs in relation to project values. Uncertainties in\nconstruction costs, market value, and regulatory impacts make accurately evaluating total project funds and loan-to-value ratios\nchallenging. Factors like shifts in housing demand and unexpected building costs can significantly deviate actual results from\nestimates. Additionally, this type of lending often involves higher principal amounts and might be concentrated among a few\nbuilders. A downturn in housing or real estate markets could escalate delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, and compromise\ncollateral value.\nSome builders have multiple outstanding loans with us, meaning problems with one loan pose a substantial risk to us.\nMoreover, certain construction loans do not require borrower payments during the term, accumulating interest into the\nprincipal. Thus, repayment depends heavily on project success and the borrower's ability to sell, lease, or secure permanent\n34\nfinancing, rather than their ability to repay principal and interest directly. Misjudging a project's value could leave us with\ninadequate security and potential losses upon completion. Actively monitoring construction loans, involving cost comparisons\nand on-site inspections, adds complexity and cost. Market interest rate hikes also might significantly impact construction loans,\naffecting end-purchaser borrowing costs, potentially reducing demand or the homeowner's ability to finance the completed\nhome. Further, properties under construction are hard to sell and often need completion for successful sales, complicating\nproblem loan resolution. This might require additional funds or engaging another builder, incurring additional costs and market\nrisks. Moreover, speculative construction loans pose additional risks, especially regarding finding end-purchasers for finished\nprojects. At December 31, 2023, $47.1 million of our construction/land loans were for speculative construction loans.\nWe also offer land loans for land acquisition and development. However, loans for land development or future\nconstruction carry additional risks due to longer development periods, vulnerability to real estate value declines, economic\nfluctuations delaying projects, political changes affecting land use, and the collateral's illiquid nature. During this extended\nfinancing-to-completion period, the collateral often generates no cash flow.\nAll of our construction loans have a take-out commitment for a permanent loan with us. At December 31, 2023, all of\nour construction/land loans were classified as performing.\nOur level of commercial and multifamily real estate loans may expose us to increased lending risks.\nOur current business strategy includes an emphasis on commercial real estate lending. This type of lending activity,\nwhile potentially more profitable than one-to-four family residential lending, is generally more sensitive to regional and local\neconomic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict. Collateral evaluation and financial statement analysis in these\ntypes of loans requires a more detailed analysis at the time of loan underwriting and on an ongoing basis. At December 31,\n2023, we had $377.9 million of commercial real estate loans, representing 31.6% of our total loan portfolio and $138.1 million\nof multifamily loans, representing 11.6% of our total loan portfolio.\nCommercial and multifamily loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans, and repayment\nis dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to\ncover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market\nconditions. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower’s project is reduced as a result of leases not being obtained or\nrenewed, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Commercial real estate loans also expose a lender to greater\ncredit risk than loans secured by residential real estate, because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as\neasily as residential real estate. In addition, many of our commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large\nballoon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying\nproperty in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment.\nA secondary market for most types of commercial and multifamily real estate loans is not readily available, so we have\nless opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all our interest in these loans. As a result of these characteristics, if we\nforeclose on a commercial or multifamily real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for\none-to-four family residential loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, charge-offs on\ncommercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan\nportfolios.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have promulgated joint\nguidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending.\nUnder this guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a\nrisk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if,\namong other factors (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total\ncapital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential properties, loans for construction, land\ndevelopment and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to\ncommercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. Based on the FDIC criteria, the Bank had a\nconcentration in commercial real estate lending as total loans for multifamily, non-farm/non-residential, construction, land\ndevelopment and other land represented 316.8% of total capital at December 31, 2023. The particular focus of the guidance is\non exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that\nare likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a\nsecondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk\n35\nmanagement practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance\nstates that management should employ heightened risk management practices including Board and management oversight and\nstrategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress\ntesting. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate lending\nconsistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with\ntheir interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us.\nExpanding our commercial business portfolio may increase the Company’s exposure to risk.\nThe Company’s growth strategy includes increasing originations of business loans backed by non-real estate assets.\nOur business loans are primarily made based on borrowers’ cash flow, with collateral as a secondary factor. However, the\nunpredictability of borrowers' cash flow and the fluctuating value of collateral, often in the form of accounts receivable,\ninventory, or equipment, present significant risks. Loans secured by accounts receivable are contingent on the borrower's ability\nto collect from their customers, while other collateral may depreciate, be challenging to assess, lack liquidity, and vary in value\nbased on the success of the business. Additionally, economic fluctuations can significantly impact borrowers' repayment\nabilities, more so than loans secured by real estate.\nOur non-owner occupied real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2023, $228.8 million, representing 44.6% of our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio and\n19.2% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by non-owner occupied residential properties. Loans secured by\nnon-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner\noccupied properties. The repayment of such loans relies predominantly on the tenant's consistent rental payments to the\nborrower, who in turn is our client. In instances where the property owner fails to secure a tenant, repayment becomes\ncontingent on the owner's capacity to service the loan without rental income. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner\noccupied properties is often below that of owner occupied properties due to lenient property maintenance standards that\nnegatively impact the value of the collateral properties, can negatively impact the collateral property values, heightening\npotential losses for lenders. Furthermore, some of our non-owner occupied residential loan borrowers have more than one loan\noutstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to\na significantly greater risk of loss. At December 31, 2023, we had 128 non-owner occupied residential loan relationships with\nan outstanding balance over $500,000 and an aggregate balance of $183.9 million.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt December 31, 2023, $513.2 million, or 43.1% of our total loan portfolio, was secured by first liens on one-to-four\nfamily residential properties. In addition, at December 31, 2023, our home equity lines of credit totaled $12.5 million. A\nsignificant portion of our one-to-four family residential real estate loan portfolio consists of jumbo loans that do not conform to\nsecondary market mortgage requirements, and therefore are not immediately salable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac because\nsuch loans exceed the maximum balance allowable for sale (generally $647,000 to $891,000 for single-family homes in our\nprimary market areas in 2023). Jumbo one-to-four family residential loans may expose us to increased risk because of their\nlarger balances, and because they cannot be immediately sold to government sponsored enterprises.\nIn addition, one-to-four family residential loans are generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that\nsignificantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A\ndecline in residential real estate values resulting from a downturn in the housing market may reduce the value of the real estate\ncollateral securing these types of loans and increase our risk of loss if borrowers default on their loans. Recessionary conditions\nor declines in the volume of real estate sales and/or the sales prices coupled with elevated unemployment rates may result in\nhigher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, and a decline in demand for our products and services. These\npotential negative events may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital and liquidity and damage our financial\ncondition and business operations.\nTo meet our growth objectives we may originate or purchase loans outside of our market area which could affect the\nlevel of our net interest margin and nonperforming loans.\nTo achieve our desired loan portfolio growth, we have actively pursued and may continue seeking opportunities to\noriginate or purchase loans outside of our market area, whether individually, through participations, or in bulk or “pools.” Prior\nto purchase, we perform certain due diligence procedures and may re-underwrite these loans to our underwriting standards.\nAlthough we anticipate acquiring loans with customary limited indemnities, this approach exposes us to heightened risks,\n36\nparticularly when acquiring loans in unfamiliar geographic areas or of a type where our management lacks substantial prior\nexperience. Monitoring such loans also may pose greater challenges for us. Further, when determining the purchase price for\nthese loans, management will make certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, how borrowers will prepay their loans,\nthe real estate market, and our ability to successfully manage loan collections and, if necessary, dispose of acquired real estate\nthrough foreclosure. To the extent that our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or undergo unexpected changes, such as an\nunanticipated decline in the real estate market, the purchase price paid could exceed the actual value, resulting in a lower yield\nor a loss of some or all of the loan principal. For instance, purchasing loan \"pools\" at a premium and experiencing earlier-than-\nexpected loan prepayments would yield lower interest income than initially projected. Our success in increasing our loan\nportfolio through loan purchases depends on our ability to price the loans properly and relies on the economic conditions in the\ngeographic areas where the underlying properties or collateral for the acquired loans are located. Inaccurate estimates or\ndeclines in economic conditions or real estate values in the markets where we purchase loans could significantly adversely\naffect the level of our nonperforming loans and our results of operations. At December 31, 2023, our loan portfolio included\n$81.8 million, constituting 6.9% of total loans, in counties located within Washington State but outside of our primary market\narea. In addition, our portfolio included $152.8 million, or 12.8% of total loans, of loans located outside of Washington State.\nIf the lead institutions on our loan participation agreements do not keep us informed about the changes in credit quality\non the underlying loans in a timely manner, we could be subject to misstatement in our ACL, or possibly losses on these\nloans.\nUnder our participation agreements, the lead institution bears the responsibility of acquiring pertinent credit\ninformation concerning the associated loans. Failure to promptly relay any credit deterioration in these loans to us could lead to\ninaccuracies in grading these loans, consequently resulting in an understatement of our ACL. In scenarios where credit\ndeterioration occurs without timely information reaching us, our ACL might not accurately reflect the loan risks. Substantial\ncredit downgrades, if not adequately accounted for in our ACL, could potentially lead to losses on these loans. At December 31,\n2023, we had $28.8 million in loan participations in which we were not the lead lender.\nWe engage in aircraft and classic and collectible car financing transactions, in which high-value collateral is susceptible\nto potential catastrophic loss. Consequently, if any of these transactions becomes nonperforming, we could suffer a loss\non some or all of our value in the assets.\nAs our primary focus for aircraft loans is on the asset value of the collateral, the collectability of these loans ultimately\nmay be dependent on the value of the underlying collateral. Aircraft values have historically experienced significant\nfluctuations due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the availability of used aircraft, shifts in passenger and air\ncargo demand, increases in fuel costs, government regulation and the comparative value of newly manufactured similar aircraft.\nSimilarly, classic and collectible car values are affected by availability and demand; however, due to the unique nature,\nestimated values often differ from listed values. Therefore, loan approval for these assets is predominantly based on the\nborrower’s ability to repay. An aircraft, classic or collectible car as collateral also presents unique risks because of its high-\nvalue and susceptibility to rapid relocation, as well as the potential for significant loss. Although the loan documentation for\nthese transactions will include insurance covenants and other provisions to protect us against risk of loss, there can be no\nassurance that the insurance proceeds would be sufficient to ensure our full recovery of the loan. Moreover, a limited number of\nnonperforming loans could have a significant negative impact on the overall value of our loan portfolio. Liquidating a\nsignificant number of aircraft or classic or collectible cars during periods of reduced values could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and profitability. At December 31, 2023, our loan portfolio included $58.6 million in classic and collectible car loans\nand $1.9 million in aircraft loans.\nOur ACL for loans may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio. Future additions to our ACL for\nloans, as well as charge-offs in excess of reserves, will reduce our earnings.\nOur business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. As with most financial institutions, we maintain an\nACL for loans to reserve for estimated potential losses on loans from defaults, and represents management's best estimate of\nexpected credit losses over the life of the loan portfolio. Determining the appropriate level of the ACL for loans involves\nestimating future losses at the time a loan is originated or acquired, incorporating a broader range of information and future\neconomic scenarios. The determination of the appropriate level of the ACL for loans inherently involves a high degree of\nsubjectivity and requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including\nthe creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of\nmany of our loans. In determining the amount of the ACL for loans, we review loans and our historical loss and delinquency\nexperience and evaluate economic conditions. Management also recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, new\nloan products, and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform\n37\nin a historical or projected manner and will increase the risk that our ACL for loans may be insufficient to absorb credit losses\nwithout significant additional provisions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our ACL for loans may not be sufficient to cover\nactual losses, resulting in additional provisions for credit losses on loans to replenish the ACL for loans. Deterioration in\neconomic conditions, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans or relationships, and\nother factors, both within and outside of our control, may increase our loan charge-offs and/or otherwise require an increase in\nour provision for credit losses on loans. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ACL for loans. Based on\ntheir assessment, they and may require increased provisions or loan charge-offs. Any increase in the provision for credit losses\non loans affects net income and could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, and capital.\nRisks Related to Market and Interest Rate Changes\nOur results of operations, liquidity and cash flows are subject to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to\nmany factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and\nregulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Since March 2022, in response to inflation, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (“FOMC”) of the Federal Reserve has increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 525 basis, including\n100 basis points during 2023, to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% as of December 31, 2023. If the FOMC further increases the\ntargeted federal funds rates, overall interest rates will likely rise, which will negatively impact our net interest income and may\nnegatively impact both the housing market by reducing refinancing activity and new home purchases and the U.S. economy.\nWe principally manage interest rate risk by managing the volume and mix of our earning assets and funding liabilities.\nIn a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to manage this risk effectively. If we are unable to manage interest\nrate risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.\nChanges in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing the ability of\nborrowers to repay their current loan obligations or by reducing our margins and profitability. Our net interest margin is the\ndifference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding.\nChanges in interest rates—up or down—could adversely affect our net interest margin and, as a result, our net interest income.\nAlthough the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in\ninterest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend\nto be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when\ninterest rates increase, the yield we earn on our assets may not rise as fast as our funding costs, causing our net interest margin\nto contract. Changes in the slope of the “yield curve”—or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates—could\nalso reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-\nterm rates, however, at December 31, 2023, the yield curve was inverted with short-term rates above long-term rates. Because\nour liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we could experience\npressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. Also, interest\nrate decreases can lead to increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities as borrowers refinance their loans to\nreduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk as we may have to redeploy such\nrepayment proceeds into lower yielding investments, which would likely hurt our income.\nA sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings. As is the case with many banks our\nemphasis on increasing core deposits has resulted in an increasing percentage of our deposits being comprised of deposits\nbearing no or a relatively low rate of interest and having a shorter duration than our assets. We would incur a higher cost of\nfunds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings\nincrease at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore\nearnings, could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, a portion of our adjustable-rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan’s contractual interest\nrate may not adjust. At December 31, 2023, 63.5% of our net loans were comprised of adjustable-rate loans. At that date,\n$410.8 million, or 54.3%, of these loans with an average interest rate of 4.75% were at their floor interest rate. The inability of\nour loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates, although this result is\nsubject to the risks that borrowers may refinance these loans during periods of declining interest rates. Also, when loans are at\ntheir respective floor, which is above the fully-indexed rate, there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as\nrapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\n38\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of securities portfolio. Generally, the fair value of fixed-rate securities\nfluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a\nseparate component of equity, net of tax. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in\ninterest rates could have an adverse effect on stockholders’ equity.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the\npotential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in\nmarket interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Also,\nour interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate\nchanges on our balance sheet or projected operating results. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact\nus, see Part II, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" for additional information about our\ninterest rate risk management.\nIf interest rate swaps we entered into prove ineffective, it could result in volatility in our operating results, including\npotential losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of the borrowings we use to maintain liquidity and\nfund our expansion and operations. To limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash\nflows and to lower overall borrowing costs while taking into account variable interest rate risk, we may borrow at fixed rates or\nvariable rates depending upon prevailing market conditions. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as\ninterest rate swaps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument.\nOur interest rate contracts expose us several risks, including:\n• Potential loss due to variations in the spread between the interest rate contract and the hedged item.\n• Risks related to the counterparty’s inability to fulfill obligations.\n• Exposure to fluctuations and uncertainties in underlying asset prices due to interest rates and market volatility.\n• Liquidity risk associated with the ease of buying or selling these instruments.\nIf we suffer losses on our interest rate contracts, our business, financial condition and prospects may be negatively\naffected, and our net income will decline.\nWe record the swaps at fair value and designate them as an effective cash flow hedge under Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Each quarter, we measure hedge effectiveness using the “hypothetical\nderivative method” and record in earnings any gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. The hedge provided by our\nswaps could prove to be ineffective for a number of reasons, including early retirement of the debt, as is allowed under the debt,\nor in the event the counterparty to the interest rate swaps were determined to not be creditworthy. Any determination that the\nhedge created by the swaps was ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and\nresult in volatility in our operating results. In addition, any changes in relevant accounting standards relating to the swaps,\nespecially ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, could materially increase earnings volatility.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $115.0 million.\nAt December 31, 2023, the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a $7.6 million gain. For additional information, see\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset and Liability Management”.\nWe may incur losses on our securities portfolio.\nThe fair value of our investment securities is susceptible to significant shifts due to factors beyond our control,\npotentially leading to adverse changes in their valuation. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in\nrespect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or adverse events related to the underlying securities, capital market instability,\nand, as previously mentioned, fluctuations in market interest rates. Any of these factors, among others, could cause the fair\nvalue of these securities to be lower than the amortized cost basis resulting in a credit loss, which could have a material effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe\nand sound operation, potentially requiring us to sell securities at a loss if our liquidity position falls below desirable level and all\nalternative sources of liquidity are exhausted. In an environment where other market participants are also liquidating securities,\nour loss could be materially higher than expected, significantly adversely impacting liquidity and capital levels.\n39\nEvents impacting the financial services industry could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the financial services industry was negatively affected by the bank failures involving\nSilicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Subsequently, First Republic Bank was acquired by JP Morgan Chase after the FDIC\nwas appointed receiver. The adverse events involving Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank caused significant volatility in\nthe trading prices of stock of publicly traded banks and holding companies and have decreased confidence in banks among\ndepositors and investors. Such ramifications could continue or worsen in light of the recent failure and acquisition of First\nRepublic Bank. Banking regulators’ actions in response to these events have included ensuring that depositors of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank would have access to their deposits, including uninsured deposit accounts, establishing the Bank\nTerm Funding Program as an additional source of liquidity for banks generally, and most recently facilitating the acquisition of\nFirst Republic Bank by JP Morgan Chase. Continued concerns relating to these adverse events could result in a reduction in\ndemand for our products and services, including withdrawals of uninsured deposits, and could impact profitability and\nstockholders’ equity. The premiums of the FDIC’s deposit insurance program are expected to increase, and banking regulators\nhave signaled further review of regulatory requirements and the potential for changes to laws or regulations governing banks\nand bank holding companies. Changes resulting from these events could include increased regulatory oversight, higher capital\nrequirements or changes in the way regulatory capital is calculated, and the impositions of additional restrictions through\nregulatory changes or supervisory or enforcement activities, each of which could have a material impact on our business.\nRisks contained in our corporate bond portfolio from securities issued by other financial institutions could adversely\nimpact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our corporate bond portfolio is comprised of subordinated debentures and bonds issued by other\nfinancial institutions. If the market perception of any of these financial institutions or the financial institutions industry in\ngeneral deteriorates, we will see additional declines in the value of the securities issued by the financial institutions and it will\nadversely impact our financial condition. Further, if any of these financial institutions fail, we will suffer losses that will\nadversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business Strategy\nOur branching strategy may cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues.\nOur current business strategy includes branch expansion in strategic areas to enhance our market presence. These new\nbranches tend to be much smaller than traditional bank branch offices, utilizing the improved technology available with our\ncore data processor. This allows us to maintain management’s focus on efficiency, while working to expand our presence into\nnew markets. The success of our expansion strategy into new markets, however, is contingent upon numerous factors, such as\nour ability to select suitable locations, assess each market’s competitive environment, secure managerial resources, hire and\nretain qualified personnel and implement effective marketing strategies. The opening of new offices may not increase the\nvolume of our loans and deposits as quickly as or to the degree that we hope, and opening new offices will increase our\noperating expenses. On average, de novo branches do not become profitable until three to four years after opening. We\ncurrently expect to lease rather than own any additional branch properties. Further, the projected timeline and the estimated\ndollar amounts involved in opening de novo branches could differ significantly from actual results. The success of our acquired\nbranches is dependent on retention of existing customers’ deposits as well as expanding our market presence in these locations.\nWe may not successfully manage the costs and implementation risks associated with our branching strategy. Accordingly, any\nnew branch may negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches certain economies of scale.\nFinally, there is a risk that our new branches will not be successful even after they have been established or acquired.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Compliance Matters\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or\nsanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act and Bank Secrecy Acts and related regulations require financial institutions to develop\nprograms to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. Failure to comply with\nthese regulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large\nfines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist\nin compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in\npreventing violations of these laws and regulations. If our policies and procedures are deemed deficient, we would be subject to\n40\nliability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the denial of\nregulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including acquisitions. Failure to maintain and\nimplement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational\nconsequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and growth prospects.\nIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer\nunexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is\ncritical to optimizing stockholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor,\nreport, analyze and control the types of risk to which we are subject. These risks include liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk,\ninterest rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and reputational risk, among others. We also maintain a\ncompliance program designed to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable laws, policies and\nprocedures. While we assess and improve these programs on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that our risk\nmanagement or compliance programs, along with other related controls, will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in our\nbusiness. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as\nthere may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management\nframework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business financial condition and results of operations\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to an extensive body of accounting rules and best practices. Periodic changes to such rules may change\nthe treatment and recognition of critical financial line items and affect our profitability.\nOur business operations are significantly influenced by the extensive body of accounting regulations in the United\nStates. Regulatory bodies periodically issue new guidance, altering accounting rules and reporting requirements, which can\nsubstantially affect the preparation and reporting of our financial statements. These changes might necessitate retrospective\napplication, potentially leading to restatements of prior period financial statements.\nOne such significant change in 2023 was the implementation of the CECL model, which we adopted on January 1,\n2023. Under the CECL model, financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, are\npresented at the net amount expected to be collected. This forward-looking approach in estimating expected credit losses\ncontrasts starkly with the prior, \"incurred loss\" model, which delays recognition until a loss is probable. CECL mandates\nconsidering historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts affecting collectability, leading to periodic\nadjustments of financial asset values. However, this forward-looking methodology, reliant on macroeconomic variables,\nintroduces the potential for increased earnings volatility due to unexpected changes in these indicators between periods. An\nadditional consequence of CECL is an accounting asymmetry between loan-related income, recognized periodically based on\nthe effective interest method, and credit losses, recognized upfront at origination. This asymmetry might create the perception\nof reduced profitability during loan expansion periods due to the immediate recognition of expected credit losses. Conversely,\nperiods with stable or declining loan levels might seem relatively more profitable as income accrues gradually for loans where\nlosses had been previously recognized.\nAs a result of the change in methodology from the incurred loss model to the CECL model, on January 1, 2023, the\nCompany recorded a one-time charge, net of tax, of $395,000 to retained earnings and a $500,000 increase to the ACL.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data and Fraud\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber-attack. Communications and information\nsystems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general\nledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of\nconfidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor\nto modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to\nbreaches, fraudulent or unauthorized access, denial or degradation of service attacks, misuse, computer viruses, malware or\nother malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could\njeopardize our or our customers’ confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our\ncomputer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our\n41\ncustomers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures\nor to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that\nare either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant\nreputational damage.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our\nreputation. Increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries,\nvulnerabilities in third party technologies (including browsers and operating systems), or other developments could result in a\ncompromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect\ndata about us, our customers and underlying transactions. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from\nusing our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet\nsecurity systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. Although we have\ndeveloped and continue to invest in systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-\nattacks and periodically test our security, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our\nsecurity measures, and could result in losses to us or our customers, our loss of business and/or customers, damage to our\nreputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, disruption to our business, our inability to grow our online services or other\nbusinesses, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur security measures may not protect us from system failures or interruptions. While we have established policies\nand procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events\nwill not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data\nprocessing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. While we select third-party vendors carefully, we do\nnot control their actions. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, including those resulting from breakdowns or other\ndisruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher transaction\nvolumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches, or if we otherwise have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to\nadequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our ability to deliver products and services to our\ncustomers and otherwise conduct business operations could be adversely impacted. Replacing these third-party vendors could\nalso entail significant delay and expense. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information\nthrough various other vendors and their personnel.\nWe cannot assure you that such breaches, failures or interruptions will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be\nadequately addressed by us or the third parties on which we rely. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of\nthird party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from breaches, system failures or\nother disruptions. If any of our third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if\nthere is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to identify alternative sources of such services,\nand we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar\nfunctionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence\nof any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject\nus to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our data management or aggregation.\nWe are reliant on our ability to manage data and our ability to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner to\nensure effective risk reporting and management. Our ability to manage data and aggregate data may be limited by the\neffectiveness of our policies, programs, processes and practices that govern how data is acquired, validated, stored, protected\nand processed. While we continuously update our policies, programs, processes and practices, many of our data management\nand aggregation processes are manual and subject to human error or system failure. Failure to manage data effectively and to\naggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risks, as well as to\nmanage changing business needs.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nThe Bank is susceptible to fraudulent activity that may be committed against us or our customers which may result in\nfinancial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customer’s\ninformation, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such\nfraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and\n42\nother dishonest acts. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also\nexperienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent\nsuch losses, there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry Generally\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on numerous external vendors to provide us with products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day\noperations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the\ncontracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the\ncontracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendor's organizational structure, financial\ncondition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our\noperations, which in turn could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also\ncould be adversely affected to the extent a service agreement is not renewed by the third-party vendor or is renewed on terms\nless favorable to us. Additionally, the bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to be responsible for all aspects of\ntheir vendors’ performance, including aspects which they delegate to third parties.\nIneffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nEffective liquidity management is essential to our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan\nrequests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash\ncommitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances, including events causing industry\nor general financial market stress. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or investment\nsecurities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. We rely on customer deposits and at times,\nborrowings from the FHLB of Des Moines and certain other wholesale funding sources to fund our operations. Deposit flows\nand the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of\ninterest rates, whether actual or perceived, and the competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve. Further, changes\nto the FHLB of Des Moines's underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our\nability to borrow, and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity.\nAlthough we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and borrowings if desired, we may not be able to\nreplace such funds in the future if, among other things, our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market\nconditions change. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our\nbusiness activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans and deposits are concentrated, negative operating\nresults, or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to\nus, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services\nindustry or deterioration in credit markets. Any decline in available funding in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on\nterms which are acceptable could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or\nfulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available\nwhen it is needed, or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. At\nsome point, we may need to raise additional capital to support our growth or replenish future losses. Our ability to raise\nadditional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on\nour financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional\ncapital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to\nfurther expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and\nadversely affected. In addition, any additional capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of\nour common stock. Further, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators, we may be subject\nto adverse regulatory action.\n43\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely\naffect our prospects.\nCompetition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of\nqualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the community banking industry where First Financial Northwest Bank\nconducts its business. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our\nstrategies is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified\nmanagement, loan origination, finance, administrative, marketing, and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions\nof our management and personnel. In particular, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of\nkey executives, including our President, and certain other employees. In addition, our success has been and continues to be\nhighly dependent upon the services of our directors, many of whom are at or nearing retirement age, and we may not be able to\nidentify and attract suitable candidates to replace such directors.\nWe participate in a multiple employer defined benefit pension plan for the benefit of our employees. If we were to\nwithdraw from this plan, or if Pentegra, the multiple employer defined benefit pension plan sponsor, requires us to\nmake additional contributions, we could incur a substantial expense in connection with the withdrawal or the request\nfor additional contributions.\nWe participate in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions, a multiple employer pension plan for the\nbenefit of our employees. Effective March 31, 2013, we did not allow additional employees to participate in this plan and froze\nthe future accrual of benefits under this plan with respect to those participating employees. In connection with our decision to\nfreeze our benefit accruals under the plan, and since then, we considered withdrawing from the plan. If we choose to withdraw\nfrom the plan, we could incur a substantial expense in connection with the withdrawal. The actual expense that would be\nincurred in connection with a withdrawal from the plan is primarily dependent upon the timing of the withdrawal, the total\nvalue of the plan’s assets at the time of withdrawal, general market interest rates at that time, expenses imposed on withdrawal,\nand other conditions imposed by Pentegra as set forth in the plan.\nEven if we do not withdraw from the plan, Pentegra, as sponsor of the plan, may request that we make an additional\ncontribution to the plan, in addition to contributions that we are regularly required to make, or obtain a letter of credit in favor\nof the plan, if our financial condition worsens to the point that it triggers certain criteria set out in the plan. If we fail to make\nthe contribution or obtain the requested letter of credit, then we may be forced to withdraw from the plan and establish a\nseparate, single employer defined benefit plan that we anticipate would be underfunded to a similar extent as under the multiple\nemployer plan.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of our revenue at the holding company level.\nFirst Financial Northwest is an entity separate and distinct from our principal subsidiary, the Bank, and derives\nsubstantially all of its revenue at the holding company level in the form of dividends from the Bank. Accordingly, First Federal\nNorthwest is, and will be, dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness, to\nsatisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on its common stock. The Bank’s ability to pay dividends is subject to its\nability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements, including the capital conservation buffer requirement. In\nthe event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to First Financial Northwest, it may not be able to pay dividends on its common\nstock or repurchase its stock.\nIf we fail to meet the expectations of our stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)\npractices, including those relating to sustainability, it may have an adverse effect on our reputation and results of\noperation.\nOur reputation may also be negatively impacted by our diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) efforts if they fall short\nof expectations. In addition, various private third-party organizations have developed ratings processes for evaluating\ncompanies on their approach to ESG and DEI matters. These ratings may be used by some investors to assist with their\ninvestment and voting decisions. Any unfavorable ratings may lead to reputational damage and negative sentiment among our\ninvestors and other stakeholders. Furthermore, increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall\noperational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and\nstandards could negatively impact our reputation to do business with certain partners, and our stock price. New government\nregulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary\nreporting, diligence, and disclosure.\n44\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nFirst Financial Northwest has not received any written comments from the SEC regarding its periodic or current\nreports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nOur cybersecurity risk management and strategy are integrated into our enterprise-wide risk management (ERM)\nprogram, which leverages a \"three lines of defense\" model to manage risk within the organization. Such model incorporates\n1) day-to-day/operational activities and controls that are managed at the business unit level; 2) identification, measurement and\nmitigation of inherent security risks via the use of internal control and cybersecurity maturity frameworks, operating policies,\nindependent monitoring, risk management and compliance oversight; and 3) internal audit designed to provide objective and\nindependent validation of the design and operating effectiveness of cybersecurity and information security controls.\nTechnology risk (including cybersecurity and overall operational risk) is identified as a key risk area for the Company, and\nutilizes a combination of manual and automated methods as well as internal and external resources to monitor, measure and\nmitigate cybersecurity risks.\nThe ability to mitigate cybersecurity risks is dependent upon an effective risk assessment process that identifies,\nmeasures, controls, and monitors material risks stemming from cybersecurity threats. These threats include any potential\nunauthorized activities occurring through the Company's information systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality,\nintegrity, or availability of the Company's information systems or the data contained therein. The Company's Information\nSecurity Program includes a comprehensive information security risk assessment process that incorporates the following\nelements:\n1. Identification of reasonably foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized disclosure,\nmisuse, alteration, or destruction of confidential information or information systems.\n2. Assessment of the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of\nconfidential information.\n3. Assessment of the sufficiency of policies, procedures, information systems, and other arrangements in place to control\nrisks.\nThe risk assessment process is designed to identify assets requiring risk reduction strategies and includes an evaluation\nof the key factors applicable to the operation. The Company conducts a variety of information security assessments throughout\nthe year, both internally and through third-party specialists.\nIn designing our Information Security Program, we refer to established industry frameworks - in particular, the Federal\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and guidance and best practices from the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (NIST). The FFIEC framework offers a set of guidelines to help financial institutions effectively manage and\nmitigate cybersecurity risks. The framework focuses on ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive\ninformation and systems. NIST is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce and among other initiatives, develops\ncybersecurity standards, guidelines, and other resources to meet the needs of U.S. industry, federal agencies and the broader\npublic. Activities range from producing specific information that organizations can put into practice immediately to longer-term\nresearch that anticipates advances in technologies and future challenges. The Company utilizes these frameworks to assist with\nthe design of our Information Security Program, including risk mitigation controls and processes. While we believe our\ninformation security program is well-designed and appropriate for our organization, the sophistication of cyber threats\ncontinues to increase and the Company's cybersecurity risk management and strategy may be insufficient and may not be\nsuccessful in protecting against all cyber incidents. Accordingly, no matter how well designed or implemented the Company's\ncontrols are, it may not be able to anticipate all cyber security breaches, and it may not be able to implement effective\npreventive measures against such security breaches in a timely manner. For more information on how cybersecurity risk may\naffect the Company's business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, please refer to Item I A. Risk Factors -\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data and Fraud.\nThe Company uses a cross-functional approach to identify, prevent, and mitigate cybersecurity threats and incidents.\nWe have adopted controls and procedures that provide for the prompt escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents so that\ndecisions regarding the public disclosure and reporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner. We\nhave developed a formal cybersecurity incident response plan that summarizes the steps the Company will take to respond to a\n45\ncybersecurity incident. The plan includes an Incident Response Team (IRT), which is responsible for addressing and\ncoordinating all aspects of the Company's response to cybersecurity events. The IRT is supported by operating procedures and\nguidelines designed to outline the expectations and processes to be followed when responding to incidents of unauthorized\naccess to confidential information maintained by the Company or its service providers. The IRT may consult legal counsel and\nother external experts in connection with their respective activities. An escalation process has been established for engaging\nother resources and appropriate reporting protocols at both the management and Board of Directors levels.\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors has adopted, and reviews annually, a Risk Appetite Statement that articulates the Company's\nattitude towards risk. The Company's Risk Appetite Statement identifies key risk categories and establishes risk tolerances for\neach. Associated risk metrics are monitored quarterly by Management and reported to the Audit/Compliance/Risk (ACR)\nCommittee of the Board and the Board of Directors. Management measures and reports inherent risk, mitigating controls,\nresidual risk and emerging risk for various key risk categories, inclusive of cybersecurity and information security risks.\nThe Company's governance and oversight of cybersecurity risks are facilitated through our Information Security\nProgram, which establishes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the confidential information\nand records of all the Bank's clients in accordance with FDIC regulations. Our Information Security Program, along with its\nassociated policies and guidelines, takes into account FDIC and FFIEC regulations and guidance on sensitive information\nprotection as well as information system security. It is tailored to align with the Company's risk assessment results, and the size,\ncomplexity, nature and scope of our activities.\nWe maintain relevant expertise within the Bank's management team to manage cybersecurity risks. In particular, the\nBank's Information Security Officer (“ISO”) reports directly to the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) and provides direction and\noversight for information and cyber-security related activities across the Company—including existing and emerging initiatives,\nservice provider arrangements, incident response, business continuity management, staff training, monitoring of key controls\nand adjusting the information security program in response to changes in operations and internal/external threats and\nvulnerabilities. The ISO has more than 20 years of information security experience at financial institutions as well as\ninformation security consulting firms, and maintains various cybersecurity and IT audit professional certifications. The ISO\nworks in partnership with the Company’s Information Technology department and is supported by both internal and external\ninformation technology and information security tools, resources and staff.\nBoth the CRO and ISO provide routine reports to various management committees and at the Board level—namely the\nACR Committee and the Board of Directors—regarding the overall status of the Information Security Program. Such reporting\nencompasses various aspects, such as risk assessment, risk management and control decisions, service provider arrangements,\nresults of independent testing, cybersecurity incidents or violations and Management's responses, and recommendations for\nchanges to the Information Security Program. The Board of Directors plays a crucial role, annually reviewing and approving\nour Information Security Program. The Board oversees efforts to develop, implement, and maintain an effective Information\nSecurity Program, including reviewing Management's reporting on program effectiveness. Additionally, the Board of Directors'\nCorporate Governance/Nominating Committee considers information technology and cybersecurity expertise when assessing\npotential director candidates, to help ensure the Board of Directors has the capability to appropriately oversee Management's\nactivities in these areas.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe corporate office for the Company is located at 201 Wells Avenue South, Renton, Washington and is owned by us.\nThe Bank’s full service retail operation is also at this location. In addition, the Bank owns a retail office located at 17424 SR 9,\nSnohomish, Washington. At December 31, 2023, the Bank had 13 leased locations in Washington currently in operation: Mill\nCreek, Edmonds, “The Landing” in Renton, Bellevue, Bothell, Woodinville, Smokey Point, Lake Stevens, Kent, Kirkland,\nUniversity Place, Gig Harbor, and Issaquah. The lending division operations of the Bank are at our owned location at 207 Wells\nAvenue South, Renton, Washington. The lease terms for our properties are for an initial term of three to five years with the\noption to extend for additional three to five year periods. In the opinion of management, all properties are adequately covered\nby insurance, are in a good state of repair and are appropriately designed for their present and future use. For additional\ninformation on our lease commitments, see Note 10- “Leases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of\nthis report.\n46\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we are involved as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of\nbusiness. As of December 31, 2023, we were not involved in any significant litigation and do not anticipate incurring any\nmaterial liability as a result of any such litigation.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nOur common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC’s Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”), under the\nsymbol “FFNW.” As of March 8, 2024, there were approximately 466 shareholders of record, excluding persons or entities that\nhold stock in nominee or “street name” accounts with brokers.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Board of Directors had declared 43 consecutive quarterly cash dividends on our\ncommon stock. Our cash dividend payout policy is reviewed regularly by management and the Board of Directors. Any\ndividends declared and paid in the future would depend upon a number of factors, including capital requirements, our financial\ncondition and results of operations, tax considerations, statutory and regulatory limitations, and general economic conditions.\nNo assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in future periods.\nOur future payment of dividends may depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from the Bank, which are restricted by federal\nregulations.\nStock Repurchases\nThe following table represents First Financial Northwest common shares repurchased during the fourth quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nTotal Number of Maximum\nShares Number of Shares\nRepurchased as that May Yet Be\nTotal Number of Average Price Part of Publicly Repurchased\nPeriod Shares Purchased Paid per Share Announced Plan Under the Plan(1)\nOctober 1 - October 31, 2023 — $ — — 457,000\nNovember 1 - November 30, 2023 — — — 457,000\nDecember 1 - December 31, 2023 — — — 457,000\n— — —\n(1) On August 7, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up 5% of the\nCompany’s outstanding common stock, or approximately 457,000 shares. The August 2023 stock repurchase program\ncommenced on August 10, 2023, and will expire no later than March 16, 2024. The extent to which the Company repurchases\nits shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations. As a\nresult, there can be no assurance as to the exact number of shares, if any, that will be repurchased under the plan.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nThe equity compensation plan information presented under subparagraph (d) in Part III, Item 12 of this report is\nincorporated herein by reference.\nItem 6. Reserved\n47\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data for the\nyears ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results\nof operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes\nthereto that appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with\nthese Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the business and financial information provided in this Form 10-K.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this section reflects the consolidated financial condition and\nresults of operations of First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nFirst Financial Northwest Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest and, as such, comprises\nsubstantially all of the activity for First Financial Northwest. The Bank was a community-based savings bank until February 4,\n2016, when the Bank converted to a Washington state chartered commercial bank reflecting the commercial banking services it\nnow provides to its customers. The Bank primarily serves King, Snohomish, Pierce and Kitsap counties, Washington through\nits full-service banking office and headquarters in Renton, Washington, as well as seven retail branches in King County,\nWashington, five retail branches in Snohomish County, Washington, and two retail branches in Pierce County, Washington at\nDecember 31, 2023. The Bank purchased four of these branches in 2017 and acquired $74.7 million in deposits (the “Branch\nAcquisition”). The Branch Acquisition expanded our retail footprint and provided an opportunity to extend our unique brand of\ncommunity banking into those communities.\nThe Bank’s business consists predominantly of attracting deposits from the general public, combined with borrowing\nfrom the FHLB and raising funds in the wholesale market, then utilizing these funds to originate one-to-four family residential,\nmultifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land, business, and consumer loans. The Bank’s strategic initiatives seek to\ndiversify our loan portfolio and broaden growth opportunities with our current risk tolerance levels and asset/liability\nobjectives. Our business strategy emphasizes commercial real estate, construction, one-to-four family residential, and\nmultifamily lending. During 2023, loan originations, refinances and purchases outpaced repayments of loans, resulting in an\nincrease of $8.8 million in net loans receivable with a balance of $1.18 billion at December 31, 2023.\nWe continued to geographically expand our loan portfolio through purchases of consumer classic and collectible car\nloans, that are outside of our primary market area. While the total volume of loan purchases and participations in 2023\ndecreased compared to 2022, our loan portfolio experienced a positive net change with an aggregate addition of $22.0 million\nfrom these programs during 2023.\nIn our commitment to diversify beyond the State of Washington, our portfolio included $152.8 million in loans to\nborrowers or secured by properties located in 46 other states, along with Washington, D.C. As of December 31, 2023, the\nlargest concentrations were in California, Florida, Texas, Oregon, and Alabama, totaling $35.1 million, $11.4 million,\n$10.2 million, $10.0 million and $7.8 million of loans, respectively.\nThe Bank has affiliated with a SBA partner to process our SBA loans while the Bank retains the credit decisions. This\nenables us to be active in lending to small businesses until our volumes are high enough to support the investment in necessary\ninfrastructure. When volumes support our becoming a SBA preferred lender, we will apply for that status which would provide\nthe Bank with delegated loan approval as well as closing and most servicing and liquidation authority, enabling the Bank to\nmake loan decisions more rapidly. In addition, the Bank plans to increase originations of the business loan portfolio, which may\ninclude business lines of credit, business term loans or equipment financing. In conjunction with the growth of business loans,\nthe Bank seeks to service these customers with their business deposits as well.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $6.3 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to\n$13.2 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The primary contributor to this decrease was a\n$7.8 million decrease in net interest income as our increase in interest expense significantly outpaced our increase in interest\nincome. In addition, we recorded a recapture of the provision for credit losses of $208,000 in 2023, compared to a $434,000\nrecapture in 2022, primarily due to credit upgrades and payoffs of loans carrying higher credit risk ratings, updates to economic\nforecasts used for loans and unfunded commitments, changes in the loan portfolio balances, mix and characteristics and other\nfactors. The decrease in net income was further impacted by a $474,000 reduction in noninterest income and a $41,000 increase\nin noninterest expense.\n48\nOur primary source of revenue is interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments.\nInterest expense is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between\ninterest income and interest expense. Changes in levels of interest rates affect interest income and interest expense differently\nand, thus, impacts our net interest income. The Bank is currently liability sensitive, meaning our interest-bearing liabilities\nreprice at a faster rate than our interest-earning assets. Our net interest margin decreased compared to the prior year. The\naverage yield on interest-earning assets increased, primarily due to an increase in market interest rates. For the same reason,\naverage cost of funds also increased, but at a faster pace than the average yield on interest earning assets.\nAs our loan portfolio increases, or due to an increase for expected losses in our loan portfolio, our ACL may increase,\nresulting in a decrease to net interest income after the provision for credit losses. Improvements in loan risk ratings, increases in\nproperty values, or receipt of recoveries of amounts previously charged off may partially or fully offset any required increase to\nACL due to loan growth or an increase in expected loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded\na recapture of provision in the amount of $208,000.\nNoninterest income is generated from various loan or deposit fees, increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned\nlife insurance (“BOLI”), and revenue earned on our wealth management services and is also affected by any net gain or loss on\nsales of investment securities. Our noninterest income decreased $474,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to 2022, primarily attributable to a $495,000 decrease in loan prepayment penalties.\nOur noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, regulatory\nassessments, occupancy and equipment, and other general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist\nprimarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement, and other employee benefits.\nProfessional fees include legal services, auditing and accounting services, computer support services, and other professional\nservices in support of strategic plans. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings\nand equipment, consist primarily of lease expenses, real estate taxes, depreciation expenses, maintenance, and costs of utilities.\nWe have continued our effort to proactively control our expenses. As a result, our noninterest expense for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 had little change from the year ended December 31, 2022. The slight increase of $41,000 in noninterest\nexpense was primarily due to a $360,000 increase in regulatory assessments resulting from FDIC’s increasing deposit insurance\nassessment rate effective this year, a $304,000 increase in other general and administrative expense, due to a number of factors,\nincluding increased state/local taxes, business development efforts and deposit related expenses reflecting implementation of\nnew deposit programs in the year, and a $179,000 increase in data processing. These increases were partially offset by a\n$767,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits due to several factors, including lower expenses from the replacement of\nthe ESOP by the new profit-sharing plan, lower commission and loan direct cost offset expense resulting due to lower loan\norigination and a $51,000 decrease in consulting service expense which was part of professional services. Other changes in\nprofessional service fees were a $268,000 increase in other professional service expense, primarily resulted from a $419,000\nexpense related to the unsuccessful negotiation of a potential business combination with another financial institution during the\nsecond quarter of the year. This increase was offset by a $163,000 decrease in legal fees and a $106,000 decrease in audit/\naccounting services/examination fees.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur long-term business strategy is to operate and grow the Bank as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank,\noffering one-to-four family residential, commercial and multifamily, construction/land, consumer and business loans along with\na diversified array of deposit and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas. We intend to\naccomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise, capital strength, and loan production capability by:\n• Capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers,\nand delivering a consistent, high-quality level of professional service;\n• Offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to diversify our deposit mix, growing lower\ncost deposits, attracting new customers, and expanding our footprint in the geographical area we serve;\n• Utilizing wholesale funding sources, including but not limited to FHLB advances and acquiring deposits in the\nnational brokered certificate of deposit market, to assist with funding needs and interest rate risk management efforts,\nas needed;\n• Managing our loan portfolio to minimize concentration risk and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio;\n• Managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin; and\n49\n• Improving profitability through disciplined pricing, expense control and balance sheet management, while continuing\nto provide excellent customer service.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates\nand assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time\nthe estimate was made, and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different\nestimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or\nresults of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates on past\nexperience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on\nan ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our Board of Directors.\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nAllowance for Credit Losses. Management recognizes that credit losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the\nACL must be maintained at a level necessary to cover estimated credit losses over the life of an exposure. The ACL is an\nestimate of the expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost using the relevant information about the\npast events, including historical credit loss experience on loans with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the\nfinancial assets. Our methodology for analyzing the ACL comprises two components: the general allowance and the specific\nallowance. The general allowance establishes a reserve rate using historical life-of-loan default rates, current loan portfolio\ninformation, economic forecasts, and business cycle data. Statistical analysis determines life-of-loan default and loss rates for\nthe quantitative component, while qualitative factors (\"Q-Factors\") adjust expected loss rates for current and forecasted\nconditions. The Q-Factor methodology involves a blend of quantitative analysis and management judgment, reviewed quarterly.\nSpecific allowances arise when individual loans exhibit unique risk characteristics, leading to an impairment analysis. If\nmanagement believes that scheduled principal and interest payments will not be fully paid, and the recorded investment is less\nthan the market value of the collateral, a specific reserve is established in the ACL for the loan. The specific reserve amount is\ncalculated using current appraisals, listed sales prices, and other available information. This analysis is subject to inherent\nsubjectivity, relying on estimates that may be revised as more information becomes available.\nOur Board of Directors’ Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends for approval the allowance for\ncredit losses on a quarterly basis, and any related provision or recapture of provision for credit losses, and the Board of\nDirectors approves the provision or recapture after considering the Committee’s recommendations. The allowance is increased\nby the provision for credit losses which is charged against current period earnings. When analysis of the loan/AFS investment\nportfolio warrants, the allowance is decreased and a recapture of provision of credit losses is included in current period\nearnings.\nWe believe that the ACL is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from\nperiod-to-period requiring management to make assumptions about expected credit losses of the loan portfolio. The impact of a\nlarge unexpected loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance,\nthereby reducing earnings. For additional information see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Lending - Our\nallowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio,” in this Form 10-K.\n50\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nAssets. The following table details the changes in the composition of our assets at December 31, 2023 from\nDecember 31, 2022.\nBalance at Balance at\nDecember 31, December 31, $ %\n2023 2022 Change Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash on hand and in banks $ 8,391 $ 7,722 $ 669 8.7 %\nInterest-earning deposits with banks 22,138 16,598 5,540 33.4\nInvestments available-for-sale, at fair value 207,915 217,778 (9,863) (4.5)\nInvestments held-to-maturity, at amortized cost 2,456 2,444 12 0.5\nLoans receivable, net 1,175,925 1,167,083 8,842 0.8\nFHLB stock, at cost 6,527 7,512 (985) (13.1)\nAccrued interest receivable 7,359 6,513 846 13.0\nDeferred tax assets, net 2,648 2,597 51 2.0\nPremises and equipment, net 19,667 21,192 (1,525) (7.2)\nBOLI 37,653 36,286 1,367 3.8\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 10,478 12,479 (2,001) (16.0)\nRight of use asset (“ROU”), net 2,617 3,275 (658) (20.1)\nGoodwill 889 889 — —\nCore deposit intangible, net 419 548 (129) (23.5)\nTotal assets $ 1,505,082 $ 1,502,916 $ 2,166 0.1 %\nThe $2.2 million increase in total assets during 2023 was primarily a result of growth in our loan portfolio of\n$8.8 million, funded by growth in deposits, primarily retail certificates of deposit and principal repayments on our investment\nsecurities. Additional factors in our asset growth are described below.\nInterest-earning deposits with banks. Interest-earning deposits with banks, consisting primarily of funds held at the\nFRB, increased by $5.5 million from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023, primarily due to management’s electing to\nmaintain additional on-balance sheet liquidity in light of the volatility in the banking industry. Excess funds were deposited to\nour interest-earning accounts with banks and are readily available for our funding needs.\nInvestments available-for-sale. During 2023, investments available-for-sale decreased $9.9 million, primarily due to\nregularly scheduled principal payments on mortgage-backed securities. No investments securities were purchased during 2023.\nThe effective duration of our securities portfolio decreased slightly to 3.43% at December 31, 2023, as compared to\n3.65% at December 31, 2022. Effective duration measures the anticipated percentage change in the value of an investment (or\nportfolio) in the event of a 100 basis point change in market yields. Since the Bank’s portfolio includes securities with\nembedded options (including call options on bonds and prepayment options on mortgage-backed securities), management\nbelieves that effective duration is an appropriate metric to use as a tool when analyzing the Bank’s investment securities\nportfolio, as effective duration incorporates assumptions relating to such embedded options, including changes in cash flow\nassumptions as interest rates change.\nLoans receivable. Net loans receivable increased by $8.8 million during 2023 to $1.18 billion. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, one-to-four family loans increased $39.0 million, multifamily loans increased $11.3 million and consumer\nloans, consistent with management’s strategy to increase the Bank’s portfolio of classic and collectible car loans, increased\n$7.6 million. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases in commercial real estate loans of $30.0 million, construction/\nland loans of $16.7 million, and business loans of $2.3 million.\nDuring 2023, we supplemented our loan originations and participations by purchasing $21.9 million in loans, including\n$19.8 million of performing classic and collectible car loans, and $2.1 million of CRA qualified one-to-four family loans. These\n51\nout-of-state purchases reflect our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with loans meeting our investment and\ncredit quality objectives.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank had $220,000 of nonaccrual loans. Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of our total\nloans was 0.02% at both December 31, 2023 and 2022. Adversely classified loans, defined as substandard or below, decreased\nto $46.1 million at December 31, 2023, from $47.2 million at December 31, 2022 due primarily to principal paydowns, partially\noffset by a downgrade of a $293,000 one-to-four family loan from special mention to substandard. All substandard loans at\nDecember 31, 2023, were considered collateral dependent and individually evaluated for a specific allowance. The Bank is\nmonitoring these loans closely, all of which remain current on their payment obligations, and does not expect to incur any\nmaterial losses.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our nonaccrual loans at the dates indicated.\nDecember 31,\n$\n2023 2022 Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans:\nConsumer $ 220 $ 193 $ 27\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 220 $ 193 $ 27\nThe Bank did not foreclose on any properties during either 2023 or 2022. There was no LIP related to nonperforming\nloans at December 31, 2023 or 2022. The level of our nonperforming assets reflects the modest risk profile of our loan\nportfolio and our commitment to promptly identify any problem loans and take prompt actions to turn nonperforming assets\ninto performing assets.\nAllowance for credit losses. We believe that we use the best information available to establish the ACL, and that the\nACL as of December 31, 2023 was adequate to cover the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio at that date. While we\nbelieve the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the ACL are reasonable, there can be no\nassurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future\nprovisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not\nadversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the ACL may become necessary based\nupon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan\nbalances, or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ACL\nis subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process that may result in the establishment of\nadditional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of\ninformation available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe ACL was $15.3 million, or 1.28% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2023 as compared to $15.2 million, or\n1.29% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2022. The following table details activity and information related to the ACL\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n52\nAt or For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nACL balance at beginning of year $ 15,227 $ 15,657\nAdjustment for adoption of Topic 326 500 —\nRecapture of provision for credit losses - loans (400) (400)\nCharge-offs (22) (37)\nRecoveries 1 7\nACL balance at end of year $ 15,306 $ 15,227\nACL as a percent of total loans 1.28 % 1.29 %\nACL as a percent of nonaccrual loans 6,957.27 % 7,889.78 %\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 220 $ 193\nNonaccrual loans as a percent of total loans 0.02 % 0.02 %\nTotal loans receivable $ 1,191,231 $ 1,182,310\nTotal loans originated 181,156 271,403\nIntangible assets. As a result of the Branch Acquisition in 2017, we recognized goodwill of $889,000 and a CDI of\n$1.3 million. The Company performed an impairment analysis at December 31, 2023, and determined that no impairment of\ngoodwill and CDI existed. However, if adverse economic conditions or a decrease in the Company’s stock price and market\ncapitalization were to be deemed sustained rather than temporary, it may significantly affect the fair value of our goodwill.\nThe CDI was provided by a third-party valuation service and represents the fair value of the customer relationships\nthat provide a low-cost source of funding. The analysis was performed on the acquired noninterest-bearing checking, interest-\nbearing checking, savings, and money market accounts. The initial ratio of CDI to the acquired balances of core deposits was\n2.23%. This amount is amortized into noninterest expense on an accelerated basis over ten years and had a balance of $419,000\nat December 31, 2023.\nDeposits. During the year ended December 31, 2023, deposits increased $24.1 million from December 31, 2022.\nDetails of deposit balances and their concentrations are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNoninterest-bearing demand\ndeposits $ 100,899 8.4 % $ 119,944 10.3 %\nInterest-bearing demand deposits 56,968 4.8 96,632 8.3\nSavings 18,886 1.6 23,636 2.0\nMoney market 529,411 44.3 542,388 46.4\nCertificates of deposit, retail 357,153 29.9 262,554 22.3\nBrokered deposits (1) 130,790 11.0 124,886 10.7\nTotal deposits $ 1,194,107 100.0 % $ 1,170,040 100.0 %\n____________\n(1) Brokered deposits at December 31, 2023 and 2022, were comprised of $95.2 million and $89.8 million of certificates of\ndeposit, $25.1 million and $25.1 million of interest-bearing demand deposits, and $10.4 million and $10.0 million of money\nmarket deposits, respectively.\nThe growth in deposits during 2023 was primarily attributed to a $94.6 million increase in retail certificates of deposit\ndue in large part to promotions of these products during the year. The Bank’s strategic initiatives seek to diversify our loan\nportfolio and broaden growth opportunities within our current risk tolerance levels and asset/liability objectives. When retail\ndeposit balances do not meet our funding needs, we utilize brokered deposits, the national deposit marketplace and other\n53\nwholesale funding sources. These funds are used to fund loan origination and support other operation needs. During 2023, the\nCompany increased its usage of brokered deposits, in particular brokered certificates of deposit, due in large part to the stability\nof such deposits. While the rates paid on brokered deposit are generally higher than retail deposits obtained through our branch\nnetwork, brokered deposit customers do not have the ability to withdraw these deposits, making such deposits very valuable in\ntimes of volatility in the banking industry. With the turmoil in markets created by the failure of financial institutions in the first\nquarter of 2023, the industry’s focus on liquidity and stability of deposits increased materially. This was the primary factor that\ninfluenced the increase use of brokered deposits in 2023, with the average balance of brokered deposits increasing to\n$162.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from an average balance of $41.6 million during 2022. The increases in\nretail and brokered certificates of deposit were partially offset by a $19.0 million decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits, a\n$39.7 million decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits, a $4.8 million decrease in savings and a $13.0 million in money\nmarket accounts.\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we held $85.8 million and $61.0 million in public funds, of which\n$39.4 million and $20.1 million were retail certificates of deposits, respectively. These funds were secured with the Washington\nState Public Deposit Protection Commission by $26.5 million in pledged investment securities.\nAdvances. We use advances from the FHLB as an alternative funding source to manage interest rate risk, to leverage\nour balance sheet and to supplement our deposits. FHLB advances at December 31, 2023 were $125.0 million compared to\n$145.0 million at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, our FHLB advances consisted of $25.0 million of fixed-rate\nthree-month advances that renew quarterly, $90.0 million of fixed-rate one-month advances that renew monthly, all of which\nare utilized in cash flow hedge agreements, as described below, and $10.0 million of overnight FHLB advances. The\navailability of overnight FHLB advances provides us flexibility to adjust the level of our borrowings as our funding needs\nchange, consistent with our asset/liability objectives. Average borrowings during 2023 were $127.3 million. At December 31,\n2023, all of our FHLB advances were due to mature in less than two months.\nCash Flow Hedge. To assist in managing interest rate risk, the Bank enters into interest rate swap agreements with\nqualified institutions designated as cash flow hedge instruments. On July 17, 2023, the Bank entered into two new interest rate\nswap agreements with qualified institutions. One agreement had a $15.0 million notional amount, a two-year maturity and a\nfixed rate of 4.57%. The second agreement had a $15.0 million notional amount, a three-year maturity and a fixed rate of\n4.15%. On November 20, 2023, a $10.0 million notional swap with a four-year maturity and a fixed rate of 1.59% matured and\nwas not replaced. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had eight interest rate swap agreements. These agreements had an\naggregate notional amount of $115.0 million, with individual notional amounts ranging from $10.0 million to $15.0 million, a\nweighted-average remaining term of 3.0 years and a weighted-average fixed rate of 1.87%. The remaining maturity of these\nagreements is from eight months to 5.8 years.\nUnder the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the Bank pays a fixed interest rate and in return receives an\ninterest payment based on the corresponding SOFR index, which resets quarterly or monthly, depending on the hedge term.\nConcurrently, the Bank borrowed a fixed rate FHLB advance that will be renewed quarterly or monthly, as designated by the\nhedge agreement, at the fixed interest rate at that time. Effectiveness of the interest rate swap is evaluated quarterly with any\nineffectiveness recognized as a gain or a loss on the income statement in noninterest income. A change in the fair value of the\ncash flow hedge created by the interest rate swap agreements is recognized as an other asset or other liability on the balance\nsheet with the tax-effected portion of the change included in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2023, we\nrecognized a $7.6 million fair value asset as a result of the increase in market value of the interest rate swap agreements.\nStockholders’ Equity. Total stockholders’ equity increased to $161.7 million at December 31, 2023, from\n$160.4 million at December 31, 2022. Increases to stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2023, included\n$6.3 million of net income and $605,000 in stock-based compensation recognized as additional paid-in-capital over the vesting\nperiods of the stock awards. In addition, the exercise of stock options resulted in the issuance of 95,019 shares of common stock\nand a $1.0 million increase to additional paid-in capital.\nThese increases were partially offset by a $459,000 other comprehensive loss from the decrease in fair value of our\nderivative portfolio, partially offset by increases in value of our available-for-sale investments. These increases were further\noffset by a $395,000 net of tax adjustment to retained earnings resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and a $1.0 million\ndecrease to additional paid-in-capital from the cancellation of 83,722 shares of stock awards. In addition, shareholder cash\ndividends of $0.52 per share were paid during 2023, reducing retained earnings by $4.8 million.\n54\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in 2023 was $40.5 million, a $7.8 million or 16.2% decrease from\n$48.4 million in 2022, due primarily to a $26.7 million increase in interest expense outpacing the $18.9 million increase in\ninterest income. The increase in interest income was primarily due to the increase in average yield on interest-earning assets to\n5.44% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2022, a result of increases in\nmarket interest rates during the year and our deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets. Average interest-\nearning assets increased $69.0 million, fully funded by a $83.5 million increase in interest-bearing liabilities. The average cost\nof interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.05% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 0.95% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, as a result of the persistently elevated short-term interest rates and the change in the Company’s deposit\nmix. In 2023, our average balance of interest-bearing demand, savings, money market and noninterest-bearing deposits\ndecreased $21.1 million, $3.2 million, $95.6 million and $15.4 million, respectively, contributing to the need to increase usage\nof brokered deposits and other funding alternatives. As a result, average balance of brokered deposits increased to\n$162.2 million at December 31, 2023 from an average balance of $41.6 million at December 31, 2022. The average balance of\nthe retail certificates of deposit increased $69.4 million during 2023 compared to 2022 due in large part to promotions of these\nproducts this year. As a result of our utilizing higher costing brokered deposits to meet our funding needs in 2023, our net\ninterest margin decreased to 2.82% for the year ended December 31, 2023, from 3.53% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFor more information, see “Asset and Liability Management and Market Risk.”\nThe following table compares average interest-earning asset balances, associated yields, and resulting changes in\ninterest and dividend income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nChange in\nAverage Average Interest and\nBalance Yield Balance Yield Dividend Income\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLoans receivable, net $ 1,172,569 5.71 % $ 1,128,835 4.69 % $ 14,003\nInvestments 213,261 3.97 203,148 2.76 2,871\nInterest-earning deposits 44,684 5.06 30,176 1.28 1,875\nFHLB stock 6,857 7.07 6,256 5.08 167\nTotal interest-earning assets $ 1,437,371 5.44 % $ 1,368,415 4.33 % $ 18,916\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, interest income on net loans receivable increased $14.0 million due to\nincreases in the average yield and, to a lesser extent, the average balance of loans. The average loan yield increased to 5.71%\nfrom 4.69% and the average balance of loans receivable increased $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to loans originated or refinanced at higher rates or adjusted\nupward in this rising rate environment.\nInterest income on investments available-for-sale increased $2.9 million during 2023, due to an increase in the average\nyield to 3.97% from 2.76% for the prior year and, to a lesser extent, a $10.1 million increase in the average balance of\ninvestments. Approximately 44% of our investment portfolio was comprised of variable rate securities which repriced during\nthe rising rate environment during 2023.\nInterest income on interest-earning deposits increased $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023\ncompared to the prior year, due to a 378 basis point increase in the average yield to 5.06% for the year ended December 31,\n2023, from 1.28% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and, to a lesser extent, a $14.5 million increase in their average\nbalance.\n55\nThe following table details average balances, cost of funds and the resulting changes in interest expense for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nChange in\nAverage Average Interest\nBalance Cost Balance Cost Expense\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest-bearing demand accounts $ 80,646 1.26 % $ 101,744 0.47 % $ 535\nSavings accounts 20,612 0.03 23,823 0.03 (1)\nMoney market accounts 498,419 2.91 593,984 0.63 10,759\nCertificates of deposit, retail 342,638 3.13 273,197 1.33 7,106\nBrokered deposits 162,195 5.02 41,603 2.62 7,053\nFHLB advances and other borrowings 127,263 2.52 113,890 1.70 1,274\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities $ 1,231,773 3.05 % $ 1,148,241 0.95 % $ 26,726\nInterest expense increased $26.7 million to $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $10.9 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily a result of the increase in average cost of interest-bearing\ndeposits to 3.12% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 0.87% for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily\nattributed to the rising rate environment in 2023.\nInterest expense increased on all deposit categories other than savings during the year ended December 31, 2023\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Increases were $535,000, $10.8 million, $7.1 million and $7.1 million for\ninterest-bearing demand, money market, retail certificates of deposit and brokered deposits, respectively. Interest expense on\ninterest-bearing demand accounts increased, primarily due to average cost increasing to 1.26% in 2023 as compared to 0.47% in\n2022, partially offset by a $21.1 million reduction in average balance. Interest expense on money market accounts increased,\nprimarily due a 228 basis point increase in average cost, partially offset by a $95.6 million decrease in average balance. To\ncompensate for the volume loss in interest-bearing demand and money market accounts, the Bank promoted their retail\ncertificate of deposits and increased the utilization of brokered deposits as an alternative funding source in 2023. As a result,\ninterest expense on both retail certificates of deposit and brokered deposits increased during 2023. Retail certificates of deposit\nhad an average balance of $342.6 million and an average cost of 3.13% in 2023, compared to average balance of $273.2 million\nand average cost of 1.33% in 2022. The average balance of brokered deposits increased $120.6 million to $162.2 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, compared to $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average cost of\nbrokered deposits increased 240 basis points to 5.02% in 2023 from 2.62% in 2022.\nInterest expense on FHLB advances and other borrowings increased $1.3 million in 2023 compared to 2022 due to\ncombination of an 82 basis point increase in the average rate paid on advances and, to a lesser extent, a $13.4 million increase\nin average balance. As a result of the interest rate hikes in 2023, the average cost of these advances increased to 2.52% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, compared to 1.70% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nProvision for Credit Losses. We recorded a recapture of the provision for credit losses for loans of $400,000 for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. This recapture, combined with a $192,000 provision for credit losses on unfunded loan\ncommitments resulted in a net recapture of provision of $208,000 in 2023. We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments -\nCredit Losses (Topic 326), effective January 1, 2023, which resulted in a net of tax charge of $395,000 to retained earnings and\na $500,000 increase in the ACL. This one-time adoption adjustment, combined with the $208,000 recapture of provision,\nresulted in a $79,000 increase in the ACL. The percentage of the ACL to total loans was 1.28% at December 31, 2023,\ncompared to 1.29% at December 31, 2022. The recapture of provision for credit losses for loans in 2023 was due primarily to\ncredit upgrades and payoffs of loans carrying higher credit risk ratings, updates to economic forecasts used for loans and\nunfunded commitments, changes in the loan portfolio balances, mix and characteristics and other factors.\nIn 2022, we recorded a recapture of the provision for loan and lease losses of $400,000. Combining with a $34,000\nrecapture of provision for loan and lease losses on unfunded commitments, a $434,000 net recapture of provision for loan and\nlease losses was reflected in our financial statements. The recapture of provision in 2022 was primarily a result of $14.4 million\nof loans downgraded to substandard, resulting in these loans being removed from the calculation of the general allowance for\n56\nloan and lease losses and instead being individually analyzed for required specific reserve, which indicated no additional\nspecific reserve was needed. Changes in the composition of our loan portfolio, with $90.7 million growth in lower risk one-to-\nfour family residential loans and a decline in higher risk construction/land loans with over $20.0 million of these loans\nconverting to permanent multifamily loans also contributed to the recapture of provision in 2022.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $474,000 to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023\nfrom $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the\ncomponents of noninterest income:\nYear Ended Year Ended $ %\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGain on sale of investments, net $ — $ 27 $ (27) (100.0) %\nBOLI change in cash surrender value 1,081 1,004 77 7.7\nWealth management revenue 253 312 (59) (18.9)\nDeposit related fees 956 936 20 2.1\nLoan related fees 275 919 (644) (70.1)\nOther 208 49 159 324.5\nTotal noninterest income $ 2,773 $ 3,247 $ (474) (14.6) %\nThe largest change to our noninterest income was a $644,000 decrease in loan related fees for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, primarily due to a $495,000 decrease in fees collected on loan prepayments during the year and a $94,000\ndecrease in annual fees earned on business lines of credit (“LOC”) due to the timing difference in the receipt of such fees in the\ncomparable periods.\nWealth management revenue decreased $59,000 in 2023. This decline was primarily attributed to challenges in\nidentifying and hiring a replacement for a wealth advisor in our primary location, a goal that was successfully achieved in late\n2023 with onboarding of a tenured senior wealth advisor. Additionally, our existing investor base skews toward an older\ndemographic with a conservative, low-risk investing profile. The inclination of these clients toward cash and cash equivalents,\nwhich provides attractive returns with nominal commission expenses, has resulted in a slightly reduced revenue impact.\nBOLI income increased $77,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to net increases in cash\nsurrender value of certain policies during the year of 2023.\nOther noninterest income increased $159,000 during 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $139,000\ncombined result of mark-to-market value adjustment and capital distributions from our fintech focused investment. In addition,\nmerchant service fees increased $17,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31,\n2022, primarily due to an increase in business account referrals to our third-party card payment processing vendor.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $41,000, or 0.1% to $35.7 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 from $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The following table provides a detailed analysis\nof the changes in the components of noninterest expense:\nYear Ended Year Ended $ %\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 20,366 $ 21,133 $ (767) (3.6) %\nOccupancy and equipment 4,748 4,776 (28) (0.6)\nProfessional fees 2,288 2,339 (51) (2.2)\nData processing 2,857 2,678 179 6.7\nRegulatory assessments 763 403 360 89.3\nInsurance and bond premiums 468 464 4 0.9\nMarketing 343 303 40 13.2\nOther general and administrative 3,833 3,529 304 8.6\nTotal noninterest expense $ 35,666 $ 35,625 $ 41 0.1 %\n57\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, regulatory assessments increased $360,000 as a result of the FDIC increasing\ndeposit insurance assessment rates by two basis points effective this year. Other general and administrative expense increased\n$304,000 due to a number of factors, including increased state/local taxes, business development efforts and deposit related\nexpenses reflecting implementation of new deposit programs this year. Data processing expense increased $179,000 primarily\ndue to the reclassification of some expenses to data processing from “Other general and administrative”.\nThese increases were partially offset by a $767,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits. The decrease in\nsalaries and employee benefits primarily was due to a $1.4 million decrease in ESOP expense resulting from the remaining\nunallocated shares under the ESOP being fully allocated during 2022, $815,000 decrease in incentive pay, as well as a $59,000\ndecrease in health insurance costs and a $52,000 decrease in expense related to the Pentegra pension plan, partially offset by an\n$804,000 increase in salaries and wages and $737,000 increase in expenses related to the profit-sharing program which replaced\nthe ESOP in 2023. Additional changes within salary and benefits include a $325,000 decrease in commissions which was\nmostly offset by the $306,000 decrease in loan origination direct cost offset due to lower loan originations, and a $178,000\nincrease in 401(k) matching contributions which was offset by a $178,000 increase in compensation expense related to the grant\nof equity awards.\nThe $51,000 decrease in professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year, was\npartially offset by the $40,000 increase in marketing expense, primarily attributed to our 100-year anniversary.\nFederal Income Tax Expense. We recorded a $1.6 million federal income tax provision for 2023, compared to\n$3.2 million for 2022. The decrease in federal income tax provision for 2023 was primarily the result of a $8.6 million decrease\nin pretax net income.\n58\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost\nThe following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as interest income\nfrom average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate\nspreads, net interest margins and the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities.

Our Board of Directors has approved an asset/liability management policy to guide management in\nmaximizing interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity, capital adequacy, interest rate risk, credit risk, and profitability. It is\nthe responsibility of the ALCO to communicate, coordinate and manage our asset/liability position consistent with our business\nplan and Board-approved policies. The ALCO meets quarterly to review various areas including:\n• economic conditions;\n• interest rate outlook;\n• asset/liability mix;\n• interest rate risk sensitivity;\n• current market opportunities to promote specific products;\n• historical financial results;\n• projected financial results; and\n• capital position.\n61\nThe ALCO also reviews current and projected liquidity needs. As part of its procedures, the ALCO regularly reviews\ninterest rate risk by forecasting the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the market value of\nportfolio equity, which is defined as the net present value of an institution’s existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in the market value of portfolio equity that is\nauthorized by the Board of Directors.\nOur Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are\nestablished contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer\nmaturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by\nchanges in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest\nrates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk.\nTo effectively manage interest rate risk, we have implemented the following strategies:\n• we prioritize originating loans with shorter terms and higher yields whenever feasible. This approach helps to\nmitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations.;\n• we aim to increase the balances of non-maturity deposits with less rate sensitivity. This strategy provides stability\nand flexibility in managing interest rate risk.\n• our investment portfolio includes securities with relatively short average lives, typically less than eight years. This\nensures that the portfolio is responsive to changing interest rate conditions.\n• we added $20.3 million of adjustable-rate loans into our loan portfolio. This diversification helps in adapting to\nchanges in interest rates and managing overall risk.\n• as a funding source, we may employ brokered certificates of deposit with a call option. This strategy provides\nflexibility in managing funding costs while incorporating an option to adjust based on market conditions; and\n• we have employed interest rate swaps to effectively fix the rate on $115.0 million of FHLB advances. This use of\nswaps helps us secure favorable interest rates on specific funding sources, contributing to interest rate risk\nmanagement.\nHow We Measure the Risk of Interest Rate Changes. We monitor our interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis\nby measuring the impact of changes to net interest income in multiple rate environments. Management retains the services of a\nthird-party consultant with over 30 years of experience in asset-liability management to assist in its interest rate risk and asset-\nliability management. Management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest\nrates. Although management believes these assumptions are reasonable, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities\non net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or\nactual results differ from these assumptions. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of\nrepricing, they may react differently to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and\nliabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities\nlag behind changes in market interest rates. Non-uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various\nmaturities will also affect the results presented. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features\nwhich restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, a portion of our adjustable-\nrate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan’s contractual interest rate may not adjust. Approximately 63.5% of our\nloans were adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2023. At that date, $410.8 million, or 54.3%, of these loans with a weighted-\naverage interest rate of 4.75% were at their floor interest rate. A portion of these loans are set to reprice at defined time\nintervals. Adjustable rate loans that are based on prime rate plus a specified margin recalculate each time the prime rate\nchanges. When the floor rate is above a prime rate based loan’s fully indexed rate, the Bank will not receive the benefit of an\nincrease in market rates until the prime rate increases enough where the fully indexed rate exceeds the loans floor rate. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the Bank’s net loans receivable included $128.9 million of prime based loans, all of which were priced\nabove their floors at that date.\nThe inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates.\nHowever, when loans are at their floors, there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of\nfunds during periods of increasing interest rates. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and\nearly withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt\nmay decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all these factors in monitoring our interest rate exposure.\nThe assumptions we use are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and\ncurrent market conditions. These assumptions relate to interest rates, prepayments, deposit decay rates and the market value of\ncertain assets under the various interest rate scenarios. We use market data to determine prepayments and maturities of loans,\n62\ninvestments and borrowings and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits. Time deposits are\nmodeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities. We also assume that non-maturity deposits can be maintained\nwith rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates, based upon our historical deposit decay\nrates, which are substantially lower than market decay rates. We have observed in the past that our deposit accounts during\nchanging rate environments have relatively lower volatility and less than market rate changes. When interest rates rise, we do\nnot have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits. These assumptions are\nbased upon our analysis of our customer base, competitive factors, and historical experience.\nOur income simulation model examines changes in net interest income in scenarios where interest rates were assumed\nto remain at their base level, and instantaneously increase and decrease by 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points.\nThe following table illustrates the estimated change in our net interest income over the next 12 months from\nDecember 31, 2023, that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities, with no\neffect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement. Net interest income would\ndecline in year one under all four rising rate scenarios, with the larger the increase in the interest rate, the larger decline in net\ninterest income.\nInterest Rate Simulation Impact on Net Interest Income\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023\nNet Interest\nBasis Point Change in Rates Income % Change\n(Dollars in thousands)\n+400 $ 35,094 (11.26) %\n+300 36,203 (8.46)\n+200 37,275 (5.75)\n+100 38,477 (2.71)\nBase 39,547 —\n(100) 40,391 2.13\n(200) 42,593 7.70\n(300) 41,606 5.21\n(400) 41,874 5.88\nThe net interest income table presented above is predicated upon a stable balance sheet with no growth or change in\nasset or liability mix. The effects of changes in interest rates are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and\nliabilities and assuming that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates, although there can be no\nassurance that this will be the case. Delinquency rates may change when interest rates change as a result of changes in the loan\nportfolio mix, underwriting conditions, loan terms or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed effect on the\nportfolio. Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would\nperform as assumed. Also, a change in U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of\nthe Treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net interest income other than those indicated above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound\noperation. We maintain cash flows above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal\noperations, including potential deposit outflows. On a daily basis, we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that\nadequate liquidity is maintained.\nOur primary sources of funds are customer deposits, scheduled loan and investment repayments, including interest\npayments, maturing loans and investment securities, and advances from the FHLB. These funds, together with equity, are used\nto fund loans, acquire investments and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and the scheduled\namortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the\nlevel of interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We believe that our current liquidity position, and our forecasted\noperating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments.\n63\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally\ninvested in short-term investments such as overnight deposits or agency or mortgage-backed securities. On a longer term basis,\nwe maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under Item 1. “Business – Lending\nActivities.” At December 31, 2023, the undisbursed portion of construction LIP totaled $44.6 million and unused lines of credit\nwere $39.1 million. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, to pay maturing certificates of\ndeposit and withdrawals on other deposit accounts, to fund loan commitments, and to maintain our portfolio of investments.\nRetail certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at December 31, 2023,\ntotaled $257.0 million and $73.2 million, respectively. Management’s policy is to maintain deposit rates at levels that are\ncompetitive with other local financial institutions. Based on historical experience, we believe that a significant portion of\nmaturing certificates of deposit will remain with the Bank. In addition, we had the ability at December 31, 2023 to borrow an\nadditional $326.3 million from the FHLB, based on our collateral capacity, $55.8 million from the FRB, and $75.0 million from\nunused lines of credit with other financial institutions to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes. See the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this report for further details on our cash flow activities.\nWe measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund our assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due.\nLiquidity (and funding) risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices, or in a reasonable time frame, to meet our\nnormal or unanticipated obligations. We regularly monitor the mix between our assets and our liabilities to manage our liquidity\nand funding requirements.\nOur primary source of funds is our retail deposits. When retail deposits are not sufficient to provide the funds for our\nassets, or if other sources are available with more favorable rates or structure, we use alternative funding sources. These sources\ninclude, but are not limited to, advances from the FHLB, wholesale funding, brokered deposits, federal funds purchased, and\ndealer repurchase agreements, as well as other short-term alternatives. We may also liquidate assets, including but not limited\nto, selling investments at a loss, which could adversely impact our earnings and capital levels. During 2023, to supplement the\ndecline in retail deposits resulting from the rising rate environment, we increased the utilization of brokered deposits as a\nfunding source. We may continue to utilize this type of funding to manage our liquidity position if desirable growth in retail\ndeposits is not expected.\nOn a monthly basis, we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the next twelve months. Also, we determine\nfunding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits. This information is used by our ALCO in\nforecasting funding needs and investing opportunities.\nWe incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to expand and improve our product offerings, enhance and\nmodernize our technology infrastructure, and to introduce new technology-based products to compete effectively in our\nmarkets. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as\nforecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on\ninvestment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, current and projected demand for our\nservices and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory\nconsiderations.\nBased on our current capital allocation objectives, during fiscal 2024 we expect cash expenditures of $759,000 for\ncapital investment in property, plant and equipment. In addition, we currently expect to continue our current practice of paying\nquarterly cash dividends on our common stock subject to our Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice\nat any time and for any reason without prior notice. Our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.13 per share, which\nwe believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing and investing in the\nBank, and returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during 2024 at this rate\nof $0.13 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately $1.2 million, based on the number of\nour current outstanding shares at December 31, 2023.\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, we project that our fixed commitments will include (i) $845,000 of\noperating lease payments and (ii) other future obligations and accrued expenses of $21.5 million. At December 31, 2023, our\n$125.0 million in FHLB borrowings are all short-term and $115.0 million of our advances are tied to interest rate swap\nagreements and are expected to be renewed as they mature during 2024. We believe that our liquid assets combined with the\navailable lines of credit provide adequate liquidity to meet our current financial obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nOur total stockholders’ equity was $161.7 million at December 31, 2023. Consistent with our goal to operate a sound\nand profitable financial organization we will actively seek to maintain the Bank as a “well capitalized” institution in accordance\nwith regulatory standards. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory capital\n64\nratios for the Bank were as follows as of December 31, 2023: Total capital to risk-weighted assets was 16.15%; Tier 1 capital\nand Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 14.90%; and Tier 1 capital to total assets was 10.18%. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the Bank met the financial ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the regulatory guidelines. See\nItem 1. “Business – How We Are Regulated – Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank – Capital\nRequirements.”\nThe Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) component of capital includes a variety of items, including\nthe value of our available-for-sale investment portfolio and the value of our derivative instruments, net of tax. We model\nvarious interest rate scenarios that could impact these elements of AOCI and believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand\nthe estimated potential fluctuations in a variety of interest rate environments.\nFirst Financial Northwest is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to\nits own operating expenses, First Financial Northwest is responsible for paying for any stock repurchases, dividends declared to\nits stockholders and other general corporate expenses. Since First Financial Northwest is a holding company and does not\nconduct operations, its primary sources of liquidity are interest earned on interest-earning assets, principally interest-earning\ndeposits, dividends up streamed from the Bank and borrowings from outside sources. Banking regulations may limit the amount\nof dividends that may be paid to First Financial Northwest by the Bank. See, Item 8. \"Note 14: Regulatory Capital\nRequirements\" in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and Item 1. “Business – How We Are Regulated\n– Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank – Dividends” in this Form 10-K. At December 31, 2023, First\nFinancial Northwest, on an unconsolidated basis, had $8.8 million in cash, noninterest-bearing deposits and liquid investments\ngenerally available for its cash needs.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nItem 7A.

In\nour opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nconsolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the\nconsolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of\naccounting for credit losses effective January 1, 2023, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards\nCodification Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326). The Company adopted the\nnew credit loss standard using the modified retrospective approach such that prior period amounts\nare not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable generally\naccepted accounting principles. The new credit loss standard is also communicated as a critical audit\nmatter below.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on\nour audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require\nthat we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is\nnot required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audit we are required to\nobtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nin accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n66\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to\nwhich they relate.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for\ncredit losses for loans was $15.3 million at December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses is an\nestimate of the expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost using the\nrelevant information about the past events, including historical credit loss experience on loans with\nsimilar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect\nthe collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets. It is\nbased upon the Company’s analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio. These\nfactors include, among others, current economic forecasts, projected payment estimates, changes in\nthe nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, and certain other factors that may\naffect the borrowers’ ability to pay.\nWe identified management’s estimation and application of qualitative factors and current economic\nforecasts, both of which are used in the calculation of the allowance for credit losses on loans, as a\ncritical audit matter. To estimate the allowance for credit losses, the Company determines the life of\nloan loss rates and analyzes qualitative factors that assess the current loan portfolio conditions and\nthe economic environment. The qualitative factors adjust the expected loss rates for current and\nforecasted conditions that may not be fully provided for in the historical loss information. The\nCompany has established a methodology for adjusting the previously determined expected loss rates\nbased on current economic forecasts. The qualitative factor methodology is based on a blend of\nquantitative analysis and management judgement. Auditing management’s judgments regarding the\nqualitative factors and current economic forecasts applied to the allowance for credit losses involved\na high degree of subjectivity.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n Testing the appropriateness of the methodology used in the calculation of the allowance for credit\nlosses, as well as testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation,\napplication of the qualitative factors and current economic forecasts determined by management\nand used in the calculation, and verifying calculations in the allowance for credit losses.\n Obtaining management’s analysis and supporting documentation related to the qualitative factors\nand testing whether the qualitative factors used in the calculation of the allowance for credit\nlosses are supported by the documentation provided by management.\n67\n Obtaining management’s analysis and supporting documentation related to the current economic\nforecasts, and testing whether the forecasts used in the calculation of the allowance for credit\nlosses are reasonable and supportable based on the analysis provided by management.\nEverett, Washington\nMarch 13, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.\n68\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation\nFirst Financial Northwest, Inc. (“First Financial Northwest”), a Washington corporation, was formed on June 1, 2007\nfor the purpose of becoming the holding company for First Financial Northwest Bank (the “Bank”) in connection with the\nconversion from a mutual holding company structure to a stock holding company structure completed on October 9, 2007. First\nFinancial Northwest’s business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in\nthe Bank. Accordingly, the information presented in the consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to\nthe Bank. First Financial Northwest converted from a savings and loan holding company to a bank holding company in 2015\nand is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve of the Federal Reserve System ((the “Federal\nReserve Board” or “Federal Reserve”) through the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the “FRB”). The Bank is regulated\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (the\n“DFI”).\nThe Bank was organized in 1923 as a Washington state-chartered savings and loan association, converted to a federal\nmutual savings and loan association in 1935, and converted to a Washington state-chartered mutual savings bank in 1992. In\n2002, the Bank reorganized into a two-tier mutual holding company structure, became a stock savings bank and became the\nwholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial of Renton, Inc. In connection with the mutual to stock conversion in 2007, the Bank\nchanged its name to First Savings Bank Northwest. In August 2015, the Bank changed its name to First Financial Northwest\nBank to support the expansion of focus to being more than a traditional “savings” bank. In February 2016, the Bank changed its\ncharter from a Washington chartered stock savings bank to a Washington chartered commercial bank.\nThe Bank is a community-based commercial bank primarily serving King and Snohomish Counties, and to a lesser\nextent, Pierce and Kitsap Counties, Washington. In King County, the headquarters and full-service banking office, as well as\none branch office, are located in Renton. Additional King County branch offices are located in Bellevue, Woodinville, Bothell,\nKent, Kirkland and Issaquah. In Snohomish County, five branch offices serve Mill Creek, Edmonds, Clearview, Smokey Point,\nand Lake Stevens. In Pierce County, two branch offices serve Gig Harbor and University Place. The Bank’s business consists of\nattracting deposits from the public and utilizing these deposits to originate one-to-four family residential, multifamily,\ncommercial real estate, construction/land, business and consumer loans.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Financial Northwest and its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries First Financial Northwest Bank and First Financial Diversified Corporation (collectively, “the\nCompany”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions between First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation.\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions based on\navailable information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the\ndisclosures provided. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Material estimates particularly subject to change include\nthe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”).\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 10, 2024, the Bank entered into a definitive agreement in which Global Credit Union will acquire the\nBank. The transaction is structured as a purchase and assumption agreement with Global purchasing substantially all assets and\nassuming substantially all liabilities of the Bank for the all-cash consideration of $231.2 million, subject to certain adjustments,\nand subject to receiving all regulatory approvals, approval by the shareholders of the Company, and other customary closing\nconditions.\nOn February 12, 2024, the Company declared a quarterly dividend to common shareholders of $0.13 per share, to be\npaid on March 28, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024.\n75\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and in banks, interest-bearing\ndeposits and federal funds sold all with maturities of three months or less.\nThe Company is required to maintain an average reserve balance with the FRB or maintain such reserve balance in the\nform of cash. Effective March 26, 2020 the Federal Reserve lowered the reserve ratios on transaction accounts maintained at a\ndepository institution to zero percent. There was no required reserve balance at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInvestments\nInvestments in debt securities are classified into one of three categories: (1) held-to-maturity, (2) available-for-sale, or\n(3) trading. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had held-to-maturity and available-for-sale, but no trading securities.\nInvestments are categorized as held-to-maturity when we have the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity.\nHeld-to-maturity investments are reported at amortized cost.\nInvestments are classified as available-for-sale if the Company intends to hold the securities for an indefinite period of\ntime, but not necessarily to maturity. Investments available-for-sale are reported at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and\nlosses on investments available-for-sale are excluded from earnings and are reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net\nof applicable taxes. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification\nmethod. Amortization or accretion of purchase premiums and discounts are included in investment income using the level-yield\nmethod over the remaining period to contractual maturity. Dividend or interest income is recognized when it is earned.\nThe estimated fair value of investments is based on quoted market prices for investments traded in active markets or\ndealer quotes. Mortgage-backed investments represent participation interest in pools of first mortgage loans originated and\nserviced by the issuers of the investments.\nManagement makes an assessment to determine whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to\nindicate that a security has incurred a credit-related loss. Management considers many factors including recent events specific\nto the issuer or industry, and for debt securities, external credit ratings and recent downgrades. For debt securities, if\nmanagement intends to sell the security or it is likely that management will be required to sell the security before recovering its\ncost basis, the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings. If management does not intend to sell the security and it\nis not likely that management will be required to sell the security but management does not expect to recover the entire\namortized cost basis of the security, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in\nearnings. The credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of\nthe cash flows expected to be collected, limited to the amount that the security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis.\nThe remaining impairment related to all other factors, the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be\ncollected and fair value, is recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Impairment losses related to all\nother factors are presented as separate categories within OCI.\nLoans Receivable\nLoans are recorded at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for charge-offs, the ACL, net deferred fees or costs,\npremium and discounts. Interest on loans is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct\norigination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments.\nThe accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well\nsecured and in the process of collection. Consumer and other loans are typically managed in the same manner. In all cases,\nloans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not collected on loans that are placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Loans\nare returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments\nare reasonably assured. In order to return a nonaccrual loan to accrual status, each loan is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. We\nevaluate the borrower’s financial condition to ensure that future loan payments are reasonably assured. We also take into\n76\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nconsideration the borrower’s willingness and ability to make the loan payments and historical repayment performance. We\nrequire the borrower to make the loan payments consistently for a period of at least six months as agreed to under the terms of\nany modified loan agreement before we will consider reclassifying the loan to accrual status.\nIndividually Evaluated Loans\nThe Company evaluates loans collectively for purposes of determining the ACL in accordance with ASC 326.\nCollective evaluation is based on aggregating loans deemed to possess similar risk characteristics. In certain instances, the\nCompany may identify loans that it believes no longer possess risk characteristics similar to other loans in the portfolio. These\nloans are typically identified from a substandard or worse internal risk grade, since the specific attributes and risks associated\nwith such loans tend to become unique as the credit deteriorates. Such loans are typically nonperforming, modified loans made\nto borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and/or are deemed collateral dependent, where the ultimate repayment of the\nloan is expected to come from the operation of or eventual sale of the collateral.\nLoans that are deemed by management to possess unique risk characteristics are evaluated individually for purposes of\ndetermining an appropriate lifetime ACL. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach, using the loan’s effective\ninterest rate, for determining the ACL on individually evaluated loans, unless the loan is deemed collateral dependent.\nCollateral dependent loans are evaluated based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to\nsell. The Company may increase or decrease the ACL for collateral dependent individually evaluated loans based on changes in\nthe estimated expected fair value of the collateral. In cases where the loan is well-secured and the estimated value of the\ncollateral exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, no ACL is recorded. Changes in the ACL for all other individually evaluated\nloans is substantially on the Company’s evaluation of cash flows expected to be received from such loans.\nLoan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nLoan modifications are made in the ordinary course of business and are completed on a case-by-case basis through\nnegotiation with the borrower in connection with the ongoing loan collection processes. Loan modifications are made to\nprovide borrowers payment relief and typically include adjustments such as changes to interest rate, advancement of maturity\ndate, and interest only payments for a period of time. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, which\neliminated accounting guidance for troubled-debt restructurings while requiring disclosure of borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty for modifications related to principal reductions, interest rate reductions, term extensions, and more than insignificant\npayment delay.\nFrom time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases,\nthese modifications may result in new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the\nform of a principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension or a\ncombination thereof, among other things.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had no loans that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified\nduring the year.\n77\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAllowance for Credit Losses (AFS Investments)\nFor AFS securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more\nlikely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the\nsecurity’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS securities where neither of the criteria are\nmet, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this\nassessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the credit rating of\nthe security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this\nassessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are\ncompared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the\namortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited to the amount\nthat the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any remaining discount that has not been recorded through an allowance\nfor credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a\nprovision (or recaputure) for credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the\nuncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. As\nof December 31, 2023, the Company determined that the unrealized loss positions in AFS securities were not the result of credit\nlosses, and therefore, an allowance for credit losses was not recorded.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (HTM Investments)\nThe three annuities we own and classify as held to maturity were purchased to support payments to two executive as\npart of their Supplemental Employment Retirement Program (“SERP”). These annuities, along with an associated policy and\nrider, provide for payments in retirement for the life of the executive. The rider that provides the long term guarantee for the\nSERP has no cash value and is not transferable to another annuitant. The cash value of the annuity is representative of the\nliquidation value of the contract. For this reason, no allowance for credit losses was recorded.\nAllowance for Credit Losses (Loans and Unfunded Commitments)\nThe Company maintains an ACL for the expected credit losses of the loan portfolio as well as unfunded loan\ncommitments. The amount of ACL is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments by management. The CECL methodology\nrequires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures).\nThe ACL for the loan portfolio is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans amortized cost basis to present\nthe net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loan balances are charged off against the ACL when management\nbelieves the non-collectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Recoveries are recorded as an increase to the ACL for loans to\nthe extent they do not exceed the related charge-off amounts. The ACL for loans, as reported in our consolidated balance sheets,\nis adjusted by a provision for credit losses and reduced by the charge-offs of loan amounts, net of recoveries.\nThe ACL consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The estimate of\nexpected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is\ngenerally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider whether the historical loss experience should\nbe adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period that\nhistorical experience was based for each loan type. Finally, we consider forecasts about future economic conditions or changes\nin collateral values that are reasonable and supportable.\nManagement estimates the ACL balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources\nrelating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides\nthe basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in\ncurrent loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix or delinquency levels or\nother relevant factors.\nThe credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of its loan\nportfolio, disaggregating loans into pools, the level at which credit risk is monitored. Determining the appropriateness of the\nACL is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future\n78\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nperiods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, based on the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in material\nchanges in the ACL and provision for credit losses.\nThe methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses has two basic components: first, a pooled\ncomponent for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics and second an asset-\nspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of\nexpected credit losses for such individual loans. The Company's ACL model methodology is to build a reserve rate using\nhistorical life of loan default rates combined with assessments of current loan portfolio information and current and forecasted\neconomic environment and business cycle information. The model uses statistical analysis to determine the life of loan default\nrates for the quantitative component and analyzes qualitative factors (Q-Factors) that assess the current loan portfolio conditions\nand forecasted economic environment and collateral values.\nManagement maintains an ACL for unfunded commitments to absorb estimated expected credit losses associated with\nour off-balance commitments to lend funds such as unused lines of credit and the undisbursed portion of construction loans.\nThe estimate considers the likelihood that funding will occur and estimated expected credit losses on commitments expected to\nbe funded over the estimated life. Loss rates are estimated by utilizing the same loss rates calculated for the allowance for credit\nlosses related to the respective loan portfolio pool. The ACL for unfunded commitments is based on estimates and ultimate\nlosses may vary from the current estimates. The ACL on unfunded commitments is evaluated on a regular basis an necessary\nadjustments are recorded as a provision (recapture of provision) for credit losses. The ACL for unfunded commitments is\nincluded in the other liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful\nlives used to compute depreciation and amortization is 15 to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, and is three to\nseven years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease.\nManagement reviews buildings, improvements and equipment for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or\nchanges in the circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows for the property are less than its carrying value. If\nidentified, an impairment loss is recognized through a charge to earnings based on the fair value of the property.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock\nAs a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Company is required to maintain a minimum level of\ninvestment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (“FHLB”) stock, based on specified percentages of total assets and\nthe Bank’s outstanding FHLB advances. Ownership of FHLB stock is restricted to the FHLB and member institutions. The\nCompany’s investment in FHLB stock is carried at par value ($100 per share), which reasonably approximates its fair value.\nTransfer of Financial Assets\nTransfers of an entire financial asset, a group of entire financial assets, or participating interest in an entire financial\nasset are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to\nbe surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions\nthat constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not\nmaintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOREO consists principally of properties acquired through foreclosure and is originally stated at estimated market value\nless selling costs. Losses arising from the acquisition of property, in full or partial satisfaction of loans, are charged to the ACL.\nSubsequent to the transfer of foreclosed assets held for sale, the assets are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value\n(less estimated costs to sell), based on periodic evaluations. Subsequent write-downs in value are charged to noninterest\nexpense. Generally, legal and professional fees associated with foreclosures are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to improve\nproperty prior to sale are capitalized; however, in no event are recorded costs allowed to exceed estimated fair value.\n79\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSubsequent gains, losses, or expenses recognized on the sale of these properties are included in noninterest expense. The\namounts that will ultimately be recovered from foreclosed assets may differ substantially from the carrying value of the assets\nbecause of future market factors beyond management’s control.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company has purchased life insurance on certain key executives and officers. Bank-owned life insurance\n(“BOLI”) is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash\nsurrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement. Increases to the cash surrender\nvalue are recorded as noninterest income and partially offset expenses for employee benefits. Certain BOLI contracts contain\nendorsement split-dollar life agreements. In these circumstances, the Bank accrues a reserve liability and related compensation\nexpense for the expected future benefit payout.\nLoan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as unused lines of credit and commercial\nletters of credit issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount of these items represents the exposure to loss before\nconsidering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation cost is recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards, based on the fair value of these awards\nat the grant date. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the\nCompany’s common stock at the grant date is used for restricted stock awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the\nrequired service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.\nFederal Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return and records its provision for income taxes under the asset\nand liability method. Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of certain income and expense\namounts between the Company’s financial statements and its tax return. The principal items giving rise to these differences\ninclude net operating losses, valuation adjustments on foreclosed properties, and allowance for credit losses. Deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or\nliabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nadjusted through the provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances are established to reduce the net carrying amount of\ndeferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some portion of the potential deferred tax asset will\nnot be realized. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with income tax matters in income tax\nexpense.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\nThe cost of shares issued to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”), but not yet allocated to participants, is\nshown as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. Compensation expense is based on the market price of shares as they are\ncommitted to be released to participant accounts. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares reduce retained earnings; dividends on\nunearned ESOP shares reduce debt and accrued interest. As of December 31, 2022, all shares under the ESOP were allocated.\nEarnings Per Share\nNonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are\nparticipating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share (“EPS”) pursuant to the two-class method. The\ntwo-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating\nsecurity according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Certain shares of the\nCompany’s nonvested restricted stock awards qualify as participating securities.\n80\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNet income is allocated between the common stock and participating securities pursuant to the two-class method,\nbased on their rights to receive dividends, participate in earnings or absorb losses. Basic earnings per common share is\ncomputed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period, excluding participating nonvested restricted shares. As ESOP shares are committed to be\nreleased, they are included in the outstanding shares used in the basic EPS calculation.\nDiluted earnings per share is computed in a similar manner, except that first the denominator is increased to include\nthe number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares, excluding the participating\nsecurities, were issued using the treasury stock method. For all periods presented, stock options and certain restricted stock\nawards are potentially dilutive non-participating instruments issued by the Company.\nUndistributed losses are not allocated to the nonvested share-based payment awards (the participating securities) under\nthe two-class method as the holders are not contractually obligated to share in the losses of the Company.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of net income and unrealized gains and losses on investments available-for-sale and\nderivatives, which are also recognized as separate components of equity, net of tax.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising costs are generally expensed as incurred and are not material.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more\nfully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding\ninterest rates, credit risk, prepayments and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items.\nChanges in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.\nSegment Information\nThe Company’s activities are considered to be a single industry segment for financial reporting purposes. The\nCompany is engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and providing lending services. Substantially\nall income is derived from a diverse base of investments and commercial, construction, mortgage, and consumer lending\nactivities.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current consolidated\nfinancial statement presentation. The results of the reclassifications are not considered material and have no effect on previously\nreported net income or stockholders’ equity.\nDerivatives\nThe Company designates certain interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge, and as such, reports the net fair\nvalue as an asset or liability. The hedge is utilized to mitigate the risk of variability in future interest payments. The fair value of\nthe cash flow hedge is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for\nwhich the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. The derivative is marked to\nits fair value, with the change in fair value recorded as other comprehensive income or loss. Each derivative is tested for\neffectiveness quarterly and all of our derivatives continue to be deemed effective. The gain or loss on the derivative is\nreclassified into earnings in the same income statement line item that is used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n81\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded from a business combination as the difference in purchase price and fair value of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, and as such, is not amortized. The Company performs a\ngoodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis as of December 31. Additionally, the Company performs an impairment\nanalysis as needed when circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists. Any impairment will be recorded as a noninterest\nexpense and corresponding reduction in intangible asset on the consolidated financial statements.\nCore Deposit Intangible\nA core deposit intangible (“CDI”) asset was recognized from the assumption of core deposit liabilities in connection\nwith the acquisition of four banking branches from a third party in 2017 (the “Branch Acquisition”). The asset was valued by a\nthird party and is amortized into noninterest expense over ten years. The CDI is evaluated for impairment annually with any\nadditional decline recorded as a noninterest expense on the Consolidated Income Statement.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) as amended\nby ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05, was originally issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\n(“FASB”) in June 2016. This ASU replaces the incurred loss methodology which delays recognition until it is probable a loss\nhas been incurred with an expected loss methodology referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) methodology.\nThe amendments in this ASU require a financial asset that is measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount\nexpected to be collected. The income statement would then reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized\nfinancial assets as well as changes to the expected credit losses that have taken place during the reporting period. The\nmeasurement of expected credit losses under CECL will be based on historical information, current conditions, and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts that impact the collectability of the reported amount. Available-for-sale securities will bifurcate the\nfair value mark and establish an allowance for credit losses through the income statement for the credit portion of that mark.\nThe interest portion will continue to be recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The change in\nACL recognized as a result of the adoption of CECL will occur through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as\nof the beginning of the first reporting period in which the ASU is adopted. This ASU was effective for smaller reporting\ncompanies, such as the Company, on January 1, 2023. ASU 2019-05 issued in April 2019 further provides that entities that have\ncertain financial instruments measured at amortized cost that have credit losses, to irrevocably elect the fair value option in\nSubtopic 825-10, upon adoption of Topic 326. The fair value option applies to available-for-sale debt securities. This ASU was\neffective upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, and should be applied on a modified-retrospective basis as a cumulative-effect\nadjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the statement of financial condition as of the adoption date. On\nJanuary 1, 2023, the Company adopted this ASU, which resulted in a net of tax charge of $395,000 to retained earnings, and a\n$500,000 increase to ACL for the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance. The impact that the transition to CECL had on\nthe expected credit losses on unfunded commitments was deemed to be immaterial.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). This ASU applies to\ncontracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) or other rate\nreferences expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are elective and apply to\nall entities that have derivative instruments that use an interest rate that will be modified by reference rate reform. This ASU\nprovides implementation guidance to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 may be applied to\nderivative instruments. This ASU may be elected on a full retrospective basis for any interim period subsequent to March 12,\n2020, or on a prospective basis to new modifications from any date subsequent to the date of issuance. Effective January 25,\n2021, the Company adhered to the Interbank Offered Rate Fallbacks Protocol (“Protocol”) as published by the International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. and recommended by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee. Additionally,\neffective January 1, 2022, the Company was no longer initiating or renewing loans using LIBOR as an index. As of December\n31, 2023, all of the Company’s contracts using LIBOR have been converted to be based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(“SOFR”).\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructured loans\n82\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(“TDRs”) by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors\nwhen a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, the ASU requires public business entities to disclose current-\nperiod gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. This ASU is effective\nupon adoption of ASU 2016-13. On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted this ASU at the same time ASU 2016-13 was\nadopted. The Company had no loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company had $22,000 gross charge-offs in consumer loans since the adoption of this ASU.\nNote 2 -Investments\nThe following tables summarize the amortized cost and fair value of investments available-for-sale at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the corresponding amounts of gross unrealized gains and losses.\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nMortgage-backed investments:\nFannie Mae $ 11,562 $ — $ (1,684) $ 9,878\nFreddie Mac 12,934 — (1,755) 11,179\nGinnie Mae 28,096 — (1,516) 26,580\nOther 30,559 — (1,366) 29,193\nMunicipal bonds 36,571 42 (4,764) 31,849\nU.S. Government agencies 71,003 5 (1,051) 69,957\nCorporate bonds 33,000 — (3,721) 29,279\n$ 223,725 $ 47 $ (15,857) $ 207,915\nDecember 31, 2022\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nMortgage-backed investments:\nFannie Mae $ 11,800 $ — $ (1,860) $ 9,940\nFreddie Mac 13,720 — (1,831) 11,889\nGinnie Mae 29,426 18 (1,601) 27,843\nOther 34,295 — (1,906) 32,389\nMunicipal bonds 36,968 17 (6,102) 30,883\nU.S. Government agencies 76,718 6 (2,370) 74,354\nCorporate bonds 33,000 — (2,520) 30,480\n$ 235,927 $ 41 $ (18,190) $ 217,778\nThere were $2.5 million and $2.4 million of investments classified as held-to-maturity at December 31, 2023, and\n2022, respectively. In January 2020, the Company purchased three annuity contracts to be held long-term to satisfy the benefit\nobligation associated with certain supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) agreements. These annuities, along with an\nassociated insurance policy and rider, provide for payments in retirement for the life of the executive. The rider that provides\nthe long term guarantee for the SERP has no cash value and is not transferrable to another annuitant. The cash value of the\nannuity is representative of the liquidation value of the contract. Hence, the amortized cost of each of these HTM investments is\nconsidered to be its fair value.\n83\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC.

The declines in fair market values of these securities were mainly attributed to changes in market\ninterest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Currently, the Company does not intend to sell, and it is\nnot more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the positions before their recovery of the amortized cost\nbasis, which may be at maturity.

The Company assigns a risk rating to all credit exposures based on the risk rating system\ndesigned to define the basic characteristics and identified risk elements of each credit extension. The Company utilizes a\nnine-pointriskratingsystem.Adescriptionofthegeneralcharacteristicsoftheriskgradesisasfollows:\n• Grades 1 through 5: These grades are considered to be “pass” credits. These include assets where there is virtually no\ncredit risk, such as cash secured loans with funds on deposit with the Company. Pass credits also include credits that\nare on the Company’s watch list (grade 5), where the borrower exhibits potential weaknesses, which may, if not\nchecked or corrected, negatively affect the borrower’s financial capacity and threaten their ability to fulfill debt\nobligations in the future.\n• Grade 6: These credits, classified as ”special mention”, possess weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention.\nSpecial mention assets do not expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification in the\n87\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsubstandard, doubtful or loss categories. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration in\nthe Company’s credit position at a future date.\n• Grade 7: These credits, classified as “substandard”, present a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some\nloss if the deficiencies are not corrected. These credits have well defined weaknesses which jeopardize the orderly\nliquidation of the debt and are inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the borrower or\nof any collateral pledged.\n• Grade 8: These credits are classified as “doubtful” have well defined weaknesses which make the full collection or\nliquidation of the loan highly questionable and improbable.

Fair values of assets or liabilities are based on estimates of the exit price, which is the price that would be\nreceived to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. When available, observable market transactions or market information is\nused. The fair value estimate of loans receivable was based on similar techniques, with the addition of current origination\nspreads, liquidity premiums, or credit adjustments. The fair value of nonperforming loans is based on the underlying value of\nthe collateral.\nThe Company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy which requires\nan entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair values.\nObservable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect its estimate for\nmarket assumptions.\nValuation inputs refer to the assumptions market participants would use in pricing a given asset or liability using one\nof the three valuation techniques. Inputs can be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are those assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the particular asset or liability. These inputs are based on market data and are obtained\nfrom an independent source. Unobservable inputs are assumptions based on the Company’s own information or estimate of\nassumptions used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are based on the best and most\ncurrent information available on the measurement date.\nAll inputs, whether observable or unobservable, are ranked in accordance with a prescribed fair value hierarchy:\n• Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n96\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n• Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments\nin markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable.\n• Level 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.\nThe Company used the following methods to measure fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.\n• Investments available-for-sale: The fair value of all investments, excluding FHLB stock, was based upon quoted\nmarket prices for similar investments in active markets, identical or similar investments in markets that are not\nactive, and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable.\n• Collateral dependent loans: The fair value of collateral dependent loans is measured using the present value of\nexpected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. When the sole source of repayment of the\nloan is the operation or liquidation of the collateral, the fair value is determined using the observable market price\nless certain completion costs.\n• Derivatives: The fair value of derivatives is based on pricing models utilizing observable market data and discounted\ncash flow methodologies for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or\nestimation.\n97\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC.

At December 31, 2023, the credit facility was collateralized by $224.7 million of one-to-four\nfamily residential mortgages, $168.7 million of commercial real estate loans, and $57.9 million of multifamily loans under a\nblanket lien arrangement. At December 31, 2022, the credit facility was collateralized by $235.9 million of one-to-four family\nresidential mortgages, $163.8 million of commercial real estate loans, and $62.5 million of multifamily loans under a blanket\nlien arrangement. The Company also had unused line-of-credit facilities of $55.8 million with the FRB and $75.0 million with\nother financial institutions at December 31, 2023, with interest payable at the then stated rate.\nSummary information related to FHLB advances and other borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, consisted of the following:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nMaximum borrowing outstanding at any month end $ 160,000 $ 159,000\nAverage borrowing outstanding during year 127,263 113,890\nBalance outstanding at end of year 125,000 145,000\nAverage rate paid during the year 2.52 % 1.70 %\nWeighted-average rate paid at end of year 2.22 2.37\nScheduled maturities of FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2023, were as follows:\nWeighted Average Interest Rate at\nBalance Due December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFHLB overnight Fed Funds $ 10,000 5.50 %\nFixed rate, maturing within two months 115,000 1.94\n$ 125,000\nNote 10 - Leases\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 842, Leases, recognizing ROU assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2023, the Company had 13 operating leases for retail branch locations. The\nremaining initial lease terms range from five months to 7.1 years, with most leases carrying optional extensions of three to five\nyears. The Company will include optional lease term extensions in the lease ROU assets and lease liabilities when management\n103\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nbelieves it is reasonably certain that the term extension will be exercised, which will be determined based on indicators that the\nCompany would have an economic incentive to extend the lease. Short term leases, having a term of one year or less, are\nexpensed in the period of the lease. To calculate the present value of future lease payments, the Company uses an incremental\nborrowing rate equal to the FHLB advance rate at the time of the lease inception, or at January 1, 2019, for leases in place at\nthat date.\nThe minimum monthly lease payments are generally based on square footage of the leased premises, with escalating\nminimum rent over the lease term. At December 31, 2023, the Company was committed to paying $74,000 per month in\nminimum monthly lease payments. The minimum monthly lease payment over the initial lease term, including any free rent\nperiod, was used to calculate the lease ROU asset and lease liability. The Company’s current leases do not include any non-\nlease components.\nTotal lease expense included in the Company’s consolidated income statement includes the amortized lease expense\nunder ASC Topic 842, Leases, combined with variable lease expenses for maintenance or other expenses as defined in the\nindividual lease agreements. The Company’s consolidated balance sheet includes the lease ROU asset and lease liability.

At December 31, 2023,\nthe hedged items have a total notional amount of $115.0 million, and consist of rolling one-month or three-month FHLB\nadvances that are renewed at the fixed interest rate at each renewal date. The hedging instruments have two to eight year terms,\nwith remaining terms ranging from eight months to 5.8 years, and stipulate that the counterparty will pay the Company interest\nat one-month or three-month SOFR and the Company will pay a weighted-average fixed interest of 1.87% on the notional\namount of $10.0 million to $15.0 million. The Company pays or receives the net interest amount monthly or quarterly based on\n104\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe respective hedge agreement and includes this amount as part of interest expense on borrowings on the Consolidated Income\nStatement.\nQuarterly, the effectiveness evaluation is based upon the fluctuation of the interest the Company pays to the FHLB for\nthe debt as compared to the one-month or three-month SOFR interest received from the counterparty. At December 31, 2023,\nthe $7.6 million net fair value gain of the cash flow hedges was reported with other assets. The tax effected amount of\n$6.0 million was included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. There were no amounts recorded in the Consolidated\nIncome Statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022, related to ineffectiveness.\nFair value for these derivative instruments, which generally changes as a result of changes in the level of market\ninterest rates, is estimated based on dealer quotes and secondary market sources.\nThe following table presents the fair value of derivative instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nBalance Sheet Fair Value at Fair Value at\nLocation December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nInterest rate swaps on FHLB debt designated as cash\nflow hedges Other assets $ 7,565 $ 10,485\nThe following table presents the net unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments, net of tax, included on the\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 Amount of 2022 Amount of\nLoss Recognized In Gain Recognized In\nLocation OCI, net of tax OCI, net of tax\n(In thousands)\nOther\nInterest rate swaps on FHLB debt designated as cash Comprehensive\nflow hedge Income $ 2,307 $ 7,105\nNote 12 - Benefit Plans\nMulti-employer Pension Plans\nThe Company participates in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions (the “Pentegra DB Plan”), a\ntax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan that covers substantially all employees after one year of continuous employment.\nPension benefits vest over a period of five years of credited service. The Pentegra DB Plan’s Employer Identification Number is\n13-5645888 and the Plan Number is 333. The Pentegra DB Plan operates as a multi-employer plan for accounting purposes and\nas a multiple-employer plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code.\nThere are no collective bargaining agreements in place that require contributions to the Pentegra DB Plan.\nThe Pentegra DB Plan is a single plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 413(c) and, as a result, all of the assets\nstand behind all of the liabilities. Accordingly, under the Pentegra DB Plan, contributions made by a participating employer\nmay be used to provide benefits to participants of other participating employers.\nAs of March 31, 2013, the Pentegra DB Plan was frozen, eliminating all future benefit accruals for employees. Each\nemployee’s accrued benefit was determined as of March 31, 2013.\nThe funding target is the present value of all benefits that have accrued as of the first day of the current plan year\n(July 1). Because interest rates used to calculate the present value of all benefits (5.22% for 2023 and 5.39% for 2022) is\nsignificantly higher than current market value investment rates, the funding target does not represent the Company’s actual\nliability upon withdrawal from participation in the Pentegra DB Plan, which is significantly larger than the funding target. The\ntable below presents the funded status (market value of plan assets divided by funding target) of the plan as of July 1:\n105\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC.

The Company recorded $276,000 and $177,000 of compensation expense for the years ended December 31,\n2023, and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023, a $1.2 million liability was included in other liabilities on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet in support of the expected current and future benefit payments on these agreements. In addition, in\nJanuary 2020, the Company purchased three annuity contracts, totaling $2.4 million, to satisfy the benefit obligation associated\nwith certain supplemental executive retirement plan agreements. As of December 31, 2023, these annuities were reported as\ninvestments held-to-maturity with a fair value of $2.5 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, covering substantially all\nemployees after 60 days of continuous employment. Under this Safe Harbor plan, employee contributions up to 5% of\ncompensation are matched 100% by the Company and said matching contributions are immediately vested to the employee.\nEmployees may make investments in various stock, money market, or fixed income plans. The Company contributed $543,000\nand $365,000 to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In an effort to replace the ESOP\nbenefits that matured in 2022, as outlined below, the Company introduced a profit-sharing plan beginning in 2023, wherein a\ncontribution will be made to every employee’s retirement account in an amount ranging from 5% to 8% annually, based on the\nCompany’s profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an accrued expense of $737,000 for\nthe plan to be contributed to employees’ retirement accounts in early 2024.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\nThe Company provides an ESOP for the benefit of substantially all employees. The ESOP borrowed $16.9 million\nfrom First Financial Northwest and used those funds to acquire 1,692,800 shares of First Financial Northwest’s stock at the\ntime of the initial public offering at a price of $10.00 per share. The loan which had a fixed interest rate of 4.88% matured on\nOctober 8, 2022.\nShares purchased by the ESOP with the loan proceeds were held in a suspense account and were allocated to ESOP\nparticipants on a pro rata basis as principal and interest payments were made by the ESOP to First Financial Northwest. The\nloan was secured by First Financial Northwest’s common stock purchased with the loan proceeds and was repaid by the ESOP\nwith funds from the Bank’s discretionary contributions to the ESOP and earnings on the ESOP assets. No payments were made\n106\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\non ESOP loan in 2023 due to the loan’s maturity in October 2022. Principal and interest payments totaled $1.2 million during\n2022.\nAs shares were committed to be released from collateral, the Company reported compensation expense equal to the\ndaily average market prices of the shares and the shares became outstanding for EPS computations. Compensation expense was\naccrued throughout the year.\nA summary of key transactions for the ESOP for the years ended December 31, follows:\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nESOP contribution expense $ — $ 1,372\nDividends on unallocated ESOP shares used to reduce ESOP contribution — 30\nShares held by the ESOP at December 31, 2023 and 2022, are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands, except share data)\nAllocated shares 1,692,800 1,692,800\nUnallocated shares — —\nTotal ESOP shares 1,692,800 1,692,800\nFair value of unallocated shares — —\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn June 2016, First Financial Northwest’s shareholders approved the First Financial Northwest, Inc. 2016 Equity\nIncentive Plan (“2016 Plan”). This plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options (“ISO”), non-qualified stock\noptions (“NQSO”), restricted stock and restricted stock units. The 2016 Plan expires in June 2026. The 2016 Plan established\n1,400,000 shares available to grant with a maximum of 400,000 of these shares available to grant as restricted stock awards.\nEach share issued as a restricted stock award counts as two shares towards the total shares available to be awarded.\nAs a result of the approval of the 2016 Plan, the First Financial Northwest, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (“2008\nPlan”) was frozen with no additional awards being made under the 2008 plan. Restricted stock awards and stock options that\nwere granted under the 2008 Plan are fully vested and unexercised options remain exercisable, subject to the provision of the\n2008 Plan and the respective award agreements. At December 31, 2023, there were 848,598 total shares available for future\ngrant under the 2016 Plan, including 144,299 shares available to be granted as restricted stock.\nUnder the 2016 Plan, the vesting date for each option award or restricted stock award is determined by an award\ncommittee and specified in the award agreement. In the case of restricted stock awards granted in lieu of cash payments of\ndirectors’ fees, the grant date is used as the vesting date.\nTotal compensation expense for the 2016 Plan was $605,000 and $770,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. The related income tax benefit was $127,000 and $162,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nStock Options\nUnder the 2008 Plan, stock option awards were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of First\nFinancial Northwest's common stock at the grant date. At December 31, 2023, options granted under the 2008 Plan to purchase\n122,500 shares were outstanding and fully vested and exercisable. Stock options have a contractual period of ten years. Any\n107\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nunexercised stock options will expire ten years after the grant date, or sooner in the event of the award recipient’s death,\ndisability or termination of service with the Company.\nUnder the 2016 Plan, the exercise price and vesting period for stock options are determined by the award committee\nand specified in the award agreement, however, the exercise price shall not be less than the fair market value of a share as of the\ngrant date. Any unexercised stock options will expire 10 years after the award date or sooner in the event of the award\nrecipient’s death, disability, retirement, or termination of service. On August 4, 2023, 40,000 shares were granted as stock\noptions under the 2016 Plan.\nA cashless exercise of vested stock options may occur by the option holder surrendering the number of options valued\nat the current stock price at the time of exercise to cover the total cost to exercise. The surrendered options are canceled and are\nunavailable for reissue.\nThe fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes model that uses the\nassumptions noted in the table below. The dividend yield is based on the current quarterly dividend in effect at the time of the\ngrant. Historical employment data is used to estimate the forfeiture rate. The historical volatility of the Company’s stock price\nover a specified period of time is used for the expected volatility assumption. First Financial Northwest bases the risk-free\ninterest rate on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity Indices in effect on the date of the grant. First Financial Northwest elected\nto use the “simplified” method permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to calculate the expected term. This\nmethod uses the vesting term of an option along with the contractual term, setting the expected life at the midpoint.\nThe fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions as of the grant\ndate for the periods indicated.

Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those\ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax\nrates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. These calculations are based on many complex\nfactors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal income tax laws, and\na determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could\ndiffer significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no net operating loss carryforward.\nAs a result of the bad debt deductions taken in years prior to 1988, retained earnings includes accumulated earnings of\napproximately $4.5 million, on which federal income taxes have not been provided. If, in the future, this portion of retained\nearnings is used for any purpose other than to absorb losses on loans or on property acquired through foreclosure, federal\nincome taxes may be imposed at the then-prevailing corporate tax rates. The Company does not contemplate that such amounts\nwill be used for any purpose that would create a federal income tax liability; therefore no provision has been made.\nUnder GAAP, a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is “more likely than not” that a portion of the\ndeferred tax asset will not be realized. In order to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed, management\n110\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nevaluates both positive and negative evidence under the “more likely than not” standard. The weight given to the potential\neffect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be\nobjectively verified. As of December 31, 2023, it was determined the full deferred tax asset would be realized in future periods\nand a valuation allowance would not be necessary.\nThe Company had no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2023 or 2022, and recognized no interest or tax\npenalties. The Company has filed U.S. federal income tax returns. Income tax returns filed are subject to examination by the\nU.S. federal, state, and local income tax authorities. While no income tax returns are currently being examined, the Company is\nno longer subject to tax examination by tax authorities for years prior to 2020.\nNote 14 - Regulatory Capital Requirements\nUnder Federal regulations, pre-conversion retained earnings are restricted for the protection of pre-conversion\ndepositors.\nFirst Financial Northwest is a bank holding company under the supervision of the FRB. Bank holding companies are\nsubject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as\namended, and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, except that, pursuant to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief\nand Consumer Protection Act, effective August 30, 2018, a bank holding company with consolidated assets of less than\n$3 billion is generally not subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital regulations, which parallel the FDIC’s capital regulations.\nThe Bank is a federally insured institution and thereby is subject to the capital requirements established by the FDIC. Failure to\nmeet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and, possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators\nthat, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy\nguidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital regulations that\ninvolve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory\naccounting practices. First Financial Northwest was not subject to regulatory requirements for bank holding companies at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, as its assets were less than the $3.0 billion threshold.\nThe capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components,\nrisk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum\namounts and ratios (set forth in the table that follows) of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the\nregulations) and of Tier 1 capital to average assets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, according to the most recent notification from the FDIC, the Bank was categorized as\nwell-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since the\nnotification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.\n111\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2023 and 2022, are presented in the following table.\nTo be Well Capitalized\nFor Capital Adequacy Under Prompt Corrective\nActual Purposes Action Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023:\nTotal risk-based capital $ 171,971 16.15 % $ 85,194 8.00 % $ 106,493 10.00 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital 158,629 14.90 63,896 6.00 85,194 8.00\nCommon equity tier 1\ncapital (“CET1”) 158,629 14.90 47,922 4.50 69,220 6.50\nTier 1 leverage capital 158,629 10.18 62,349 4.00 77,936 5.00\nDecember 31, 2022:\nTotal risk-based capital $ 169,755 15.62 % $ 86,942 8.00 % $ 108,678 10.00 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital 156,147 14.37 65,207 6.00 86,942 8.00\nCommon equity tier 1\ncapital (“CET1”) 156,147 14.37 48,905 4.50 70,641 6.50\nTier 1 leverage capital 156,147 10.31 60,578 4.00 75,722 5.00\nIn addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, total capital and leverage ratios, the Bank must maintain a capital\nconservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required\nminimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary\nbonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. As of December 31, 2023, the\nBank’s capital conservation buffer was 8.15%.\nNote 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk. In the normal course of business, the Company makes loan\ncommitments, typically unfunded loans and unused lines of credit, to accommodate the financial needs of its customers. These\narrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the\nCompany’s normal credit policies, including collateral requirements, where appropriate. Commitments to extend credit are\nagreements to lend to customers in accordance with predetermined contractual provisions. These commitments are for specific\nperiods or, may contain termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee. The total amounts of unused commitments\ndo not necessarily represent future credit exposure or cash requirements, in that commitments can expire without being drawn\nupon. Unfunded commitments to originate loans or extend credit totaled $83.6 million at December 31, 2023, and $74.0 million\nat December 31, 2022.\nLease Commitments. The Company has entered into lease commitments for its branches located in Mill Creek,\nEdmonds, Renton, Bellevue, Woodinville, Smokey Point, Lake Stevens, Bothell, Kent, Kirkland, University Place, Gig Harbor,\nand Issaquah, all in Washington. For more information on the Company’s lease commitments, see Note 10 - Leases.\nLegal Proceedings. The Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time defendants in and are threatened with\nvarious legal proceedings arising from their regular business activities. Management, after consulting with legal counsel, is of\n112\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe opinion that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from these pending or threatened actions and proceedings will not have a\nmaterial effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nEmployment Contracts and Severance Agreements. The Company has change in control severance agreements with\nkey officers that offer specified terms of salary coverage. In addition, the Company has employment contracts with certain\nexecutives that include specified terms of salary coverage as a result of involuntary termination due to change in control or\nother circumstances.\nNote 16 - Parent Company Only Financial Statements\nPresented below are the condensed balance sheets, income statements and statements of cash flows for First Financial\nNorthwest.\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC.\nCondensed Balance Sheets\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 301 $ 223\nInterest-bearing deposits 8,464 9,612\nInvestment in subsidiaries 152,408 150,522\nReceivable from subsidiaries 8 3\nOther assets 686 236\nTotal assets $ 161,867 $ 160,596\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nLiabilities:\nPayable to subsidiaries $ 60 $ 64\nDeferred tax liability, net 9 6\nOther liabilities 138 166\nTotal liabilities 207 236\nStockholders’ equity 161,660 160,360\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 161,867 $ 160,596\n113\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC.

No options to purchase\nshares of common stock were omitted because their effect would be anti-dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNote 18 - Revenue Recognition\nIn accordance with Topic 606, revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to the customer in\nexchange for the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive. To determine the appropriate recognition of\nrevenue for transactions within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the\ncontract(s) with the customer; (ii) identify the separate performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction\nprice; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when\nthe entity satisfies a performance obligation. A contract may not exist if there are doubts as to collectability of the amounts the\nCompany is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services transferred. If a contract is determined to be within the scope of\nTopic 606, the Company recognizes revenue as it satisfies a performance obligation. The largest portion of the Company’s\nrevenue is from net interest income which is not within the scope of Topic 606.\n116\nFIRST FINANCIAL NORTHWEST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table includes the Company’s noninterest income disaggregated by type of service for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nGain on sales of investment securities (1) $ — $ 27\nBOLI income (1) 1,081 1,004\nWealth management revenue 253 312\nDeposit related fees 331 311\nDebit card and ATM fees 625 625\nLoan related fees 275 919\nOther 208 49\nTotal noninterest income $ 2,773 $ 3,247\n____________\n(1) Not in scope of Topic 606\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, substantially all of the Company’s revenues under the scope of Topic 606 are\nfor performance obligations satisfied at a specified date.\nRevenues recognized within scope of Topic 606\nWealth management revenue: Our wealth management revenue consists of commissions received on the investment portfolio\nmanaged by Bank personnel but held by a third party. Commissions are earned on brokerage services and advisory services\nbased on contract terms at the onset of a new customer’s investment agreement or quarterly for ongoing services. Commissions\nare paid by the third party to the Bank when the performance obligation has been completed by both entities.\nDeposit related fees: Fees are earned on our deposit accounts for various products or services performed for our customers.\nFees include business account fees, non-sufficient fund fees, stop payment fees, wire services, safe deposit box, and others.\nThese fees are recognized on a daily, monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of service.\nDebit card and ATM fees: Fees are earned when a debit card issued by the Bank is used or when other bank’s customers use our\nATM services. Revenue is recognized at the time the fees are collected from the customer’s account or remitted by the VISA\ninterchange network.\nLoan related fees: Noninterest fee income is earned on our loans for servicing or annual fees on certain loan types. Fees are also\nearned on the prepayment of certain loans, and are recognized at the time the loan is paid off.\nOther: Fees earned on other services, such as merchant services or occasional non-recurring type services, are recognized at the\ntime of the event or the applicable billing cycle.\nContract Balances\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had no contract liabilities where the Company had an obligation to transfer\ngoods or services for which the Company had already received consideration. In addition, the Company had no material\nperformance obligations as of this date.\n117\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(i) Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nAn evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) was carried out as of December 31, 2023, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), and several other members of our\nsenior management. The CEO (Principal Executive Officer) and CFO (Principal Financial Officer) concluded that, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information we are\nrequired to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and\nreported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to First\nFinancial Northwest management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure, specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\n(a) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting.\nFirst Financial Northwest’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control system\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair\npresentation of published financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples.\nThis process includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as\nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that\nreceipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors\nof First Financial Northwest; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. A control\nprocedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives\nof the control system are met. Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\nAdditionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating\nthe cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and\nprocedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. As a result of these inherent\nlimitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nFirst Financial Northwest’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based\non that assessment, First Financial Northwest’s management believes that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nMoss Adams LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements as of December 31, 2023, which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n(b) Attestation report of the registered public accounting firm.\nNot applicable.\n118\n(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including our CEO and CFO, also conducted an evaluation of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting. There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule\n13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.
