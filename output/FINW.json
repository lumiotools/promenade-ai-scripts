The balance of nonperforming loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) was $17.8 million, $16.0 million, and $4.7 million as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively\n\n\n\n1 See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.\n\n“Our results during the third quarter reflect the resiliency of our existing business as well as the actions we’ve taken to enhance long-term growth,” said Kent Landvatter, CEO of FinWise. “We saw a notable step-up in loan originations and generated solid revenue coupled with a deceleration of our expense growth. Additionally, we continued to gain traction with new strategic programs, as we announced one new lending program in the quarter, which brings the total new lending programs to three so far this year. Overall, I am pleased with the operational performance of our company and I am excited about the outlook. We will remain laser focused on continuing to grow our business and will strive to continue to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.”\n\n**Selected Financial and Other Data**\n\n_($ in thousands, except per share amounts and FTEs)_| **As of and for the Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nAmount of loans originated| $| 1,448,251| $| 1,170,904| $| 1,061,327  \nNet income| $| 3,454| $| 3,180| $| 4,804  \nDiluted EPS| $| 0.25| $| 0.24| $| 0.37  \nReturn on average assets| 2.1| %| 2.1| %| 3.7| %  \nReturn on average equity| 8.3| %| 7.9| %| 12.8| %  \nYield on loans| 14.16| %| 14.89| %| 17.40| %  \nCost of interest-bearing deposits| 4.85| %| 4.80| %| 4.34| %  \nNet interest margin| 9.70| %| 10.31| %| 11.77| %  \nEfficiency ratio(1)| 67.5| %| 66.3| %| 50.4| %  \nTangible book value per share(2)| $| 12.90| $| 12.61| $| 12.04  \nTangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets(2)| 24.9| %| 26.8| %| 27.1| %  \nLeverage ratio (Bank under CBLR)| 20.3| %| 20.8| %| 22.1| %  \nFull-time equivalent (“FTEs”)| 194| 191| 158  \n  \n(1) This measure is not a measure recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and is therefore considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of this measure to its most comparable GAAP measure. The efficiency ratio is defined as total non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. The Company believes this measure is important as an indicator of productivity because it shows the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.(2) Tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible shareholders’ equity is defined as total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total shareholder’s equity to total assets. The Company had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. The Company has not considered loan servicing rights or loan trailing fee assets as intangible assets for purposes of this calculation. As a result, tangible shareholders’ equity is the same as total shareholders’ equity at the end of each of the periods indicated.\n\n**__Net Interest Income__** Net interest income was $14.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $14.6 million for the prior quarter and $14.4 million for the prior year period. The increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to average balance increases in the loans held-for-sale and loans held for investment portfolios and was partially offset by yield decreases in both the loans held-for-sale and loans held for investment portfolios. The increase from the prior year period was primarily due to increases in the average balances of the Company’s loans held-for-sale and loans held for investment portfolios and was partially offset by yield decreases on those same portfolios as well as increased rates and volumes on the certificate of deposit balances. Third quarter 2024 net interest income includes a $0.5 million one-time decrease for accrued interest not previously reversed at the time loans were deemed nonperforming.\n\nLoan originations totaled $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 billion for the prior quarter and $1.1 billion for the prior year period. Originations through the first three weeks of October 2024 are tracking at a pace modestly lower than third quarter 2024 originations, which included an expected seasonal increase from the Company’s student loan strategic program.\n\nNet interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 9.70%, compared to 10.31% for the prior quarter and 11.77% for the prior year period. The decrease in net interest margin from the prior quarter is primarily attributable to the Company’s strategy to reduce the average credit risk in the loan portfolio by increasing its investment in higher quality but lower yielding loans and the previously described one-time decrease in net interest income. The net interest margin decrease from the prior year period resulted primarily from the Company’s strategy to reduce average credit risk in the portfolio combined with the increased cost of funds as the Bank competed in the national market for funds to support the asset growth.\n\n**__Provision for Credit Losses__** The Company’s provision for credit losses was $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.4 million for the prior quarter and $3.1 million for the prior year period. The provision for credit losses decreased when compared to the prior quarter due primarily to the Company’s periodic assessment of the qualitative factors resulting in the removal of the qualitative factor related to COVID, partially offset by an increase in other qualitative factors and slightly higher charge-offs. The decrease from the prior year period was primarily related to qualitative factors which had been adjusted upward in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in special mention, non-accrual and nonperforming assets primarily related to the SBA portfolio.\n\n**__Non-interest Income__**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nNon-interest income  \nStrategic Program fees| $| 4,862| $| 4,035| $| 3,945  \nGain on sale of loans| 393| 356| 357  \nSBA loan servicing fees and servicing asset amortization| 87| 204| (138| )  \nChange in fair value on investment in BFG| (100| )| (200| )| (500| )  \nOther miscellaneous income| 812| 771| 1,228  \nTotal non-interest income| $| 6,054| $| 5,166| $| 4,892  \n  \nThe increase in non-interest income from the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in originations related to the Company’s Strategic Programs. The increase in non-interest income from the prior year period was primarily due to increased fees associated with originations of Strategic Program loans, partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous income related to a gain on the resolution of a forbearance agreement in the Company’s SBA lending program recognized in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**__Non-interest Expense__**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nNon-interest expense  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 9,659| $| 8,609| $| 6,416  \nProfessional services| 1,331| 1,282| 750  \nOccupancy and equipment expenses| 1,046| 1,121| 958  \nOther operating expenses| 2,013| 2,206| 1,609  \nTotal non-interest expense| $| 14,048| $| 13,218| $| 9,733  \n  \nThe increase in non-interest expense from the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits, including a catch-up in bonus accrual expense of $0.4 million to reflect updated performance award estimates, a full quarter of amortization of the second quarter deferred compensation awards, and a full quarter of compensation and benefits for employees hired during the second quarter. The increase in non-interest expense from the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits due mainly to increasing headcount and increases in professional services and other operating expenses driven by increased spending to support the growth in the Company’s business infrastructure.Reflecting the expenses incurred to develop the Company’s business infrastructure, the Company’s efficiency ratio was 67.5% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 66.3% for the prior quarter and 50.4% for the prior year period. As a result of the infrastructure build, the Company anticipates the efficiency ratio will remain elevated until the Company begins to realize the revenues associated with the new programs being developed.\n\n**__Tax Rate__** The Company’s effective tax rate was 25.1% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.9% for the prior quarter and 26.1% for the prior year period. The increase from the prior quarter was due primarily to more favorable resolution of historical state tax matters during the second quarter of 2024. The decrease from the prior year period was primarily due to a reduction in permanent differences impacting income tax expense.\n\n**__Net Income__** Net income was $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.2 million for the prior quarter and $4.8 million for the prior year period. The changes in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter and prior year period are the result of the factors discussed above.\n\n**__Balance Sheet__** The Company’s total assets were $683.0 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase from $617.8 million as of June 30, 2024 and $555.1 million as of September 30, 2023. The increase in total assets from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase of $30.5 million in investment securities available-for-sale and continued growth in the Company’s loans held for investment, net, and loans held-for-sale portfolios of $19.6 million and $17.5 million, respectively. The increase in total assets compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in the Company’s loans held for investment, net, and loans held-for-sale portfolios of $93.9 million and $38.3 million, respectively, as well as an increase in investment securities available-for-sale of $30.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $48.3 million in interest-bearing cash deposits.\n\nThe following table shows the gross loans held for investment balances as of the dates indicated:\n\n**9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \n---|---|---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **Amount**| **% of total loans**| **Amount**| **% of total loans**| **Amount**| **% of total loans**  \nSBA| $| 251,439| 57.9| %| $| 249,281| 60.2| %| $| 219,305| 64.9| %  \nCommercial leases| 64,277| 14.8| %| 56,529| 13.7| %| 31,466| 9.3| %  \nCommercial, non-real estate| 3,025| 0.7| %| 1,999| 0.5| %| 2,578| 0.8| %  \nResidential real estate| 41,391| 9.5| %| 42,317| 10.2| %| 34,891| 10.3| %  \nStrategic Program loans| 19,409| 4.5| %| 17,861| 4.3| %| 20,040| 5.9| %  \nCommercial real estate:  \nOwner occupied| 32,480| 7.5| %| 28,340| 6.8| %| 17,092| 5.1| %  \nNon-owner occupied| 2,736| 0.7| %| 2,134| 0.5| %| 4,588| 1.4| %  \nConsumer| 19,206| 4.4| %| 15,880| 3.8| %| 7,675| 2.3| %  \nTotal period end loans| $| 433,963| 100.0| %| $| 414,341| 100.0| %| $| 337,635| 100.0| %  \n  \nNote: SBA loans as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 include $156.3 million, $147.8 million and $112.5 million, respectively, of SBA 7(a) loan balances that are guaranteed by the SBA. The held for investment balance on Strategic Program loans with annual interest rates below 36% as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $3.2 million, $2.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\n\nTotal gross loans held for investment as of September 30, 2024 were $434.0 million, an increase from $414.3 million and $337.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in the commercial leases, owner occupied commercial real estate, consumer and SBA loan portfolios. The increase compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in the commercial leases, SBA, commercial real estate owner occupied, and consumer loan portfolios.\n\nThe following table shows the Company’s deposit composition as of the dates indicated:\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**​**| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \n _($ in thousands)_| **Amount**| **Percent**| **Amount**| **Percent**| **Amount**| **Percent**  \nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits| $| 142,785| 29.2| %| $| 107,083| 24.9| %| $| 94,268| 24.4| %  \nInterest-bearing deposits:  \nDemand| 58,984| 12.1| %| 48,319| 11.3| %| 87,753| 22.7| %  \nSavings| 9,592| 1.9| %| 9,746| 2.3| %| 8,738| 2.3| %  \nMoney market| 15,027| 3.1| %| 9,788| 2.3| %| 15,450| 3.9| %  \nTime certificates of deposit| 262,271| 53.7| %| 254,259| 59.2| %| 180,544| 46.7| %  \nTotal period end deposits| $| 488,659| 100.0| %| $| 429,195| 100.0| %| $| 386,753| 100.0| %  \n  \nThe increase in total deposits from June 30, 2024 was driven primarily by increases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits and brokered time certificates of deposits. The increase in total deposits from September 30, 2023 was driven primarily by an increase in brokered time certificate of deposits and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. As of September 30, 2024, 35.4% of deposits at the Bank were uninsured, compared to 31.3% as of June 30, 2024, and 31.7% as of September 30, 2023. Uninsured deposits at the Bank as of September 30, 2024 includes 8.5% of total deposits contractually required to be maintained at the Bank pursuant to the Company’s Strategic Program agreements and an additional 9.4% of total deposits associated with the parent holding company or the Bank.\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 increased $4.6 million to $170.4 million from $165.8 million at June 30, 2024. Compared to September 30, 2023, total shareholders’ equity increased by $20.0 million from $150.4 million. The increase from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the Company’s net income. The increase from September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the Company’s net income as well as the additional capital issued in exchange for the Company’s increased ownership in BFG, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock under the Company’s share repurchase program.\n\n**Bank Regulatory Capital Ratios** The following table presents the leverage ratios for the Bank as of the dates indicated as determined under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation:\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n _Capital Ratios_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**| **Well-Capitalized Requirement**  \nLeverage ratio| 20.3%| 20.8%| 22.1%| 9.0%  \n  \nThe leverage ratio decrease from the prior quarter resulted primarily from assets growing at a faster pace than earnings generated by operations. The leverage ratio decrease from the prior year period resulted primarily from the growth in the loan portfolio. The Bank’s capital levels remain significantly above well-capitalized guidelines as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program** Since the share repurchase program’s inception in March 2024 through September 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased a total of 44,608 shares for $0.5 million. There were no shares repurchased during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Asset Quality** The recorded balances of nonperforming loans were $30.6 million, or 7.1% of total loans held for investment, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $27.9 million, or 6.5% of total loans held for investment, as of June 30, 2024 and $10.7 million, or 3.2% of total loans held for investment, as of September 30, 2023. The balances of nonperforming loans guaranteed by the SBA were $17.8 million, $16.0 million, and $4.7 million as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in nonperforming loans from the prior quarter was primarily attributable to two SBA 7(a) loans totaling $5.7 million classified as nonperforming during the third quarter of 2024 of which $4.4 million was guaranteed by the SBA. The increase in nonperforming loans from the prior year period was primarily attributable to loans in the SBA 7(a) loan portfolio being classified as non-accrual mainly due to the negative impact of elevated interest rates on the Company’s small business borrowers. The Company’s allowance for credit losses to total loans held for investment was 2.9% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 3.2% as of June 30, 2024 and 3.8% as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in the ratio from the prior quarter and prior year periods was primarily due to the Company’s increased retention of most of the originated guaranteed portions in its SBA 7(a) loan program as well as removal of the qualitative factor related to COVID and its subsequent implications due to improving economic conditions.\n\nThe Company’s net charge-offs were $2.4 million, $1.9 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase from the prior quarter is primarily due to increased net charge-offs in the Strategic Program loans portfolio. The increase from the prior year period is primarily due to resolution of a large small business recovery that reduced net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses and asset quality ratios for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n​ _($ in thousands)_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \nBeginning balance| $| 13,127| $| 12,632| $| 12,321  \nProvision for credit losses(1)| 1,944| 2,393| 2,910  \n**Charge offs**  \nResidential real estate| (27| )| —| —  \nCommercial real estate  \nOwner occupied| (103| )| —| (31| )  \nNon-owner occupied| (221| )| —| —  \nCommercial and industrial| (96| )| (184| )| (107| )  \nConsumer| (15| )| (18| )| (28| )  \nLease financing receivables| (113| )| (69| )| —  \nStrategic Program loans| (2,360| )| (1,962| )| (2,748| )  \n**Recoveries**  \nResidential real estate| 3| 3| 3  \nCommercial real estate  \nOwner occupied| 219| —| 389  \nCommercial and industrial| 2| 15| 18  \nConsumer| 4| 1| 2  \nLease financing receivables| 8| 7| —  \nStrategic Program loans| 289| 309| 257  \nEnding Balance| $| 12,661| $| 13,127| $| 12,986  \n** _Asset Quality Ratios_**| **As of and For the Three Months Ended**  \n _($ in thousands, annualized ratios)_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nNonperforming loans(2)| $| 30,648| $| 27,907| $| 10,703  \nNonperforming loans to total loans held for investment| 7.1| %| 6.5| %| 3.2| %  \nNet charge offs to average loans held for investment| 2.3| %| 1.9| %| 2.8| %  \nAllowance for credit losses to loans held for investment| 2.9| %| 3.2| %| 3.8| %  \nNet charge offs| $| 2,409| $| 1,898| $| 2,245  \n  \n(1) Excludes the provision for unfunded commitments.(2) Nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 include $17.8 million, $16.0 million, and $4.7 million, respectively, of SBA 7(a) loan balances that are guaranteed by the SBA.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** FinWise will host a conference call today at 5:30 PM ET to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.

The balance of nonperforming loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) was $17.8 million, $16.0 million, and $4.7 million as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively\n\n\n\n1 See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure.\n\n“Our results during the third quarter reflect the resiliency of our existing business as well as the actions we’ve taken to enhance long-term growth,” said Kent Landvatter, CEO of FinWise. “We saw a notable step-up in loan originations and generated solid revenue coupled with a deceleration of our expense growth. Additionally, we continued to gain traction with new strategic programs, as we announced one new lending program in the quarter, which brings the total new lending programs to three so far this year. Overall, I am pleased with the operational performance of our company and I am excited about the outlook. We will remain laser focused on continuing to grow our business and will strive to continue to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders.”\n\n**Selected Financial and Other Data**\n\n_($ in thousands, except per share amounts and FTEs)_| **As of and for the Three Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nAmount of loans originated| $| 1,448,251| $| 1,170,904| $| 1,061,327  \nNet income| $| 3,454| $| 3,180| $| 4,804  \nDiluted EPS| $| 0.25| $| 0.24| $| 0.37  \nReturn on average assets| 2.1| %| 2.1| %| 3.7| %  \nReturn on average equity| 8.3| %| 7.9| %| 12.8| %  \nYield on loans| 14.16| %| 14.89| %| 17.40| %  \nCost of interest-bearing deposits| 4.85| %| 4.80| %| 4.34| %  \nNet interest margin| 9.70| %| 10.31| %| 11.77| %  \nEfficiency ratio(1)| 67.5| %| 66.3| %| 50.4| %  \nTangible book value per share(2)| $| 12.90| $| 12.61| $| 12.04  \nTangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets(2)| 24.9| %| 26.8| %| 27.1| %  \nLeverage ratio (Bank under CBLR)| 20.3| %| 20.8| %| 22.1| %  \nFull-time equivalent (“FTEs”)| 194| 191| 158  \n  \n(1) This measure is not a measure recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and is therefore considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of this measure to its most comparable GAAP measure. The efficiency ratio is defined as total non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. The Company believes this measure is important as an indicator of productivity because it shows the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.(2) Tangible shareholders’ equity to tangible assets is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible shareholders’ equity is defined as total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total shareholder’s equity to total assets. The Company had no goodwill or other intangible assets at the end of any period indicated. The Company has not considered loan servicing rights or loan trailing fee assets as intangible assets for purposes of this calculation. As a result, tangible shareholders’ equity is the same as total shareholders’ equity at the end of each of the periods indicated.\n\n**__Net Interest Income__** Net interest income was $14.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $14.6 million for the prior quarter and $14.4 million for the prior year period. The increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to average balance increases in the loans held-for-sale and loans held for investment portfolios and was partially offset by yield decreases in both the loans held-for-sale and loans held for investment portfolios. The increase from the prior year period was primarily due to increases in the average balances of the Company’s loans held-for-sale and loans held for investment portfolios and was partially offset by yield decreases on those same portfolios as well as increased rates and volumes on the certificate of deposit balances. Third quarter 2024 net interest income includes a $0.5 million one-time decrease for accrued interest not previously reversed at the time loans were deemed nonperforming.\n\nLoan originations totaled $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 billion for the prior quarter and $1.1 billion for the prior year period. Originations through the first three weeks of October 2024 are tracking at a pace modestly lower than third quarter 2024 originations, which included an expected seasonal increase from the Company’s student loan strategic program.\n\nNet interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 9.70%, compared to 10.31% for the prior quarter and 11.77% for the prior year period. The decrease in net interest margin from the prior quarter is primarily attributable to the Company’s strategy to reduce the average credit risk in the loan portfolio by increasing its investment in higher quality but lower yielding loans and the previously described one-time decrease in net interest income. The net interest margin decrease from the prior year period resulted primarily from the Company’s strategy to reduce average credit risk in the portfolio combined with the increased cost of funds as the Bank competed in the national market for funds to support the asset growth.\n\n**__Provision for Credit Losses__** The Company’s provision for credit losses was $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.4 million for the prior quarter and $3.1 million for the prior year period. The provision for credit losses decreased when compared to the prior quarter due primarily to the Company’s periodic assessment of the qualitative factors resulting in the removal of the qualitative factor related to COVID, partially offset by an increase in other qualitative factors and slightly higher charge-offs. The decrease from the prior year period was primarily related to qualitative factors which had been adjusted upward in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in special mention, non-accrual and nonperforming assets primarily related to the SBA portfolio.\n\n**__Non-interest Income__**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nNon-interest income  \nStrategic Program fees| $| 4,862| $| 4,035| $| 3,945  \nGain on sale of loans| 393| 356| 357  \nSBA loan servicing fees and servicing asset amortization| 87| 204| (138| )  \nChange in fair value on investment in BFG| (100| )| (200| )| (500| )  \nOther miscellaneous income| 812| 771| 1,228  \nTotal non-interest income| $| 6,054| $| 5,166| $| 4,892  \n  \nThe increase in non-interest income from the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in originations related to the Company’s Strategic Programs. The increase in non-interest income from the prior year period was primarily due to increased fees associated with originations of Strategic Program loans, partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous income related to a gain on the resolution of a forbearance agreement in the Company’s SBA lending program recognized in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**__Non-interest Expense__**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nNon-interest expense  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 9,659| $| 8,609| $| 6,416  \nProfessional services| 1,331| 1,282| 750  \nOccupancy and equipment expenses| 1,046| 1,121| 958  \nOther operating expenses| 2,013| 2,206| 1,609  \nTotal non-interest expense| $| 14,048| $| 13,218| $| 9,733  \n  \nThe increase in non-interest expense from the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits, including a catch-up in bonus accrual expense of $0.4 million to reflect updated performance award estimates, a full quarter of amortization of the second quarter deferred compensation awards, and a full quarter of compensation and benefits for employees hired during the second quarter. The increase in non-interest expense from the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits due mainly to increasing headcount and increases in professional services and other operating expenses driven by increased spending to support the growth in the Company’s business infrastructure.Reflecting the expenses incurred to develop the Company’s business infrastructure, the Company’s efficiency ratio was 67.5% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 66.3% for the prior quarter and 50.4% for the prior year period. As a result of the infrastructure build, the Company anticipates the efficiency ratio will remain elevated until the Company begins to realize the revenues associated with the new programs being developed.\n\n**__Tax Rate__** The Company’s effective tax rate was 25.1% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 23.9% for the prior quarter and 26.1% for the prior year period. The increase from the prior quarter was due primarily to more favorable resolution of historical state tax matters during the second quarter of 2024. The decrease from the prior year period was primarily due to a reduction in permanent differences impacting income tax expense.\n\n**__Net Income__** Net income was $3.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.2 million for the prior quarter and $4.8 million for the prior year period. The changes in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior quarter and prior year period are the result of the factors discussed above.\n\n**__Balance Sheet__** The Company’s total assets were $683.0 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase from $617.8 million as of June 30, 2024 and $555.1 million as of September 30, 2023. The increase in total assets from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase of $30.5 million in investment securities available-for-sale and continued growth in the Company’s loans held for investment, net, and loans held-for-sale portfolios of $19.6 million and $17.5 million, respectively. The increase in total assets compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in the Company’s loans held for investment, net, and loans held-for-sale portfolios of $93.9 million and $38.3 million, respectively, as well as an increase in investment securities available-for-sale of $30.5 million, partially offset by a decrease of $48.3 million in interest-bearing cash deposits.\n\nThe following table shows the gross loans held for investment balances as of the dates indicated:\n\n**9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \n---|---|---  \n _($ in thousands)_| **Amount**| **% of total loans**| **Amount**| **% of total loans**| **Amount**| **% of total loans**  \nSBA| $| 251,439| 57.9| %| $| 249,281| 60.2| %| $| 219,305| 64.9| %  \nCommercial leases| 64,277| 14.8| %| 56,529| 13.7| %| 31,466| 9.3| %  \nCommercial, non-real estate| 3,025| 0.7| %| 1,999| 0.5| %| 2,578| 0.8| %  \nResidential real estate| 41,391| 9.5| %| 42,317| 10.2| %| 34,891| 10.3| %  \nStrategic Program loans| 19,409| 4.5| %| 17,861| 4.3| %| 20,040| 5.9| %  \nCommercial real estate:  \nOwner occupied| 32,480| 7.5| %| 28,340| 6.8| %| 17,092| 5.1| %  \nNon-owner occupied| 2,736| 0.7| %| 2,134| 0.5| %| 4,588| 1.4| %  \nConsumer| 19,206| 4.4| %| 15,880| 3.8| %| 7,675| 2.3| %  \nTotal period end loans| $| 433,963| 100.0| %| $| 414,341| 100.0| %| $| 337,635| 100.0| %  \n  \nNote: SBA loans as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 include $156.3 million, $147.8 million and $112.5 million, respectively, of SBA 7(a) loan balances that are guaranteed by the SBA. The held for investment balance on Strategic Program loans with annual interest rates below 36% as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $3.2 million, $2.6 million and $4.4 million, respectively.\n\nTotal gross loans held for investment as of September 30, 2024 were $434.0 million, an increase from $414.3 million and $337.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily due to increases in the commercial leases, owner occupied commercial real estate, consumer and SBA loan portfolios. The increase compared to September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in the commercial leases, SBA, commercial real estate owner occupied, and consumer loan portfolios.\n\nThe following table shows the Company’s deposit composition as of the dates indicated:\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n**​**| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \n _($ in thousands)_| **Amount**| **Percent**| **Amount**| **Percent**| **Amount**| **Percent**  \nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits| $| 142,785| 29.2| %| $| 107,083| 24.9| %| $| 94,268| 24.4| %  \nInterest-bearing deposits:  \nDemand| 58,984| 12.1| %| 48,319| 11.3| %| 87,753| 22.7| %  \nSavings| 9,592| 1.9| %| 9,746| 2.3| %| 8,738| 2.3| %  \nMoney market| 15,027| 3.1| %| 9,788| 2.3| %| 15,450| 3.9| %  \nTime certificates of deposit| 262,271| 53.7| %| 254,259| 59.2| %| 180,544| 46.7| %  \nTotal period end deposits| $| 488,659| 100.0| %| $| 429,195| 100.0| %| $| 386,753| 100.0| %  \n  \nThe increase in total deposits from June 30, 2024 was driven primarily by increases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits and brokered time certificates of deposits. The increase in total deposits from September 30, 2023 was driven primarily by an increase in brokered time certificate of deposits and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. As of September 30, 2024, 35.4% of deposits at the Bank were uninsured, compared to 31.3% as of June 30, 2024, and 31.7% as of September 30, 2023. Uninsured deposits at the Bank as of September 30, 2024 includes 8.5% of total deposits contractually required to be maintained at the Bank pursuant to the Company’s Strategic Program agreements and an additional 9.4% of total deposits associated with the parent holding company or the Bank.\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 increased $4.6 million to $170.4 million from $165.8 million at June 30, 2024. Compared to September 30, 2023, total shareholders’ equity increased by $20.0 million from $150.4 million. The increase from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to the Company’s net income. The increase from September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the Company’s net income as well as the additional capital issued in exchange for the Company’s increased ownership in BFG, partially offset by the repurchase of common stock under the Company’s share repurchase program.\n\n**Bank Regulatory Capital Ratios** The following table presents the leverage ratios for the Bank as of the dates indicated as determined under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation:\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n _Capital Ratios_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**| **Well-Capitalized Requirement**  \nLeverage ratio| 20.3%| 20.8%| 22.1%| 9.0%  \n  \nThe leverage ratio decrease from the prior quarter resulted primarily from assets growing at a faster pace than earnings generated by operations. The leverage ratio decrease from the prior year period resulted primarily from the growth in the loan portfolio. The Bank’s capital levels remain significantly above well-capitalized guidelines as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program** Since the share repurchase program’s inception in March 2024 through September 30, 2024, the Company has repurchased a total of 44,608 shares for $0.5 million. There were no shares repurchased during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Asset Quality** The recorded balances of nonperforming loans were $30.6 million, or 7.1% of total loans held for investment, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $27.9 million, or 6.5% of total loans held for investment, as of June 30, 2024 and $10.7 million, or 3.2% of total loans held for investment, as of September 30, 2023. The balances of nonperforming loans guaranteed by the SBA were $17.8 million, $16.0 million, and $4.7 million as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in nonperforming loans from the prior quarter was primarily attributable to two SBA 7(a) loans totaling $5.7 million classified as nonperforming during the third quarter of 2024 of which $4.4 million was guaranteed by the SBA. The increase in nonperforming loans from the prior year period was primarily attributable to loans in the SBA 7(a) loan portfolio being classified as non-accrual mainly due to the negative impact of elevated interest rates on the Company’s small business borrowers. The Company’s allowance for credit losses to total loans held for investment was 2.9% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 3.2% as of June 30, 2024 and 3.8% as of September 30, 2023. The decrease in the ratio from the prior quarter and prior year periods was primarily due to the Company’s increased retention of most of the originated guaranteed portions in its SBA 7(a) loan program as well as removal of the qualitative factor related to COVID and its subsequent implications due to improving economic conditions.\n\nThe Company’s net charge-offs were $2.4 million, $1.9 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase from the prior quarter is primarily due to increased net charge-offs in the Strategic Program loans portfolio. The increase from the prior year period is primarily due to resolution of a large small business recovery that reduced net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the allowance for credit losses and asset quality ratios for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n​ _($ in thousands)_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nAllowance for credit losses:  \nBeginning balance| $| 13,127| $| 12,632| $| 12,321  \nProvision for credit losses(1)| 1,944| 2,393| 2,910  \n**Charge offs**  \nResidential real estate| (27| )| —| —  \nCommercial real estate  \nOwner occupied| (103| )| —| (31| )  \nNon-owner occupied| (221| )| —| —  \nCommercial and industrial| (96| )| (184| )| (107| )  \nConsumer| (15| )| (18| )| (28| )  \nLease financing receivables| (113| )| (69| )| —  \nStrategic Program loans| (2,360| )| (1,962| )| (2,748| )  \n**Recoveries**  \nResidential real estate| 3| 3| 3  \nCommercial real estate  \nOwner occupied| 219| —| 389  \nCommercial and industrial| 2| 15| 18  \nConsumer| 4| 1| 2  \nLease financing receivables| 8| 7| —  \nStrategic Program loans| 289| 309| 257  \nEnding Balance| $| 12,661| $| 13,127| $| 12,986  \n** _Asset Quality Ratios_**| **As of and For the Three Months Ended**  \n _($ in thousands, annualized ratios)_| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nNonperforming loans(2)| $| 30,648| $| 27,907| $| 10,703  \nNonperforming loans to total loans held for investment| 7.1| %| 6.5| %| 3.2| %  \nNet charge offs to average loans held for investment| 2.3| %| 1.9| %| 2.8| %  \nAllowance for credit losses to loans held for investment| 2.9| %| 3.2| %| 3.8| %  \nNet charge offs| $| 2,409| $| 1,898| $| 2,245  \n  \n(1) Excludes the provision for unfunded commitments.(2) Nonperforming loans as of September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023 include $17.8 million, $16.0 million, and $4.7 million, respectively, of SBA 7(a) loan balances that are guaranteed by the SBA.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** FinWise will host a conference call today at 5:30 PM ET to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.
