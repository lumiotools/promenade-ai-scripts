(Nasdaq: RGNX) today announced that AFFINITY DUCHENNE®, the multi-center, open-label trial of RGX-202, a potential best-in-class gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne), has advanced to pivotal stage and dosed its first patient. The company also announced new, positive efficacy and safety data from the Phase I/II portion of the study, including the first functional data.\n\n\"The initiation of our pivotal trial and newly released positive functional data are exciting milestones on our path to rapidly deliver RGX-202, the only next generation gene therapy in pivotal phase, to the Duchenne community,\" said Curran M. Simpson President and Chief Executive Officer of REGENXBIO. \"The totality of our data demonstrates that RGX-202 provides evidence of improving outcomes for boys with Duchenne and altering the trajectory of this devastating disease, with consistent, robust expression of our novel microdystrophin translating into significant clinical benefit. Based on the strength of the Phase I/II data and our positive discussions and alignment with the FDA, we are quickly advancing RGX-202 toward a BLA filing in 2026 using the accelerated approval pathway. We continue to evaluate opportunities to expand the RGX-202 program to benefit Duchenne patients worldwide.\"\n\n\"There remains a critical need for new therapeutic options for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy\", said Aravindhan Veerapandiyan M.D., Arkansas Children's Hospital. \"I am very pleased to see the advancement of the RGX-202 program to the pivotal stage, which offers promise for a broader patient population and am highly encouraged by the functional data presented today demonstrating RGX-202's potential to alter the course of the disease. The safety, functional, and biomarker data shared today reinforce the positive feedback from families, highlighting improvements in patients' daily activities and underscoring the potential benefits of this treatment.\"\n\n**AFFINITY DUCHENNE Data Updates**\n\n _Functional Data_ Today, REGENXBIO announced positive functional results from the first five participants in the Phase I/II portion of the ongoing AFFINITY DUCHENNE trial. Results include 12-month data from three dose level 1 patients aged 4-10 and nine-month data from two dose level 2 (pivotal dose) patients aged 8 and 12.\n\nIn all five participants, across both dose levels, RGX-202 demonstrates evidence of positively impacting disease trajectory, with patients demonstrating stable or improved function on the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and timed function tests. Results were measured against external natural history controls matched for age and baseline function.\n\n_Pivotal Dose Functional Data_ Pivotal dose participants demonstrated improved performance on NSAA and timed function tests at nine months, exceeding external natural history controls. The NSAA mean score at this dose improved by 5.5 points. [Figure 1]\n\n[![](/static-files/be13d66f-f2b4-4417-b80a-875350d2a8fd)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2560100/RGX_202_DL2.html)\n\nAll dose level 1 participants demonstrated improved performance and exceeded external natural history controls at 12 months. [Figure 2]\n\n[![](/static-files/ade8b43b-2dd8-4fa7-a8c5-1410037e70f6)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2560099/RGX_202_DL1.html)\n\nAdditionally, dose level 1 participants' timed task velocity changes exceeded minimal clinically important difference (MCID) benchmarks at 12 months, a measure referenced by the FDA in the approval of the available gene therapy.\n\n_Biomarker Data_ REGENXBIO also announced new biomarker data that continues to support consistent, high expression and transduction of RGX-202 microdystrophin. RGX-202 was appropriately localized to the sarcolemma, demonstrating the differentiated construct with the CT-Domain is appropriately targeting the muscle.\n\nRGX-202 microdystrophin expression results in ambulatory patients aged 8+ are the highest reported microdystrophin levels across approved or investigational gene therapies.\n\n**Mean at 12 Weeks**(min,max)| **Dose Level 1****1x10 14 GC/kg**| **Dose Level 2****2x10 14 GC/kg**  \n---|---|---  \n**Age range**(number with data)| **4-7**(2)| **8-11** (1) | **4-7** (1) | **8-11**(5)  \n**RGX-202 Microdystrophin****% normal control**(Western Blot)| **60.6**(37.8, 83.4)| **10.4**(n/a)| **77.2**(n/a)| **39.7**(20.8, 75.7)  \n**VCN copies/nucleus**(qPCR)| **9.8**(7.4,12.1)| **5.4**(n/a)| **55.4**(n/a)| **17.8**(12.0,30.7)  \n**Positive Fibers %**(Immunofluorescence)| **79.3**(n/a)| **34.6**(n/a)| **71.1**(n/a)| **45.7**(21.3,70.6)  \n  \n_Safety and Tolerability Data_ As of November 1, 2024, RGX-202 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no AEs of special interest (AESIs). Common drug-related AEs included nausea, vomiting and fatigue. All resolved and are typically anticipated with gene therapy administration.\n\n**RGX-202 Treatment****Emergent Adverse Events** |  **Dose Level 1****Dose Evaluation****(1x10 14 GC/kg)**| **Dose Level 2****Dose Evaluation / Expansion****(2x10 14 GC/kg)**| **Dose Level 2****Younger Boys****(2x10 14 GC/kg)**| **Total****n=11**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Age Range**(number dosed)| **4-11**(n=3)| **4-11**(n=7)| **1-3**(n=1)| **All Ages**  \n**SAE**|  0| 0| 0| 0  \n**AESI**|  Central or peripheral neurotoxicity| 0| 0| 0| 0  \nDrug-induced liver injury| 0| 0| 0| 0  \nThrombocytopenia| 0| 0| 0| 0  \n**Myocarditis**|  0| 0| 0| 0  \n**Myositis**|  0| 0| 0| 0  \n  \n**Pivotal Study** The Phase I/II AFFINITY DUCHENNE trial has been expanded into a multicenter, open-label pivotal Phase I/II/III trial of RGX-202. The pivotal trial is expected to support a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission using the accelerated approval pathway in 2026. \n\nBased on a positive End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, the pivotal trial will evaluate the efficacy of RGX-202 at dose level 2 (2×1014 GC/kg) in approximately 30 ambulatory patients aged 1 and older. Patients under 4 years old have no access to gene therapy, and REGENXBIO is the only gene therapy sponsor recruiting patients in this age group in the U.S.\n\nTo support accelerated approval, the primary endpoint is the proportion of participants whose RGX-202 microdystrophin expression is ≥10% at Week 12, and secondary endpoints include change from baseline on timed function tests including TTStand, 10MWR and TTClimb in participants ages 4 and older. Participants aged 1 to < 4 years will be evaluated using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-Third Edition (PDMS-3) and SV95C. Patients will be assessed on the NSAA as an exploratory endpoint.\n\n**Webcast Details** REGENXBIO will host a webcast featuring Dr. Veerapandiyan, and Michael Kelly, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer of CureDuchenne, to discuss today's developments at 8:00 a.m. EST.\n\nThe live webcast can be accessed [here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304947-1&h=3483360914&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwsw.com%2Fwebcast%2Fcc%2Frgnx4%2F1447506&a=here) and in the Investors section of REGENXBIO's website at [www.regenxbio.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304947-1&h=981743549&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regenxbio.com%2F&a=www.regenxbio.com). An archived replay of the webcast will be available for approximately 30 days following the presentation.\n\n**About RGX-202** RGX-202 is a potential best-in-class investigational gene therapy designed for improved function and outcomes in Duchenne. RGX-202 is the only gene therapy approved or in late-stage development for Duchenne with a differentiated microdystrophin construct that encodes key regions of naturally occurring dystrophin, including the C-Terminal (CT) domain. In preclinical studies, the CT domain has been shown to protect the muscle from contraction-induced stress and improve its ability to repair itself.\n\nAdditional design features, including codon optimization and reduction of CpG content, may potentially improve gene expression, increase protein translation efficiency and reduce immunogenicity. RGX-202 is designed to support the delivery and targeted expression of genes throughout skeletal and heart muscle using the NAV® AAV8 vector and a well-characterized muscle-specific promoter (Spc5-12). RGX-202 is manufactured using REGENXBIO's proprietary, high-yielding NAVXpress™ suspension-based platform process.\n\n**About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy** Duchenne is a severe, progressive, degenerative muscle disease, affecting 1 in 3,500 to 5,000 boys born each year worldwide. Duchenne is caused by mutations in the Duchenne gene which encodes for dystrophin, a protein involved in muscle cell structure and signaling pathways. Without dystrophin, muscles throughout the body degenerate and become weak, eventually leading to loss of movement and independence, required support for breathing, cardiomyopathy and premature death.\n\n**ABOUT REGENXBIO Inc.**REGENXBIO is a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. Since its founding in 2009, REGENXBIO has pioneered the development of AAV Therapeutics, an innovative class of gene therapy medicines. REGENXBIO is advancing a pipeline of AAV Therapeutics for rare and retinal diseases, including RGX-202 for the treatment of Duchenne, RGX-121 for the treatment of MPS II, and ABBV-RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, being developed in collaboration with AbbVie.

(Nasdaq: RGNX) today reported financial results and recent operational highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"It has been a turning point year for REGENXBIO, as we are on the cusp of advancing AFFINITY DUCHENNE® to pivotal phase, completing our first BLA for MPS II and entering pivotal phase in a second indication within our global eyecare collaboration with AbbVie,\" said Curran M. Simpson, President and Chief Executive Officer of REGENXBIO. \"The rapid progress we are making in RGX-202, which continues to demonstrate its potential to be a best-in-class gene therapy for Duchenne, is highly encouraging, and the near-term filing of our BLA for RGX-121 represents a major milestone for the patient community in need of a treatment to address both the neurocognitive and systemic effects of MPS II. The recent fellow eye data presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology meeting demonstrate the potential of ABBV-RGX-314 to preserve vision long-term for patients with wet AMD as a one-time treatment for both eyes. Each of these programs represent one-time treatments with the potential to transform the trajectory and management of disease for patients in need of new and better options, and we look forward to continued momentum and important milestones in the last quarter of the year.\"\n\n**PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS AND MILESTONES**\n\n**Neuromuscular Disease:** RGX-202 is a potential best-in-class gene therapy designed to deliver a differentiated, novel microdystrophin gene for improved function and outcomes for patients living with Duchenne.\n\n  * In the Phase I/II AFFINITY DUCHENNE trial of RGX-202, the last patient has been dosed in the dose level 2 (pivotal dose) expansion cohort for ages 4-11 and the first patient has been dosed in the cohort for ages 1-3. Patients with Duchenne under 4 years old have no access to gene therapy, and REGENXBIO is the only gene therapy sponsor recruiting patients in this age group in the U.S.\n  * A clinical trials application (CTA) for RGX-202 has been authorized by Health Canada. REGENXBIO expects to initiate sites in Canada in H1 2025.\n  * REGENXBIO plans to share a full program update this month, including pivotal trial design and plans for accelerated approval, as well as initial strength and functional assessment data for both dose levels of the AFFINITY DUCHENNE trial.\n\n\n\n**Retinal Disease:** ABBV-RGX‑314, being developed in collaboration with AbbVie, is potentially the first-in-class treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).\n\n_ABBV-RGX-314 for Treatment of DR (Suprachoroidal Delivery)_\n\n  * Based on positive interim results to date from the Phase II ALTITUDE® trial, AbbVie and REGENXBIO have accelerated a planned End-of-Phase II meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expected this quarter. The Company expects to initiate the first global pivotal trial in H1 2025.\n  * The ALTITUDE trial is enrolling a new cohort of patients with center-involved diabetic macular edema (DME). DME is a vision-threatening complication of DR; an estimated 34 million people globally have DME. Patients will receive a one-time, in-office injection of ABBV-RGX-314 at dose level 4 (1.5x10e12 GC/eye) with short course prophylactic steroid eye drops.\n\n\n\n_ABBV-RGX-314 for the Treatment of Wet AMD (Subretinal Delivery)_\n\n  * Enrollment is on track in the ATMOSPHERE® and ASCENT™ pivotal trials and these trials are expected to support global regulatory submissions with the FDA and European Medicines Agency in H1 2026.\n  * Positive data from the Phase II fellow eye sub-study evaluating the subretinal delivery of ABBV-RGX-314 in patients with bilateral wet AMD were recently presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology annual meeting. As of September 11, 2024, ABBV-RGX-314 was well tolerated in the treated fellow eye, with no drug-related serious adverse events and no cases of intraocular inflammation observed. At nine months post-administration, patients saw a 97% reduction in anti-VEGF treatment burden and sustained vision and anatomy. These results support the potential of ABBV-RGX-314 to treat bilateral disease at an expected commercial launch.\n\n\n\n_ABBV-RGX-314 for the Treatment of Wet AMD (Suprachoroidal Delivery_)\n\n  * Based on a favorable safety profile and to evaluate dose levels for a planned pivotal program, the Phase II AAVIATE® trial is enrolling a new cohort to evaluate ABBV-RGX-314 at dose level 4 (1.5x10e12 GC/eye). Patients in this cohort will also receive short course prophylactic steroid eye drops. At dose level 3, patients receiving ABBV-RGX-314 demonstrated an 80% reduction in annualized injection rate, with 50% of patients remaining injection-free at six months. Patients also demonstrated stable Best Corrected Visual Acuity and central retinal thickness.\n\n\n\n**Neurodegenerative Disease:** RGX-121 is a potential first-in-class treatment for MPS II.\n\n  * REGENXBIO initiated a rolling BLA submission for RGX-121 using the accelerated approval pathway in Q3 2024. The BLA submission is expected to be complete in Q1 2025.\n  * RGX-121 is on track to be the potential first gene therapy and one-time treatment approved for MPS II. Approval of RGX-121 could result in receipt of a Priority Review Voucher in 2025.\n\n\n\n**FINANCIAL RESULTS** _Cash Position:_ Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $278.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $314.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by cash used to fund operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and was partially offset by $131.1 million of aggregate net proceeds received from the follow-on public offering of the Company's common stock and pre-funded warrants completed in March 2024.\n\n_Revenues:_ Revenues were $24.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $28.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to Zolgensma royalty revenues, which decreased from $28.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 to $23.9 million for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n_Research and Development Expenses_ : Research and development expenses were $54.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $58.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was largely driven by lower personnel-related costs and early-stage research and development activities, and was partially offset by increases in clinical trial expenses for ABBV-RGX-314 and RGX-202.\n\n_General and Administrative Expenses_ : General and administrative expenses were $19.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to expenses for professional services and other corporate overhead costs.\n\n_Net Loss_ : Net loss was $59.6 million, or $1.17 basic and diluted net loss per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $61.9 million, or $1.41 basic and diluted net loss per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**FINANCIAL GUIDANCE** REGENXBIO expects its balance in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $278.6 million as of September 30, 2024 to fund its operations into 2026. This cash runway guidance is based on the Company's current operational plans and excludes the impact of any material payments that may potentially be received from partners or licensees upon the achievement of development or regulatory milestones, or upon the approval or commercialization of product candidates.\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL** In connection with this announcement, REGENXBIO will host a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. ET.
