(Nasdaq:JOUT)**, a leading global innovator of outdoor recreation equipment and technology, today announced operating results for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2024.\n\n“Challenging marketplace conditions and competitive pressures resulted in lower sales and an operating loss for our 2024 fiscal year. In this challenging environment, we invested in resources against our strategic priorities while working hard to drive operational cost savings,” said Helen Johnson-Leipold, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Looking ahead, while market and competitive pressures will remain in the near-term, we will focus on strong consumer-driven innovation, enhancing our go-to-market strategy, and improving operational efficiencies. We are confident these are the right things to deliver long-term profitable growth.”\n\n**FISCAL 2024 RESULTS** Total Company revenue fell 11 percent to $592.8 million versus fiscal 2023 revenue of $663.8 million as market challenges and competitive pressures resulted in weaker demand and sales across all segments.\n\n  * In Fishing, due to a tough marine market and competitive dynamics, revenue decreased 8 percent\n  * Diving sales were down 13 percent, driven by softening market demand across all geographic regions\n  * Camping revenue decreased 17 percent due primarily to general declines in market demand as well as $4.5 million in revenue from the prior year to Military and Commercial Tents product lines, which were previously divested\n  * Watercraft Recreation sales were down 29 percent due to continuing decreased demand in the overall watercraft market compared to the prior year\n\n\n\nTotal Company operating loss was ($43.5 million) in fiscal 2024, which compared unfavorably to operating profit of $11.7 million in the prior fiscal year. Gross margin decreased to 33.9 percent in fiscal 2024, compared to 36.8 percent in the prior year. Cost savings initiatives were more than offset by unfavorable absorption of fixed overhead costs driven by lower sales volumes, as well as changes in product mix toward lower margin products. \n\nOperating expenses increased from the prior year by $12.2 million due primarily to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $11.2 million recognized in the Fishing segment during the fourth quarter, increased bad debt reserves of $2.5 million, and increased severance costs of $1.5 million. Additionally, $3.8 million of higher deferred compensation expense as a result of marking plan assets to market value further drove the increase in operating expenses and was entirely offset in Other income. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation and professional services expenses between years. \n\nLoss before income taxes was ($29.9 million) in fiscal 2024, compared to profit before taxes of $25.8 million in fiscal 2023. In addition to the change in operating profit, Other income decreased slightly from $9.7 million in the prior year to $9.0 million in the current year. Net investment gains and earnings on the assets related to the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which are included in Other income, improved by $3.8 million over the prior year quarter, which fully offset the increase in deferred compensation expense in operating expenses above. This increase was more than offset by the net effect of a gain of approximately $6.6 million related to the divestiture of the Military and Commercial Tents product lines in the Camping Segment in the prior year, and a gain of approximately $1.9 million on the sale of a building in the current year-to-date period.\n\nNet loss for the fiscal year fell to ($26.5 million), or ($2.60) per diluted share, versus net income of $19.5 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, in the last fiscal year. The effective tax rate was 11.1 percent compared to the previous fiscal year’s rate of 24.4 percent.\n\n**FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS** Total Company net sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $105.9 million, an increase of $9.5 million from the prior fiscal year fourth quarter’s sales. Operating loss of ($42.8 million) in the current year fourth quarter compared unfavorably to a loss of ($22.6 million) in the prior year fourth quarter. Gross margin declined as a result of increased promotional pricing, changes in product mix toward lower margin products, and inventory reserves on slow-moving and obsolete inventory. Operating expenses increased due primarily to the goodwill write-off discussed above. Loss before income taxes was ($39.7 million) in the current year quarter, compared to a loss of ($22.1 million) in the prior year fourth quarter. Net loss for the fourth quarter was ($34.3 million) compared to a loss of ($16.0 million) in fiscal 2023.\n\n**OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION** The Company reported cash and investments of $162.0 million as of September 27, 2024, a $9.5 million increase from the prior year, with no debt on its balance sheet. Depreciation and amortization were $19.6 million compared to $16.3 million in fiscal 2023. Capital spending totaled $22.0 million in fiscal 2024 compared with $22.7 million in fiscal 2023. In September 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of record as of October 11, 2024, which was payable on October 25, 2024.\n\n“In fiscal 2024, despite the operating loss, we drove positive cash flow from operations through prudent inventory management. Additionally, we focused on operational cost savings and efficiencies to mitigate impacts from challenging market dynamics. We will strategically manage costs in fiscal 2025 while at the same time making investments to strengthen the business. Our balance sheet remains debt-free and we remain confident in our ability and plans to create long-term value and consistently pay dividends to shareholders,” said David W. Johnson, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**WEBCAST** The Company will host a conference call and audio web cast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, December 10, 2024.
