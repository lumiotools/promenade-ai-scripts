(Nasdaq:ERII) (“Energy Recovery” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $38.6 million, reaching the upper end of our guidance of $35 - $39 million. \n  * Gross margin of 65.1%, a decrease of 480 bps, as compared to Q3’2023, due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and higher costs related to product mix. \n  * Operating expenses of $18.1 million, an increase of 7.8%, as compared to Q3’2023, due primarily to higher consulting costs related to enhancement of our corporate growth strategy and higher employee costs. \n  * Income from operations of $7.1 million, a decrease of 22.7%, as compared to Q3’2023, mainly due to higher operating expenses and lower gross margin. \n  * Net income of $8.5 million and adjusted EBITDA(1) of $11.6 million. \n  * Cash and investments of $139.9 million, which include cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term investments. \n\n\n\nDavid Moon, President and CEO, commented on the financial results, “We delivered strong third quarter results, hitting the upper end of our guidance for the quarter and, although there is still work to be done, we believe we are well-positioned in this quarter to deliver on our guidance for the full year. Our core desalination business continues to demonstrate durability of growth, our wastewater business continues to expand, and we are making real progress this year in our CO2 refrigeration business.” \n\nMr. Moon continued, “With our PX G1300 summer data collection complete, we just issued a white paper with the measurement and verification results, provided by a third party engineering firm, that we believe will be an important next step to getting the PX G1300 integrated into OEM systems designs and ultimately specified by supermarkets. Finally, we concluded our strategic work on what I have termed our Playbook. This Playbook outlines our five-year plan to grow all three of Energy Recovery’s businesses. It is an ambitious and I believe achievable blueprint for growth that I, along with Mike Mancini, CFO, and our business unit leads, are excited to lay out next month on a live investor webinar we are hosting on November 18, 2024.” \n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n**Quarter-to-Date** |  **Year to Date**  \n---|---  \n**Q3’2024** |  **Q3’2023** |  **vs. Q3’2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024 vs. 2023**  \n_(In millions, except net income (loss) per share, percentages and basis points)_  \nRevenue  |  $38.6  |  $37.0  |  up 4%  |  $77.9  |  $71.2  |  up 9%   \nGross margin  |  65.1%  |  69.9%  |  down 480 bps  |  64.0%  |  66.9%  |  down 290 bps   \nOperating margin  |  18.3%  |  24.7%  |  down 640 bps  |  (7.6%)  |  (2.2%)  |  down 540 bps   \nNet income (loss)  |  $8.5  |  $9.7  |  down 12%  |  ($0.4)  |  $1.7  |  down 125%   \nNet income (loss) per share  |  $0.15  |  $0.17  |  down $0.02  |  ($0.01)  |  $0.03  |  down $0.04   \nEffective tax rate  |  62.4%  |  (114.2%)   \nCash provided by (used for) operations  |  ($3.0)  |  $7.7  |  $11.6  |  $12.3   \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Highlights(1)**\n\n**Quarter-to-Date** |  **Year to Date**  \n---|---  \n**Q3’2024** |  **Q3’2023** |  **vs. Q3’2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024 vs. 2023**  \n_(In millions, except adjusted net income per share, percentages and basis points)_  \nAdjusted operating margin  |  27.5%  |  29.5%  |  down 200 bps  |  9.7%  |  6.0%  |  up 370 bps   \nAdjusted net income  |  $12.0  |  $11.4  |  up 5%  |  $12.4  |  $6.8  |  up 81%   \nAdjusted net income per share  |  $0.21  |  $0.20  |  up $0.01  |  $0.22  |  $0.12  |  up $0.10   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $11.6  |  $12.0  |  $10.6  |  $7.3   \nFree cash flow  |  ($3.2)  |  $7.4  |  $10.4  |  $11.1   \n  \n___________  \n---  \n(1) |  Refer to the sections “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts, respectively.   \n  \n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain matters discussed in this press release and on the conference call are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the belief that the Company is well-positioned in the fourth quarter to deliver on our guidance for the full year, the belief that the Company is making real progress this year in its CO2 refrigeration business, the belief that the Company’s recently published white paper is an important next step to getting the PX G1300 integrated into original equipment manufacturers’ systems designs and ultimately specified by supermarkets, and the belief that the Company’s Playbook is an achievable blueprint for growth. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to the Company and on management’s beliefs, assumptions, estimates, or projections and are not guarantees of future events or results. Potential risks and uncertainties include risks relating to the future demand for the Company’s products, risks relating to performance by our customers and third-party partners, risks relating to the timing of revenue, and any other factors that may have been discussed herein regarding the risks and uncertainties of the Company’s business, and the risks discussed under “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as other reports filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time. Because such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company’s actual results may differ materially from the predictions in these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the Company assumes no obligation to update such statements. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same captions, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business. \n\n**Notes to the Financial Results**\n\n  * _Adjusted operating margin_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as income (loss) from operations which excludes i) share-based compensation; and ii) executive transition costs, such as executive search costs, retention costs, one-time severance costs and one-time corporate growth strategy costs, divided by revenues. \n  * _Adjusted net income_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income which excludes i) share-based compensation; ii) executive transition costs; and iii) the applicable tax effect of the excluded items including the share-based compensation discrete tax item. \n  * _Adjusted net income per share_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income (loss), which excludes i) share-based compensation; ii) executive transition costs and iii) the applicable tax effect of the excluded items including the share-based compensation discrete tax item, divided by basic shares outstanding. \n  * _Adjusted EBITDA_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income (loss) which excludes i) depreciation and amortization; ii) share-based compensation; iii) executive transition costs; iv) other income, net, such as interest income and other non-operating income (expense), net; and v) provision for (benefit from) income taxes. \n  * _Free cash flow_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call to Discuss Financial Results**\n\nLIVE CONFERENCE CALL: Wednesday, October 30, 2024, 2:00 PM PT / 5:00 PM ET US / Canada Toll-Free: +1 (866) 682-6100 Local / International Toll: +1 (862) 298-0702 \n\nCONFERENCE CALL REPLAY: Available approximately three hours after conclusion of the live call.

(Nasdaq: ERII) today announced new performance data for the PX G1300® pressure exchanger. The findings demonstrate its successful integration into several existing CO2 refrigeration systems to reduce energy consumption and increase cooling capacity and system stability.\n\nCO2 refrigeration is a leading replacement for harmful hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) systems because it is non-toxic, non-flammable, and has a low global warming potential thousands of times better than HFCs. While CO2 systems consume less energy than typical HFC systems1, their efficiency declines in hot weather, leading to higher electricity costs in the summer. Many current solutions leverage water to keep up system efficiency in the heat, which creates challenges of water cost, availability, and maintenance. Additionally, refrigeration systems operate within a fixed capacity (design temperature), causing strain during heat waves and potentially leading to system failure.\n\nResults from this release show that the PX G1300 can aid in solving all three problems by increasing energy efficiency and cooling capacity without water. Findings showed the PX G1300 improved the leading metric of energy efficiency (coefficient of performance) by peaks of up to 30% with as much as 15% in projected annual energy savings2. In addition to energy efficiency, findings estimate the PX G1300 increases cooling capacity for CO2 refrigeration systems by up to 15% at 95°F (35°C)2, providing operational flexibility to safeguard against heatwaves.\n\n“Our goal at Energy Recovery is to support the global transition from harmful hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) to sustainable, low global warming refrigerants,” said Ricardo Freitas, Energy Recovery’s Vice President of CO2. “With the PX G1300, our customers experience not only year-round energy savings, they also benefit from enhanced system capacity to provide peace of mind from heat waves and a rapidly warming climate.”\n\nThe PX G1300 is an innovative application of our leading PX® Pressure Exchanger® for desalination that offers a simple and cost-effective energy saving solution for CO2 refrigeration, easing the transition to sustainable refrigeration.\n\nRead full white paper [here](https://energyrecovery.com/resources/field-experience-of-px-g1300-pressure-exchanger-in-commercial-co2-refrigeration-systems-performance-measurement-validation/ \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain matters discussed in this press release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including our belief that the PX G1300 can improve COP by peaks of up to 30%, our belief that the PX G1300 can lead to as much as 15% in projected annual energy savings, and our belief that the PX G1300 can increase cooling capacity for CO2 refrigeration systems by up to 15%.

(Nasdaq:ERII) (“Energy Recovery” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $38.6 million, reaching the upper end of our guidance of $35 - $39 million. \n  * Gross margin of 65.1%, a decrease of 480 bps, as compared to Q3’2023, due primarily to higher manufacturing costs and higher costs related to product mix. \n  * Operating expenses of $18.1 million, an increase of 7.8%, as compared to Q3’2023, due primarily to higher consulting costs related to enhancement of our corporate growth strategy and higher employee costs. \n  * Income from operations of $7.1 million, a decrease of 22.7%, as compared to Q3’2023, mainly due to higher operating expenses and lower gross margin. \n  * Net income of $8.5 million and adjusted EBITDA(1) of $11.6 million. \n  * Cash and investments of $139.9 million, which include cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term investments. \n\n\n\nDavid Moon, President and CEO, commented on the financial results, “We delivered strong third quarter results, hitting the upper end of our guidance for the quarter and, although there is still work to be done, we believe we are well-positioned in this quarter to deliver on our guidance for the full year. Our core desalination business continues to demonstrate durability of growth, our wastewater business continues to expand, and we are making real progress this year in our CO2 refrigeration business.” \n\nMr. Moon continued, “With our PX G1300 summer data collection complete, we just issued a white paper with the measurement and verification results, provided by a third party engineering firm, that we believe will be an important next step to getting the PX G1300 integrated into OEM systems designs and ultimately specified by supermarkets. Finally, we concluded our strategic work on what I have termed our Playbook. This Playbook outlines our five-year plan to grow all three of Energy Recovery’s businesses. It is an ambitious and I believe achievable blueprint for growth that I, along with Mike Mancini, CFO, and our business unit leads, are excited to lay out next month on a live investor webinar we are hosting on November 18, 2024.” \n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n**Quarter-to-Date** |  **Year to Date**  \n---|---  \n**Q3’2024** |  **Q3’2023** |  **vs. Q3’2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024 vs. 2023**  \n_(In millions, except net income (loss) per share, percentages and basis points)_  \nRevenue  |  $38.6  |  $37.0  |  up 4%  |  $77.9  |  $71.2  |  up 9%   \nGross margin  |  65.1%  |  69.9%  |  down 480 bps  |  64.0%  |  66.9%  |  down 290 bps   \nOperating margin  |  18.3%  |  24.7%  |  down 640 bps  |  (7.6%)  |  (2.2%)  |  down 540 bps   \nNet income (loss)  |  $8.5  |  $9.7  |  down 12%  |  ($0.4)  |  $1.7  |  down 125%   \nNet income (loss) per share  |  $0.15  |  $0.17  |  down $0.02  |  ($0.01)  |  $0.03  |  down $0.04   \nEffective tax rate  |  62.4%  |  (114.2%)   \nCash provided by (used for) operations  |  ($3.0)  |  $7.7  |  $11.6  |  $12.3   \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Highlights(1)**\n\n**Quarter-to-Date** |  **Year to Date**  \n---|---  \n**Q3’2024** |  **Q3’2023** |  **vs. Q3’2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024 vs. 2023**  \n_(In millions, except adjusted net income per share, percentages and basis points)_  \nAdjusted operating margin  |  27.5%  |  29.5%  |  down 200 bps  |  9.7%  |  6.0%  |  up 370 bps   \nAdjusted net income  |  $12.0  |  $11.4  |  up 5%  |  $12.4  |  $6.8  |  up 81%   \nAdjusted net income per share  |  $0.21  |  $0.20  |  up $0.01  |  $0.22  |  $0.12  |  up $0.10   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $11.6  |  $12.0  |  $10.6  |  $7.3   \nFree cash flow  |  ($3.2)  |  $7.4  |  $10.4  |  $11.1   \n  \n___________  \n---  \n(1) |  Refer to the sections “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts, respectively.   \n  \n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain matters discussed in this press release and on the conference call are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including the belief that the Company is well-positioned in the fourth quarter to deliver on our guidance for the full year, the belief that the Company is making real progress this year in its CO2 refrigeration business, the belief that the Company’s recently published white paper is an important next step to getting the PX G1300 integrated into original equipment manufacturers’ systems designs and ultimately specified by supermarkets, and the belief that the Company’s Playbook is an achievable blueprint for growth. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to the Company and on management’s beliefs, assumptions, estimates, or projections and are not guarantees of future events or results. Potential risks and uncertainties include risks relating to the future demand for the Company’s products, risks relating to performance by our customers and third-party partners, risks relating to the timing of revenue, and any other factors that may have been discussed herein regarding the risks and uncertainties of the Company’s business, and the risks discussed under “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as other reports filed by the Company with the SEC from time to time. Because such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the Company’s actual results may differ materially from the predictions in these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the Company assumes no obligation to update such statements. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position, or cash flows that either exclude or include amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same captions, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business. \n\n**Notes to the Financial Results**\n\n  * _Adjusted operating margin_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as income (loss) from operations which excludes i) share-based compensation; and ii) executive transition costs, such as executive search costs, retention costs, one-time severance costs and one-time corporate growth strategy costs, divided by revenues. \n  * _Adjusted net income_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income which excludes i) share-based compensation; ii) executive transition costs; and iii) the applicable tax effect of the excluded items including the share-based compensation discrete tax item. \n  * _Adjusted net income per share_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income (loss), which excludes i) share-based compensation; ii) executive transition costs and iii) the applicable tax effect of the excluded items including the share-based compensation discrete tax item, divided by basic shares outstanding. \n  * _Adjusted EBITDA_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income (loss) which excludes i) depreciation and amortization; ii) share-based compensation; iii) executive transition costs; iv) other income, net, such as interest income and other non-operating income (expense), net; and v) provision for (benefit from) income taxes. \n  * _Free cash flow_ is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call to Discuss Financial Results**\n\nLIVE CONFERENCE CALL: Wednesday, October 30, 2024, 2:00 PM PT / 5:00 PM ET US / Canada Toll-Free: +1 (866) 682-6100 Local / International Toll: +1 (862) 298-0702 \n\nCONFERENCE CALL REPLAY: Available approximately three hours after conclusion of the live call.

Welcome to Energy Recovery's 2024 third quarter\nearnings conference call. We appreciate your joining us. I am Lionel McBee, Director of\nInvestor Relations at Energy Recovery and I am joined by our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer, David Moon, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Mancini.\nThe prerecorded remarks from today’s call are available on the Investors section\nof our website and are meant to accompany the third-quarter earnings news release,\nwhich is posted in the same location.\nDuring today's call, we may make projections and other forward-looking\nstatements under the Safe Harbor provisions contained in the Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995 regarding future events or the future financial performance of the\nCompany.

I want to\nsay how grateful I am for Mike’s partnership and the work he has already done. As I\nmentioned last quarter, Mike brings a wealth of experience in high-growth engineering\nand technology companies. He has had executive leadership roles in finance, where he\ndemonstrated his ability to drive financial strategy and performance across the entire\nenterprise. Additionally, his background with the institutional investment community\nprovides him with a deep understanding of capital markets, which makes him a valuable\nasset to our leadership team. Before I get into the third quarter financial results, I will\nmake a brief comment on our strategic planning process, or the Playbook as we call it.\nAlthough we won’t be getting into any of the specifics of the Playbook on this call, we are\nhosting a live investor webinar on November 18th, where members of my senior\nleadership team will present our Playbook including growth plans for Desalination,\nWastewater, and CO2. We will also roll out our guidance for 2025 and 2026, as well as\nprovide long-term 2029 financial targets. The webinar will take place at 10 a.m. Eastern\nTime and will last approximately two hours, including a live Q&A session.\nThe event will be accessible virtually via the link located on the IR Calendar section\nof Energy Recovery’s IR website, and a replay of the event will also be archived there.\nAdditional details can be found in our press release issued on October 21st.\nNow, let us move to the third quarter update.\n2\nSummary – David Moon\nFirst, let me start by saying thank you to our employees for helping to deliver\nanother very solid quarter. The third quarter was strong. With total revenue of $38.6 million,\nwe achieved the upper end of our guidance for the quarter and set another quarterly\nrevenue record. While we still have considerable work to do to deliver what stands to be\nthe largest quarter in the company’s history in the fourth quarter, our third quarter\nperformance did create a line of sight to achievement of our full-year guidance of $140 to\n$150 million.\nAs I have said the last couple of quarters, the demands on the team to deliver on\nsome of these mega projects are only increasing. With that said, I remain confident in\nour ability to deliver what will be the biggest quarter in Energy Recovery’s history, capping\noff what will be the eleventh consecutive year of revenue growth and another year of\ndominant market share in our mega projects channel.\nLet me talk briefly about our high-level segment results before turning it over to\nMike for the financial details.\nWater – David Moon\nBeginning with our Water business, Water revenue came in at $38.3 million, an\nincrease of 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023 and up 42% when compared to the\nsecond quarter of 2024. This reflects the high end of our guidance for the third quarter of\n$35 to $39 million and continues the prior quarter’s solid growth in mega projects. Results\nwere driven by continued, strong demand in the Middle East and North Africa region, as\nwell as demand from India.\nI’d like to highlight several notable desal shipments made during the quarter.\nFirst, we completed the second and final shipment of the Perur project in Chennai,\nIndia, worth $4.1 million, as we mentioned previously during our July earnings call. Once\nconstructed, this will be the largest desalination plant in India delivering 400,000 cubic\nmeters per day.\n3\nAlso, as a reminder, the Perur project in Chennai, India, was just one of the projects\nincluded in the $15 million in contracts that we announced in July for several SWRO\ndesalination plants in India. For the remaining four projects under these contracts, we\nshipped $8.3 million and expect to complete the additional $2.6 million of shipments in\nthe fourth quarter. All together, these plants will provide over 670,000 cubic meters of\nclean drinking water to communities in India each day.\nWe also made progress on the Hassyan IPP project in Dubai, UAE during the third\nquarter, which once constructed will be the largest desalination plant in Dubai providing\n820,000 cubic meters per day. As of our last earnings call in July, we had shipped the first\nphase. As of today, I’m pleased to report that we shipped a total of $10.5 million year-to-\ndate and expect to ship an additional $5.3 million in Q4.\nIn addition to these shipments, we also continued to secure major desalination contracts\nin recent months.\nIn August, we signed contracts totaling $27.5 million for SWRO desalination\nprojects in Morocco. These projects will supply over one million cubic meters per day of\npotable water for municipal and agricultural use, which represents enough water for more\nthan 600,000 Moroccans. As of today, we have shipped $12.3 million of the total order.\nThe balance of the order is currently expected to be fulfilled in 2024, however we are\nclosely monitoring this timing, given an end-of-December target shipping date. North\nAfrica continues to be an important driver of growth for our water business, with secular\ntrends such as ongoing drought, industrial growth, and population growth continuing to\ngenerate strong demand for SWRO desalination plants.\nEarlier this month, we announced contract awards totaling over $12 million for\nthree SWRO desalination projects in the United Arab Emirates. The plants include\ncapacity totaling close to one million cubic meters per day, and as a proof point as to the\nmanufacturing improvements we have made, our intent is to ship nearly all of these orders\nhere in the fourth quarter.\nBoth contract awards, and their shipment dates, were on our radar and therefore\nincluded in our financial guidance for 2024.\n4\nBased on our strong third quarter results and our expectations for additional\nshipments in the fourth quarter, we are maintaining our revenue guidance of $140 to $150\nmillion for the year.\nAs we have provided in previous quarters, our current 2024 total Water revenue\nas of the end of the third quarter, which includes revenue recognized in the first nine\nmonths of the year and signed projects under contract yet to be delivered, totals\napproximately $137 million or 94% of the midpoint of our guided range for 2024. This\ncompares to roughly $136 million, or 100% of the guided range at the same time in 2023.\nWhile this substantial progress toward our full year guidance underpins our\nconfidence in reaffirming our guided range for the full year, we cannot control customer-\ndriven delays or slippage. With that said, we continue to collaborate closely with our\ncustomers, and we remain focused on strong execution in the fourth quarter to complete\nour remaining shipments and to deliver our full year guidance. In the event unforeseen\ncircumstances cause slippage toward the end of the year, however, I’d like to reiterate\nthat the associated revenue would not be at risk but would simply be recognized in 2025\nrather than the fourth quarter of 2024.\nTurning to wastewater, our wastewater pipeline continues to grow, and we have\nincreased our signed wastewater contracts by almost 46% as compared to last year\nduring the same period. Our strategic diversification strategy for wastewater is\nunderway, and we are making progress on our product portfolio expansion. For the full\nyear, we expect to generate revenue toward the lower-end of our previously provided\nguidance range of $12 to $15 million. This is primarily the result of a wastewater mega\nproject, the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia that has transitioned to a longer-term, phased\nproject over multiple years. However, we expect to offset this impact through continued\noutperformance that we are seeing in the OEM channel. We will share more details on\nour progress and strategy for Wastewater during our investor webinar on November\n18th.\nOverall, we feel that the air pocket created by rapidly rising interest rates,\ninflationary effects, and concerns around global economic activity have begun to\n5\nmoderate. Clearly, there are still economic and geopolitical concerns around the globe,\nbut the long-term trends for fresh water demand remain intact, and we continue to see\nsolid growth ahead.\nNow let’s move to our CO2 business.\nCO2 – David Moon\nWe continue to make progress in the development and commercialization of our\nsecond generation PX G. As I stated during our last call, in the second quarter we\ncompleted our first gating item for 2024, which was the successful completion of lab\ntesting. During the third quarter, we turned our focus to our second gating item, which is\nthe installation of 30 to 50 sites by the end of Q4 2024.\nI’m pleased to report that we reached our initial goal of having at least 10 sites\ninstalled and operating across the US and Europe. In fact, we have now completed the\ninstallation of a total of 11 sites year-to-date.\nWith the site goal reached, we were able to complete the collection of critical\nsummer data. As I discussed during our last call, we partnered with DC Engineering, a\nhighly respected third-party engineering firm, to measure and verify energy savings\nprovided by our second generation PX G at six of the ten initial sites.\nI’m pleased to report that in collaboration with DC Engineering, we recently\npublished the white paper on these results, which we believe will be the catalyst for our\nOEM partners and for us to accelerate PX G adoption with end users in the near-term.\nThe full white paper can be found on our website, but the results were better than\nexpected, showing that the PX G reduces energy consumption, increases cooling\ncapacity, and improves system stability.\nThe findings showed that the PX G improved the leading metric of energy efficiency,\nthe coefficient of performance, by peaks of up to 30% with as much as 15% in projected\nannual energy savings. In addition to energy efficiency, findings estimate the PX G\nincreases cooling capacity for CO2 refrigeration systems by up to 15% at 95°F, or 35°C,\nproviding operational flexibility to safeguard against heatwaves. Based on the success of\n6\nthe ongoing measurement and verification processes, during the third quarter multiple\nOEMs began the process of integrating the PX G into their CO2 transcritical racks. This\nis a necessary and important step towards full commercialization of the PX G. We are\nhighly encouraged by the test results and the resulting integration by our OEM partners.\nAdding to our momentum, we currently have 19 additional sites to be\ncommissioned for installation in the coming months. Including the 11 sites already\ninstalled and operating, we are on a clear path toward meeting the low end our target of\n30 to 50 sites installed by the end of 2024. Additionally, our pipeline of additional sites has\ngrown meaningfully as the industry gained awareness of the PX G technology. We are in\ndiscussions with existing customers to expand installed sites and with new OEM and end-\ncustomer parties for new sites across the U.S. and Europe. Momentum for the PX G is\nclearly accelerating.\nI look forward to sharing additional details on our progress and strategy for CO2\nand wastewater during our upcoming webinar.\nWith that, I would like to hand it over to Mike to discuss our financial results for the\nquarter.\n7\nFinancial Update – Mike Mancini\nThank you, David. And, let me start by saying thanks to you and to the Board for\nyour trust and confidence in me to lead the finance function here at Energy Recovery.\nBefore arriving, I was excited about the company’s core business prospects, the exciting\nopportunities to grow and expand the reach of the PX technology, and the opportunity to\ndrive profitability and cash flow. After almost three months on the job, I am now confident\nin the company's ability to create value for its shareholders and I look forward to working\nwith the team on driving financial results.\nI’d like to begin by discussing our Revenue, Gross Margin and product mix. Then,\nI’ll discuss our Operating Expense, Net Income, and cash position, as well as our\nexpectations for the full year 2024.\nAs David mentioned we had a solid quarter of revenue, generating $38.6 million,\nat the upper end of our guidance. The project-driven, lumpy-nature, of our megaproject\nchannel has become quite evident to me even in the short time I have been here. Q4\nrevenue is expected to be between $62 million and $72 million, which will represent over\n45% of our full-year revenue at the midpoint. In the 4th quarter alone, five projects\nrepresent approximately 50% of the revenue, with a single project representing over 20%.\nAny delays in shipment dates on those projects would have an impact on our full-year\nrevenue, although there would be a minimal impact to the intrinsic value of the business\nof such delays.\nMoving to Margins. Our Gross Margin improved 50 basis points when compared\nto the second quarter of the year, with the third quarter coming in at 65.1%, above our\npreviously guided range of 62% to 64% for the third quarter. We believe we have turned\nthe corner in our efforts to manage and resolve challenges related to our ramp up in\nproduction for the Q400, and our Gross Margin expectation for the fourth quarter is 64%\nto 68%, which would put our full year Gross Margin guidance within our guided range of\n64% and 67%\nRegarding product mix, on our last call we stated that the Q400 was trending\ntowards 50% of our Water PX demand for 2024, up from our original expectation of 25%.\n8\nDuring the third quarter, the Q400 comprised approximately 45% of our Water PX demand,\nreinforcing our expectation for 50% product mix for the full year. This faster-than\nexpected-adoption of the Q400 highlights our product leadership position in the\nmegaproject desalination space and underscores our ability to align our solutions with\ncustomers’ evolving needs.\nOur Operating Expenses for the third quarter were $18.1 million, which came in below\nour previously guided range of $21 to $22 million for the quarter. One-time costs for the\nquarter were $1.1 million. As a result, Base Opex for the quarter was $17 million, a 1%\nincrease from the same period last year. So, while our focus on cost and capital efficiency\nare working, we do expect to continue to experience some one-time costs associated with\nthe work in support of our long-term growth strategy and some added employee count to\nsupport our growth. Still, we will be able to capture the benefit of our cost efforts and are\nreducing our full year Operating Expense guidance to $76 to $78 million from the previous\n$78 to $80 million, which still includes the estimated $7 million in one-time costs we have\nindicated before. This implies expected Operating Expense for the fourth quarter of\napproximately $20 to $22 million and full year 2024 Base Opex of $69 to $71 million.\nAdditionally, we reported Income from Operations for the third quarter of $7.1\nmillion, in line with our expectation provided on our last call to move to positive operating\nincome as the year progresses. We also reported Net Income for the third quarter of $8.5\nmillion, reflecting a substantial increase compared to the second quarter.\nLastly, we maintained our cash balance during the quarter, with cash and\ninvestments of $139.9 million as of the end of the third quarter compared to $138 million\nat the end of the second quarter. We remain in a very strong financial position and we\nexpect to end the year at between $140 to $150 million of cash, depending on collections.\nWith that, I’d like to turn it back over to David for a few closing remarks.\nWrap-Up – David Moon\nThank you, Mike.\nTo sum up:\n9\n- We delivered a record third quarter, and while there is still work ahead of us to\nexecute the fourth quarter, we remain confident in our full year revenue\nguidance of $140 to $150 million,\n- We remain on track to generate $12 to $15 million in revenue from our\nwastewater business, although we anticipate this will come in toward the lower\nend of the range,\n- We are on track to deliver the low end of 30 to 50 sites with our second\ngeneration PX G installed by the end of the year.We are maintaining our Gross\nMargin guidance of 64% to 67%.\n- We are reducing our Operating Expense guidance to $76 to $78 million.\nWith that, let’s move to Q&A.\n10"

wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Energy Recovery”) designs and manufactures reliable,\nhigh-performance solutions that provide cost savings through improved energy efficiency in commercial and industrial processes, with\napplications across several industries. Leveraging the Company’s pressure exchanger technology, which generates little to no emissions\nwhen operating, the Company believes its solutions lower costs, save energy, reduce waste, and minimize emissions for companies across a\nvariety of commercial and industrial processes. As the world coalesces around the urgent need to address climate change and its impacts,\nthe Company is helping companies reduce their energy consumption in their industrial processes, which in turn, reduces their carbon\nfootprint. The Company believes that its customers do not have to sacrifice quality and cost savings for sustainability and the Company is\ncommitted to developing solutions that drive long-term value – both financial and environmental. The Company’s solutions are marketed,\nsold in, and developed for, the fluid-flow and gas markets, such as seawater and wastewater desalination, natural gas, chemical processing\nand CO-based refrigeration systems, under the trademarks ERI®, PX®, Pressure Exchanger®, PX® Pressure Exchanger® (“PX”), Ultra PX™,\n2\nPX G™, PX G1300™, PX PowerTrain™, AT™, and Aquabold™.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements\nprepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules\nand regulations. The December 31, 2023 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements and may\nnot include all disclosures required by GAAP; however, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information\npresented not misleading.\nThe September 30, 2024 unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024 (the “2023 Annual Report”).\nThe results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any\nfuture periods.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified in certain notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to conform\nto the current period presentation.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 6\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires the Company’s management to\nmake judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and\naccompanying notes.\nThe accounting policies that reflect the Company’s significant estimates and judgments and that the Company believes are the most\ncritical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results are revenue recognition; granted equity award valuations;\nequipment useful life and valuation; goodwill valuation and impairment; deferred taxes and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets; and\nevaluation and measurement of contingencies. Those estimates could change, and as a result, actual results could differ materially from\nthose estimates.\nThe Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a\nrevision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of October 30, 2024, the date of issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThese estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update these estimates for any\nreason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, except as required by law.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies in Note 1, “Description of Business and\nSignificant Accounting Policies - Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8,\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of the 2023 Annual Report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted\nThere have been no issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 that apply to the Company other than the pronouncements disclosed in Note 1, “Description of Business and Significant\nAccounting Policies - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of the 2023 Annual Report.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 7\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 2 — Revenue\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following tables present the disaggregated revenues by segment, and within each segment, by geographical market based on the\ncustomer “shipped to” address, and by channel customers.

The Company monitors the industries in which it operates and reviews its business performance for indicators of potential\nimpairment. The recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level, which represents the operating segment. The carrying\namount of goodwill as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $12.8 million.\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using the discounted cash flow approach and market\napproach. The forecast of future cash flows, which is based on the Company’s best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, is\nbased primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment, and general economic conditions. The Company incorporates\nother significant inputs to its fair value calculations, including discount rate and market multiples, to reflect current market conditions. As a\nresult, the analysis performed indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit, that is allocated goodwill, significantly exceeds its carrying\nvalue, and therefore, no impairment charges were recorded.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 11\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nAccrued Expenses and Other Liabilities\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities, current\nPayroll, incentives and commissions payable $ 7,134 $ 11,037\nWarranty reserve 983 1,057\nOther accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,407 3,489\nTotal accrued expenses and other liabilities 10,524 15,583\nOther liabilities, non-current 100 207\nTotal accrued expenses, and current and non-current other liabilities $ 10,624 $ 15,790\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 12\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 5 — Investments and Fair Value Measurements\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following table presents the Company’s financial assets measured on a recurring basis by contractual maturity, including pricing\ncategory, amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value.

The Company considers all claims, if any, on a quarterly basis and, based on known facts, assesses whether potential losses\nare considered reasonably possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, the Company then evaluates disclosure\nrequirements and whether to accrue for such claims in its consolidated financial statements. The Company records a provision for a liability\nwhen it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are\nreviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other\ninformation and events pertaining to a particular case. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was not involved in any lawsuits, legal\nproceedings or claims that would have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective\ntax rate, and if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a cumulative adjustment in such period. The\nCompany’s quarterly tax provision and estimate of its annual effective tax rate are subject to variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in accurately predicting its pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, the applicability of special tax\nregimes, and changes in how the Company does business.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the recognized provision for and (benefit from) income taxes, respectively,\nresulted from the tax projection based on the full year forecasted profit and included benefits related to the U.S. federal foreign-derived\nintangible income (“FDII”), federal research and development (“R&D”) tax credit, certain permanent differences, such as share-based\ncompensation shortfalls, and partial release of California valuation allowance.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the recognized provision for and (benefit from) income taxes, respectively,\nincluded benefits related to the U.S. FDII and federal R&D tax credit, along with a discrete tax benefit due primarily to share-based\ncompensation windfalls and prior years’ discrete tax benefit largely related to increased tax credits.\nThe effective tax rate excluding discrete items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year, differed\nprimarily due to lower projected R&D tax credits, increased non-deductible officer share-based compensation, and lower projected U.S. FDII\nbenefits.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 17\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 9 — Segment Reporting\nThe Company’s Chief Operating Decision-Maker (“CODM”) is its President and Chief Executive Officer.

(the “Company”, “Energy Recovery”, “we”, “our” and “us”) designs and manufactures solutions that make\nindustrial processes more efficient and sustainable. Leveraging our pressure exchanger technology, which generates little to no emissions\nwhen operating, we believe our solutions lower costs, save energy, reduce waste, and minimize emissions for companies across a variety of\ncommercial and industrial processes. As the world coalesces around the urgent need to address climate change and its impacts, we are\nhelping companies reduce their energy consumption in their industrial processes, which in turn, reduces their carbon footprint. We believe\nthat our customers do not have to sacrifice quality and cost savings for sustainability and we are committed to developing solutions that drive\nlong-term value – both financial and environmental.\nThe original product application of our technology, the PX® Pressure Exchanger® (“PX”) energy recovery device, was a major\ncontributor to the advancement of seawater reverse osmosis desalination (“SWRO”), significantly lowering the energy intensity and cost of\nwater production globally from SWRO. Our pressure exchanger technology is being applied to the wastewater filtration market, such as\nbattery manufacturers, mining operations, municipalities, and other manufacturing plants that discharge wastewater with significant levels of\nmetals and pollutants, and has also been applied to the development of our PX G1300® for use in the CO market.\n2\nEngineering, and research and development (“R&D”), have been, and remain, an essential part of our history, culture and corporate\nstrategy. Since our formation, we have developed leading technology and engineering expertise through the continual evolution of our\npressure exchanger technology, which can enhance environmental sustainability and improve productivity by reducing waste and energy\nconsumption in high-pressure industrial fluid-flow systems. This versatile technology works as a platform to build product applications and is\nat the heart of many of our products. In addition, we have engineered and developed ancillary devices, such as our hydraulic turbochargers\nand circulation “booster” pumps, that complement our energy recovery devices.\nSegments\nOur reportable operating segments consist of the water and emerging technologies segments. These segments are based on the\nindustries in which the technology solutions are sold, the type of energy recovery device or other technology sold and the related solution and\nservice or, in the case of emerging technologies, where revenues from new and/or potential devices utilizing our pressure exchanger\ntechnology can be brought to market. Other factors for determining the reportable operating segments include the manner in which our Chief\nOperating Decision Maker (“CODM”), our President and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates our performance combined with the nature of the\nindividual business activities. In addition, our corporate operating expenses include expenditures in support of the water and emerging\ntechnologies segments. We continue to monitor and review our segment reporting structure in accordance with authoritative guidance to\ndetermine whether any changes have occurred that would impact our reportable segments.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 20\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, is presented below.\nRevenue\nVariability in revenue from quarter to quarter is typical, therefore year-on-year comparisons are not necessarily indicative of the trend\nfor the full year due to these variations. There is no specific seasonality in our revenues to highlight that occurs throughout a calendar year.\nWe generally track our revenues by channels. The channels we recognize and channel definitions we utilize are as follows:\n• Megaproject (“MPD”) channel: The MPD channel has been the main driver of our long-term growth as revenue from this channel\nbenefits from a growing number of projects as well as an increase in the capacity of these projects in some cases. MPD projects\nare large-scale in nature and generally have shipment timelines from 16 to 36 months from contract date. Recognition of\nrevenue is dependent on customers’ project timing and execution of these projects.\n• Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) channel: The OEM channel reflects sales to a wide variety of industries in the\ndesalination, wastewater, and the refrigeration markets. This channel contains projects smaller in size and revenue, and of\nshorter duration compared to those projects in the MPD channel.\n• Aftermarket (“AM”) channel: The AM channel represents support and services rendered to our installed customer base. AM\nrevenue generally fluctuates from year-to-year and is dependent on our customers’ timing of product upgrades, as well as their\nreplenishment of spare parts and supplies.\nRevenue by Channel Customers\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n% of % of\nRevenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Change\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nMegaproject $ 29,009 75 % $ 26,829 73 % $ 2,180 8%\nOriginal equipment manufacturer 4,919 13 % 5,307 14 % (388) (7%)\nAftermarket 4,656 12 % 4,900 13 % (244) (5%)\nTotal revenue $ 38,584 100 % $ 37,036 100 % $ 1,548 4%\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n% of % of\nRevenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Change\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nMegaproject $ 48,924 63% $ 42,283 59% $ 6,641 16%\nOriginal equipment manufacturer 15,210 19% 16,845 24% (1,635) (10%)\nAftermarket 13,739 18% 12,032 17% 1,707 14%\nTotal revenue $ 77,873 100% $ 71,160 100% $ 6,713 9%\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 21\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Attributable to Primary Geographical Markets by Segments\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nEmerging Emerging\nWater Technologies Total Water Technologies Total\n(In thousands)\nMiddle East and Africa $ 28,043 $ 153 $ 28,196 $ 24,543 $ — $ 24,543\nAsia 6,829 — 6,829 5,688 — 5,688\nAmericas 1,051 — 1,051 5,091 123 5,214\nEurope 2,421 87 2,508 1,490 101 1,591\nTotal revenue $ 38,344 $ 240 $ 38,584 $ 36,812 $ 224 $ 37,036\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nEmerging Emerging\nWater Technologies Total Water Technologies Total\n(In thousands)\nMiddle East and Africa $ 47,295 $ 399 $ 47,694 $ 38,272 $ 108 $ 38,380\nAsia 16,770 36 16,806 19,180 — 19,180\nAmericas 6,957 — 6,957 9,628 153 9,781\nEurope 6,329 87 6,416 3,542 277 3,819\nTotal revenue $ 77,351 $ 522 $ 77,873 $ 70,622 $ 538 $ 71,160\nThree months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nThe increase in MPD revenue of $2.2 million was due primarily to:\n• Desalination: The decrease in revenue of $0.6 million was due primarily to lower shipments of products to the Americas and\nMiddle East and Africa (“MEA”) markets, partially offset by higher shipments of products to the Asia and Europe markets.\n• Wastewater: The increase in revenue of $2.8 million was due primarily to higher shipments of products to the MEA market.\nThe decrease in OEM revenue of $0.4 million was due primarily to:\n• Desalination: The decrease in revenue of $0.6 million was due primarily to lower shipments of products to the Asia and Americas\nmarkets, partially offset by higher shipments of products to the MEA and Europe markets.\n• Wastewater: The increase in revenue of $0.3 million was due primarily to higher shipments of products to the Asia market,\npartially offset by lower shipments of products to the Europe and Americas markets.\n• Emerging Technology: The decrease in revenue of $0.1 million was due primarily to lower shipments of products.\nThe decrease in AM revenue of $0.2 million was due primarily to lower shipments of products to the Asia market, partially offset by\nhigher shipments of products to the Europe and MEA markets.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 22\nTable of Contents\nNine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nThe increase in MPD revenue of $6.6 million was due primarily to:\n• Desalination: The increase in revenue of $3.8 million was due primarily to higher shipments of products to the MEA, Asia and\nEurope markets, partially offset by lower shipments of products to the Americas market.\n• Wastewater: The increase in revenue of $2.8 million was due primarily to higher shipments of products to the MEA market.\nThe decrease in OEM revenue of $1.6 million was primarily due to:\n• Desalination: The decrease in revenue of $0.5 million was due primarily to lower shipments of products to the Asia and Americas\nmarkets, partially offset by higher shipments of products to the MEA and Europe markets.\n• Wastewater: The decrease in revenue of $0.9 million was due primarily to lower shipments of products in all markets, with the\nlargest decrease in the Europe market.\n• Emerging Technology: The decrease in revenue of $0.3 million was due primarily to an installment in Europe and sales to a gas\nproducer in the Americas, both occurring in the prior year.\nThe increase in AM revenue of $1.7 million was due primarily to higher shipments of product to the Americas, Asia, and the MEA\nmarkets, partially offset by lower shipments of product to the Asia market.\nConcentration of Revenue\nSee Note 10, “Concentrations,” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements\n(unaudited),” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the “Notes”) for further discussion regarding our concentration of revenue.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue.

As of September 30, 2024, there was unrestricted cash of\n$1.1 million held outside the U.S. We invest cash not needed for current operations predominantly in investment-grade, marketable debt\ninstruments with the intent to make such funds available for future operating purposes, as needed. Although these securities are available for\nsale, we generally hold these securities to maturity, and therefore, do not currently see a need to trade these securities in order to support our\nliquidity needs in the foreseeable future. We believe the risk of this portfolio to us is in the ability of the underlying companies or government\nagencies to cover their obligations at maturity, not in our ability to trade these securities at a profit. Based on current projections, we believe\nexisting cash balances and future cash inflows from this portfolio will meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.\nCredit Agreement\nWe entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMC”) on December 22, 2021 (as amended, the “Credit\nAgreement”). The Credit Agreement, which will expire on December 21, 2026, provides a committed revolving credit line of $50.0 million and\nincludes both a revolving loan and a letters of credit (“LCs”) component. The maximum allowable LCs under the credit line component of the\nCredit Agreement is $30.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, as of September 30, 2024, there were no revolving loans outstanding. In addition, as of September 30,\n2024, under the LCs component, we utilized $18.4 million of the maximum allowable credit line of $30.0 million, which included newly\nissued LCs, and previously issued and unexpired stand-by letters of credits (“SBLCs”) and certain non-expired commitments under the\nprevious Loan and Pledge Agreement with Citibank, N.A., which are guaranteed under the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024,\nthere was $17.4 million of outstanding LCs. These LCs had a weighted average remaining life of approximately 17 months.\nSee Note 6, “Lines of Credit,” of the Notes for further discussion related to the Credit Agreement.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 27\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 11,567 $ 12,272 $ (705)\nNet cash used in investing activities (22,171) (18,375) (3,796)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 5,795 1,184 4,611\nEffect of exchange rate differences on cash and cash equivalents (23) 27 (50)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (4,832) $ (4,892) $ 60\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities is subject to the project driven, non-cyclical nature of our business. Operating cash flow can\nfluctuate significantly from year to year, due to the timing of receipts of large project orders. Operating cash flow may be negative in one year\nand significantly positive in the next, consequently individual quarterly results and comparisons may not necessarily indicate a significant\ntrend, either positive or negative.\nThe lower net cash provided by operating assets and liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the\nprior year, was due primarily to the following factors:\n• Accounts receivable and contract assets: an increase in cash provided primarily related to an increase in revenues, the timing of\nbillings related to shipments of product or certification of installations, and collections on the account receivable balances;\n• Inventory: an increase in cash used primarily related to the increase in PXs manufactured for project deliveries in the fourth\nquarter of 2024 and early 2025; and\n• Accrued liabilities: an increase in cash used primarily related to a decrease in employee compensation and benefits, and a\nreduction of tax accruals.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities primarily relates to sales, maturities and purchases of investment-grade marketable debt\ninstruments, such as corporate notes and bonds, and capital expenditures supporting our growth. We believe our investments in marketable\ndebt instruments are structured to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing\nrisk. The higher net cash used in investing activities of $3.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior\nyear, was primarily driven by $3.8 million of net cash used for purchases of marketable debt instruments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the cash provided by\nfinancing activities in the prior year, was due primarily to an increase of cash from exercises of employee stock options granted under our\nequity incentive plans.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 28\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nWe believe that our existing resources and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital\nrequirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue\nto fund our operations or to support acquisitions in the future and/or to fund investments in our latest technology arising from rapid market\nadoption. These needs could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Our future capital requirements will depend on many\nfactors including the continuing market acceptance of our products, our rate of revenue growth, the timing of new product introductions, the\nexpansion of our R&D, manufacturing and S&M activities, and the timing and extent of our expansion into new geographic territories. In\naddition, we may enter into potential material investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies in the\nfuture which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Should we need additional liquidity or capital funds, these funds\nmay not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1, “Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies – Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1, “Financial Statements (unaudited),” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 29\nTable of Contents\nItem 3 — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur exposure to market risk may be found primarily in two areas, foreign currency and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur foreign currency exposures are due to fluctuations in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar (“USD”) versus the British pound, Saudi\nriyal, Emirati dirham, European euro, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Canadian dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates could adversely\naffect our consolidated operating results or financial position.\nOur revenue contracts have been denominated in the USD. At times, our international customers may have difficulty in obtaining\nthe USD to pay our receivables, thus increasing collection risk and potential bad debt expense. To the extent we expand our international\nsales, a larger portion of our revenue could be denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, our cash and operating results could be\nincreasingly affected by changes in exchange rates.\nIn addition, we pay many vendors in foreign currency and, therefore, are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our\ninternational sales and service operations incur expense that is denominated in foreign currencies. This expense could be materially affected\nby currency fluctuations. Our international sales and services operations also maintain cash balances denominated in foreign currencies. To\ndecrease the inherent risk associated with translation of foreign cash balances into our reporting currency, we do not maintain excess cash\nbalances in foreign currencies.\nWe have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because expenses in foreign currencies have been\ninsignificant to date and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, we do not\nhave any exposure to the Russian ruble.\nInterest Rate and Credit Risks\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without\nsignificantly increasing risk. We invest primarily in investment-grade short-term and long-term marketable debt instruments that are subject\nto counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, we invest pursuant to an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors. The policy\nmandates high credit rating requirements and restricts our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio of $88.1 million, in investment-grade marketable debt instruments, such as U.S.\ntreasury securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal and agency notes and bonds, are classified as either cash equivalents or\nshort-term and/or long-term investments on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are subject to interest rate\nfluctuations and decrease in market value to the extent interest rates increase, which occurred during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. To minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates, we maintain investments with a weighted average maturity of\napproximately eight months. As of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would have resulted in a less than\n$0.4 million decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable debt instruments as of such date.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 30\nTable of Contents\nItem 4 — Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated\nthe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the\nend of the period covered by this report.\nBased on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | Q3'2024 Form 10-Q | 31\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1 — Legal Proceedings\nWe have been, and may be from time to time, involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of\nbusiness.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore,\nactual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Readers are directed to risks and\nuncertainties identified under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and elsewhere in this report for factors that may cause actual results to be\ndifferent from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or\nupdate publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason.\nForward-looking statements in this report include, without limitation, statements about the following:\n•our belief that the pressure exchanger is the industry standard for energy recovery in the seawater reverse osmosis\ndesalination (“SWRO”) industry;\n•our

States of America (the “U.S.”)\nand China will inevitably develop and provide further revenue growth opportunities;\n•our belief that countries around the world will continue to mandate ZLD or MLD requirements for specific industries;\n•our belief that, as the existing thermal technology is replaced with RO technology, demand for our products will be created;\n•our belief that our PX offers market-leading value with the highest technological and economic benefit;\n•our belief that ongoing operating costs and life cycle costs rather than the initial capital expenditures are the key factor in the\nselection of an energy recovery device solution for megaproject (“MPD”) customers;\n•our belief that initial capital expenditure rather than future ongoing operating costs is more of a factor in the selection of an\nenergy recovery device solution for original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) projects;\n•our belief that our PX has a distinct competitive advantage in the market for desalination plants and numerous wastewater\nmarket verticals, because our PX 1) has minimal unplanned and planned downtime, resulting in lower lifecycle maintenance\ncost, 2) is a cost-effective energy recovery solution, 3) is made with highly durable and corrosion-resistant aluminum oxide\n(“alumina”) ceramic parts and outperforms our competition with respect to quality, flexibility and

With a strong foundation in the desalination industry, we\nhave delivered transformative solutions that help our customers optimize their operations and reduce their energy consumption for more than\n30 years. We believe that our customers do not have to sacrifice quality and cost savings for sustainability; and we are committed to\ndeveloping solutions that drive long-term value from a technical, financial, and environmental perspective.\nWe have been incorporated in the state of Delaware since 2001. Our corporate headquarters, principal research and development\n(“R&D”), and manufacturing facility is located in San Leandro, California. In addition, we have manufacturing and warehouse space in Tracy,\nCalifornia and offices, warehouse space and a yard in Katy, Texas. We have a global direct sales team and on-site technical support staff to\nservice customers in the United States of America (the “U.S.”), Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia.\nSustainability\nOur technology harnesses the powerful combination of performance and energy efficiency to deliver operational profitability and help\nour customers achieve environmentally sustainable operations. As such, we are committed to measuring and managing our own operational\nimpact, as well as producing high-quality energy recovery devices for our customers. While sustainability has always been central to our\nbusiness, four years ago we embarked on our formal sustainability journey to turn the lens on ourselves and provide our stakeholders with\nfurther transparency around our company. Our integrated sustainability strategy includes a dedicated sustainability team, internal\nsustainability programs focused on key goals with measurable targets, and sustainability solutions for our customers.\nOur sustainability goals, which we believe are highly influential to our business, were first announced in our 2020 Sustainability\nReport. These goals focus on four sustainability topics – Employees, Environmental & Climate Change Risks, Innovation & Opportunity, and\nProducts. These topics were identified by our management team and our stakeholders as material to our company’s ability to create value.\nWe believe our goals provide us with a strategic roadmap to become a more sustainable and resilient business, and hold us accountable as\nwe strive to be a responsible corporate citizen. In accordance with our strategic roadmap, we announced our first corporate emissions\nreduction target in 2023 and have committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions as outlined in our 2022 Sustainability Report.\nEmployees. Our employees are integral to success and innovation. It is our firm commitment and responsibility to provide a safe and\nsupportive working environment for our staff where initiative is rewarded, suggestions are valued, and ideas to enhance our company or our\nproducts are implemented. Likewise, it is our responsibility to offer ample opportunities for employees to develop their skills. For more\ninformation on our employees and programs, please see Human Capital Resources below.\nEnvironmental & Climate Change Risks. We are engaged in a comprehensive assessment to identify our short-, medium-, and long-\nterm climate-related risks and opportunities. As our business grows, we are vigilant in managing our climate-related risks to remain\nsuccessful and competitive in an ever-changing environment.\nInnovation & Opportunity. Innovation and a trusted relationship with our customers and industry partners is pivotal to this goal, as this\nallows us to understand our customers’ needs and pain points. By partnering with our customers and consistently striving to improve, we are\nconfident in our continued ability to contribute to our customers’ operational profitability while advancing environmental sustainability.\nProducts. We uphold the trust of the industries we serve by meticulously manufacturing products that not only deliver exceptional\nperformance and generate significant value, but also demonstrate reliability and safety. At our core, we aim to design and manufacture high-\nquality innovative products that deliver significant value to customers and help foster environmentally sustainable operations.\nIn 2023, we surveyed and interviewed investors, employees, and customers to ensure our sustainability strategy remains aligned with\nthe evolution of our business. The results of this assessment process and any associated adjustments to our sustainability priorities, goals,\nand roadmap will be disclosed in our forthcoming 2023 Sustainability Report.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 1\nDetailed disclosures on our sustainability performance can be found in our recent 2022 Sustainability Report, which is available for\ndownload on our website at: https://energyrecovery.com/sustainability/. We have included this website address only as an inactive textual\nreference and do not intend it to be an active link to our website.\nPressure Exchanger Technology\nOur pressure exchanger technology platform is at the heart of many of our solutions. It is designed to efficiently capture and transfer\npressure energy, making commercial and industrial processes more efficient and environmentally sustainable, thereby lowering costs, saving\nenergy, and minimizing emissions. This versatile technology is applicable to a wide range of industries that utilize pressurized fluids,\nincluding liquids and gas, and is ideal for a wide range of pressure ratings.\nOur pressure exchanger technology acts like a fluid piston, efficiently transferring energy between high- and low-pressure liquid and/\nor gas through continuously rotating ducts. Key to the operation of a pressure exchanger is the micron-level clearances between the rotor\nand the pressure exchanger’s stationary components, including the sleeve and the end covers. Fluid circulating within this clearance acts as\na lubricated bearing, minimizing frictional losses and wear for an extremely efficient exchange of pressure energy.\nThe original product application of our pressure exchanger technology, the PX® Pressure Exchanger® (“PX”) energy recovery device\nwas a major contributor to the advancement of seawater reverse osmosis desalination (“SWRO”) globally, addressing “energy intensity”,\nwhich is a key pain point for the industry. The PX, which we believe is today’s industry standard in energy recovery in desalination, reduces\nenergy use by up to 60% in SWRO facilities. It is this significant savings that allowed SWRO to supplant thermal desalination as today’s\ndesalination technology of choice. Today we continue to push the boundaries of our core technology to handle different operating\nenvironments and industrial applications and deliver reliable, high-performance solutions that generate cost savings and increase energy\nefficiency for our customers.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 2\nWater Treatment\nMarkets\nThe need for clean water and energy optimization around the world is intensifying, driven by population growth, industrialization, rapid\nurbanization, and climate change. Apart from seasonal variations, the attainable supply of fresh water generally remains fixed and is already\ndecreasing in some geographic areas, as we believe that the reliability of rainfall grows more erratic in many geographies, water levels drop\nin rivers and aquifers, and rising oceans encroach on historically fresh water sources near the coasts. These trends make the markets we\nserve, such as desalination and wastewater treatment, increasingly critical to meet growing global water demand. Our goal is to lower the\ncosts and emissions associated with water production and treatment in the desalination and wastewater markets, respectively. In addition,\nwe help the end user in their sustainability compliance goals.\nReverse osmosis (“RO”) is the preferred technology in the vast majority of desalination facilities and growing in importance in\nwastewater applications. As an industry leader in energy recovery devices, we deliver efficient, scalable solutions for recovering otherwise\nwasted energy in the RO process, thereby helping our customers lower their operating costs and reduce carbon emissions.\nDesalination\nWorldwide seawater desalination plants using our products produce over 30 million cubic meters of water per day (“m3/day”), enough\nto provide for more than 25% of U.S. population’s daily water needs at home. As water scarcity grows in communities across the globe, we\nare proud of our impact in enabling more affordable, sustainable access to this vital resource.\nTypical Process Flow Diagram\n* Main pump size reduced by up to 60% compared to a SWRO process not using any energy recovery device.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 3\nSeawater Reverse Osmosis Desalination. Energy intensive pumps are used to pressurize feed waters with varying concentrations of\nsalts, minerals and contaminants, which is then pumped through a semi-permeable membrane to achieve the desired water quantity and\nquality. This process results in fresh water, suitable for potable, agricultural and industrial use and a highly concentrated and pressurized\nconcentrate or brine stream. Rather than dissipating or “wasting” the pressure energy from the discharge brine, our PX, the most commonly\nadopted energy recovery solution, can transfer the pressure energy from the high-pressure discharge stream directly to a portion of the low-\npressure filtered feed water stream, thereby reducing the amount of flow required by the main high-pressure process pumps, which are the\nlargest consumers of power within the SWRO process. Our highly efficient technology can recycle this pressure energy at peak efficiencies\nup to 98%. This results in a more efficient process as the size of the high-pressure pumps are greatly reduced, no longer needed to be sized\nfor full membrane feed flow, and are now re-sized for the permeate flow, thus reducing the energy usage by up to 60%, compared to a\nsystem without energy recovery devices. As a result, our PXs have helped make seawater desalination an economically viable and more\nsustainable option in the production of potable water.\nBrackish Water Reverse Osmosis Desalination. The brackish RO process is similar to that of the SWRO process. Brackish water\ntypically has lower salt, mineral and contaminant content than seawater, therefore, fewer solids need to be removed and less energy is\nexpended on pressurizing the feed water. Due to the lower cost and available pressure energy involved, our low pressure PX and hydraulic\nturbochargers generally have characteristics more applicable to the brackish process. The salt content in the feed water will ultimately\ndetermine the system design and operating conditions which, in turn, will drive decisions related to the specification or type of energy\nrecovery device to be employed, if any.\nSeawater desalination has been our primary market for revenue generation, and brackish water applications are an emerging area of\npotential growth. These markets range from small, decentralized desalination plants, such as those used in cruise ships and resorts, to\nlarge-scale project (“megaproject”) desalination plants, defined as those which produce over 50 thousand m3/day. Because of the\ngeographical location of many significant water desalination projects, geopolitical and economic events can influence the timing of expected\nprojects. We anticipate that markets traditionally not associated with desalination, such as the U.S. and China, will inevitably develop and\nprovide further revenue growth opportunities.\nBoth seawater and brackish market opportunities are represented by newly constructed (“greenfield”) and existing (“brownfield”) water\ntreatment projects. These opportunities include retrofits, upgrades, and plant expansions, that either operate without an energy recovery\ndevice or utilize alternative energy recovery device technologies. The large-scale greenfield market has been the key market for our water\nbusiness and represents projects that are typically public in nature and involve a formal tendering process; while smaller projects, may be\nprivate in nature, may or may not involve a formal tendering process. Typical brownfield facilities face higher energy consumption and\nreduced plant availability due to legacy technologies and aging equipment and include improvements to existing operations, equipment\nupgrades and potential expansions of existing capacity.\nWe work directly with the project bidders, generally large project developers, engineering, procurement, and construction firms (“EPC”\nfirm), end-users, and industry consultants, to specify our products prior to the project being awarded, where possible. Once the project is\nawarded to an EPC firm, our normal sales process ensues. The greenfield market is highly competitive, and the tendering process pays\nclose attention to the cost to desalinate water (i.e., dollars per cubic meter of water produced). Retrofit opportunities may or may not have a\nformal tendering process. We typically approach the plant owners, operators, and/or end-users of these facilities to present our leading life-\ncycle cost value-proposition.\nWastewater\nThe wastewater market has more variety and covers a wide range of industries and geographies. As governments across the globe\nincrease their focus on water conservation, reuse, recycling, and limiting the amount of pollution, they are establishing more stringent\nrequirements for wastewater treatment to maximize water recovery, and to comply with growing freshwater withdrawal and discharge\nregulations. Zero or minimum liquid discharge (“ZLD” and “MLD”, respectively) applications are being observed in countries throughout the\nworld. We expect this trend to continue to expand as we observe the implementation of regulations on the discharge of wastewater effluents\nas the world responds to the growing gap between water availability and demand while focusing on minimizing and/or eliminating pollution\nfrom these industries.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 4\nEnergy Recovery Devices Utilized During Each Stage in the Treatment Train\nMany municipal and industrial industries are willing to adopt more sustainable water reuse practices and to reduce their reliance on\nexisting water resources. Sectors such as automotive, including electric vehicles, chemicals, pulp and paper, textiles, semiconductors, and\nother heavy industries are often large water consumers. Their water usage can compete with municipal and agricultural water resources,\nfurther straining potable water supply in areas already struggling with water scarcity.\nA variety of RO technologies may be utilized in the wastewater applications where our energy recovery solutions are applicable. Such\nprocesses are typically multi-staged, with each stage increasing in pressure as the wastewater is filtered to recover clean water from a\nwastewater stream and concentrate pollutants to a level where they can be economically utilized or safely disposed, rather than discharged\ninto the environment. Our energy recovery solutions, such as our hydraulic turbochargers, low-pressure PX, and our Ultra PX, can be\napplied to each of these stages.\nTechnology Conversion\nThe thermal desalination process was the dominant seawater desalination technology employed throughout the 1990s. In this\nprocess, thermal energy is used to evaporate water from heated seawater and subsequently condenses the vapor to produce fresh potable\nwater. Starting in the early 1990s, due to many factors including the introduction and greater usage of energy recovery devices, the process\nof choice for the desalination industry shifted from thermal- to membrane-based RO desalination.\nOver the past two decades RO desalination technology has become the predominant technology, supplanting thermal desalination\ntechnology as today’s desalination technology of choice. As water desalination plants that use the thermal desalination technology age, the\nindustry expects the majority of these plant owners to replace their existing thermal technology with RO desalination technology. These\nconversions are driving new demand for RO desalination equipment, which in turn creates demand for our products.\nWe also see a similar technology conversion in the wastewater market. Thermal technologies have been the technology of choice for\nRO systems seeking to maximize the removal of waste from the water used in the manufacturing process, such as in “ZLD” processes, where\nall water is recovered and contaminants are reduced to solid waste, and MLD processes, where near-ZLD processes produce small volumes\nof liquid waste. Similar to seawater desalination, thermal technologies are an energy- and cost-intensive method for cleaning water in these\ndischarge processes, with up to 50 percent of costs typically stemming from thermal treatments. Adopting ultra high-pressure reverse\nosmosis (“UHPRO”) treatment methods to achieve ZLD and MLD objectives moves the cost of these thermal technologies further\ndownstream. Our PX U Series pressure exchangers further reduce wasted energy of the UHPRO process by returning pressure energy to\nthe system, ultimately reducing overall energy costs and potentially lowering capital expenditures.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 5\nWater Treatment Solutions\nPressure Exchangers\nOur line of pressure exchangers are high efficiency isobaric energy recovery devices made of a ceramic cartridge supported by a\nhighly efficient hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearing system. Models in this product family are designed for use in a variety of reverse\nosmosis systems within the water treatment industry, including seawater and brackish desalination, and wastewater treatment.\nHigh Pressure PX Pressure Exchanger. Our highly efficient PX Pressure Exchanger family of energy recovery device\nproducts delivers unmatched energy savings for water treatment systems. We offer a variety of sizes defined by the flow and\npressure requirements of the system ranging as low as 20 and up to 400 gallons per minute (“gpm”) (as low as 4.5 and up to\n90.8 cubic meters of water per hour (“m3/h”)) per device at pressures between 400-1200 pounds per square inch (“psi”)\n(28-84 kilograms per square centimeter (“bar”)); however, our customers can design their energy recovery systems to achieve\nunlimited capacities by installing an array of PXs in parallel.\nSmall and large desalination projects around the world rely on our range of PXs to achieve optimal operations and\nmaximum energy savings, and we believe the scalability and versatility of our PX can achieve similar success in the emerging\nwastewater markets we are targeting.\nUltra PX. Our Ultra PX energy recovery device which, we believe, addresses key challenges, such as energy intensity\nand environmental impacts associated with treating wastewater in a variety of water treatment applications. Designed with\nthe pressure exchanger technology that powers our flagship high pressure PX, the Ultra PX, functions similarly to our PX but\ncan withstand higher pressures. We offer a variety of sizes defined by the flow and pressure requirements of the system\nranging as low as 10 and up to 250 gpm (or as low as 2.3 and up to 56.8 m3/h) per device at pressures between\n1200-1800 psi (84-126 bar); however, by installing an array of PXs in parallel, our customers can design their energy\nrecovery system to achieve unlimited capacities.\nWhile reverse osmosis adoption in wastewater treatment is growing, we believe our Ultra PX can help accelerate\nfurther adoption of reverse osmosis in the growing zero and minimum liquid discharge markets by\nenhancing RO’s affordability and efficiency compared to thermal treatment options, similar to the impact of\nour PX in the seawater desalination market.\nLow Pressure PX. Products in this family are ideal for municipal and industrial potable water reuse applications\nthat deploy low-pressure RO stages such as municipal wastewater reuse applications. We offer a variety of sizes defined\nby the flow and pressure requirements of the system ranging as low as 30 and up to 260 gpm (or as low as 6.8 and up to\n59.0 m3/h) per device at pressures between 80-400 psi (6-28 bar); however, by installing an array of PXs in parallel, our\ncustomers can design their energy recovery system to achieve unlimited capacities.\nPumps and Turbochargers\nWe offer high-pressure centrifugal pumps designed to complement our energy recovery devices for a wide range of\nRO plant capacities and applications.\nHydraulic turbochargers. Our AT and LPT hydraulic turbochargers are high efficiency centrifugal\nenergy recovery devices used in low-pressure brackish and high-pressure seawater desalination\nsystems and wastewater treatment markets. Our turbocharger product lines are highly efficient with\nstate-of-the-art engineering in a compact configuration. With custom-designed hydraulics that allow for\noptimum performance over a wide range of operating conditions, our turbocharger technology offers\nsolutions to capital cost constrained single-stage RO applications, inter-stage boost applications\ntypically found in brackish water desalination and some wastewater treatment systems.\nWe believe our hydraulic turbochargers deliver substantial savings, operational benefits, and ease of integration into systems.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 6\nPumps. RO requires specialized high-pressure membrane feed and, in pressure exchanger applications,\nhigh-pressure circulation pumps. We manufacture and/or supply specialized high-pressure feed and circulation\npumps for only a portion of the markets served by our energy recovery solutions. Our high-pressure feed pumps\nare designed to pressurize the membrane feed flow and overcome the osmotic pressure requirements of the feed\nwater resulting in the production of desalinated water. Our high-pressure circulation pumps are designed to\ncirculate and control the high-pressure flow through our PX and to compensate for small pressure losses across\nthe membranes, PX and associated process piping in many desalination and wastewater applications.\nSales and Marketing\nOur strategically located direct sales force offers our products through capital sale to our customers around the world. We maintain a\nsales and service footprint in strategic territories, such as in the U.S., China, India, Latin America, Spain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab\nEmirates, allowing rapid response to our customers’ needs. Our team is comprised of individuals with many years of desalination and\nwastewater treatment industry expertise. Aligned to the geographic breadth of our current and potential future customers, our product\nmarketing approach includes a strategic presence at water industry events across various regions. In addition, we leverage our industry and\nmarket intelligence to develop new solutions and services that can be adopted by our growing customer base.\nA significant portion of our revenue is from outside of the U.S. Additional segment and geographical information regarding our\nproduct revenue is included in Note 2, “Revenue,” Note 9, “Segment Reporting,” and Note 10, “Concentrations,” of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Notes”).\nCompetition\nAs the water industry has evolved, we faced, and continue to face, increasing worldwide competition based on product offerings and\nservice. While our technology has been embraced for many years as the industry standard in RO desalination plants, the competition has\nincreased over time whereby more companies are offering energy recovery devices similar to our devices. Furthermore, we expect our\ncompetition to begin offering new products that incorporate newer technology and materials that may work with existing and new RO\ndesalination and wastewater operations. We believe our flagship PX has a competitive advantage over products offered by our competitors,\nbecause our devices (1) are made with highly durable and corrosion-resistant aluminum oxide (“alumina”) ceramic parts that are designed for\na life of more than 25 years; (2) are, in certain circumstances, warrantied for high efficiencies; and (3) cause minimal unplanned and planned\ndowntime, resulting in lower lifecycle cost and cost-effective energy recovery solutions. In addition, our PX offers optimum scalability in both\nthe desalination and growing wastewater market with a quick startup and no scheduled maintenance, as well as having been proven in the\nmarket and trusted by our customers.\nProject Channels\nWe separate our Water segment sales into three distinct channels that are related to financial, other commercial, and technical\naspects of the projects. We identify these sales channels as megaproject (“MPD”), original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) and\naftermarket (“AM”).\nMegaproject. MPD customers are major firms that develop, design, build, own and/or operate large-scale desalination plants with\ncapacities greater than 13.2 million gallons/day (50 thousand m3/day). A majority of our water treatment revenue comes from this channel.\nOur MPD customers have the required desalination expertise to engineer, undertake procurement for, construct, and sometimes own and\noperate, large-scale desalination plants. Due to the project structures and capacities of these plants, ongoing operating costs and life cycle\ncosts, rather than the initial capital expenditures are the key factor in the customers’ selection of an energy recovery device solution. As\nsuch, MPD customers most often select our PX, which we believe offers market-leading value with the highest technological and economic\nbenefit. We work with our MPD customers to specify and optimize our PX solutions for their plant designs. The typical desalination and\nwastewater MPD project timeline between project tender and shipment generally ranges from 16 to 36 months; however, from time-to-time,\nmay exceed 36 months. Each project in this channel generally represents revenue opportunities over $1 million.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 7\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer. OEM customers are companies that supply equipment, packaged systems, and various operating\nand maintenance solutions for small- to medium-sized desalination and wastewater plants utilized by commercial and industrial entities, and\nnational, state, and local municipalities worldwide. We sell to our OEM customers a broad set of our products, including our PX, hydraulic\nturbochargers, high-pressure pumps, circulation booster pumps, and associated services. As it relates to desalination and wastewater OEM\nprojects, these projects comprise of plants processing up to 13.2 million gallons/day (50 thousand m3/day), such as those located in hotels\nand resorts, power plants, cruise ships, agricultural sectors, local and other municipal sites, and industrial facilities. In addition, these OEM\ncustomers purchase our solutions for mobile, decentralized “quick water” or emergency water solutions. Unlike MPD projects, desalination\nand wastewater OEM projects are smaller in scope and the initial capital expenditure, rather than future ongoing operating costs, is often\nmore of a factor in selection of an energy recovery device solution in desalination. Accordingly, we sell not only our PX, but also our\nhydraulic turbochargers, which offer a lower cost alternative to our PX. The typical desalination and wastewater OEM project timeline from\nproject tender to shipment generally ranges from one to 16 months; however, from time-to-time, may exceed 16 months. Each project in this\nchannel typically represents revenue opportunities up to $1 million. Early stage revenue from these projects are dependent on the size of\nsystem or retrofit of our customers’ projects.\nAftermarket. Aftermarket customers are desalination or wastewater plant owners and/or operators who can utilize our technology to\nupgrade or keep their plant running optimally, and usually have our solutions installed and in operation. We provide spare parts, repair\nservices, field services and various commissioning activities. We leverage our industry expertise in supporting our existing installed base to\nensure that our energy recovery solutions are being operated effectively and efficiently in order to maximize plant availability and overall\nprofitability of the facility operations, as required by our industry partners and customers.\nSeasonality\nThere is no specific seasonality to desalination or wastewater revenue. Desalination or wastewater revenue occurs throughout a\ncalendar year. We often experience substantial fluctuations in desalination or wastewater revenue from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-\nyear primarily due to the timing and execution of our MPD shipments, which vary from year to year.\nEmerging Technologies\nToday, we are leveraging our pressure exchanger technology platform to develop new product applications and diversify into new\nindustries. We continue to push the limits of what our pressure exchanger technology can do, which we believe will unlock new commercial\nopportunities in the future.\nCO\n2\nThe global refrigeration and heating industries are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, of which the leakage of\nhydrofluorocarbon (“HFC”) refrigerants within these closed systems are the leading cause. HFCs have been recognized as a significant\ncontributor to global warming, up to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide (“CO ”) used as a refrigerant. In 2016, much of the\n2\nworld adopted the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol with the intent of reducing HFCs by 85% in developed nations by 2036, and\nglobally by 2047. The European Union’s consumption of HFCs was 55% below targets by end of 2022, and they plan to reduce by 80% by\n2030. The U.S. first supported the reduction of HFCs in the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act in 2020, later ratified the Kigali\nAmendment itself in October 2022, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized the rules in July 2023 to reduce HFC production\nand imports by 70% by end of 2029, and 85% by 2036.\nCO used as a refrigerant is a climate-friendly alternative to greenhouse gas-emitting HFCs and has been the natural refrigerant of\n2\nchoice for decades in Europe and Japan, where tens of thousands of CO implementations have occurred to date. CO -based refrigeration\n2 2\nsystems for commercial and industrial applications are safe, sustainable, and commercially available; however, a CO -based refrigeration\n2\nsystem can also consume significant amounts of electricity, especially in warm environments, making them expensive to operate. We believe\nour PX G1300™, which uses proven pressure exchanger technology to improve CO -based refrigeration system performance, can contribute\n2\nto solving this challenge and help make CO -based refrigeration economically viable in a broader range of climates. When integrated into\n2\nnew or existing systems, the PX G1300 can reduce compressor workload to increase cooling capacity, system stability, and energy\nefficiency.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 8\nPX G1300. Our refrigeration-focused product leverages our existing ceramics, material science, and\nmanufacturing expertise. The PX G1300 can reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of CO -based\n2\nrefrigeration systems in a broad range of operating conditions. We see this as potentially a significant accelerator for\nadoption of CO -based refrigeration system globally as our PX G1300 could eventually alter the standard refrigeration\n2\nsystem architecture by reducing costs for end users, such as grocery stores.\nWe designed the PX G1300 to be integrated into new or existing CO -based refrigeration systems. The\n2\nPX G1300 can integrate with any existing rack controller and is easy to operate and maintain. We believe the simplicity\nof installation and the ease of operations could encourage adoption of this new technology.\nSales and Marketing\nWe believe there is a significant potential market for the PX G1300 in a variety of channels, such as supermarket chains and cold\nstorage facilities. The build of these commercial and industrial refrigeration systems is large enough and demands enough flow of CO\n2\nrefrigerant to warrant the use of our device, which today implies any system 80 kilowatt in size or greater.\nIn understanding the market for the PX G1300, we have identified three major value propositions:\n1.Energy Savings and Emissions Reduction. The PX G1300 recycles the high-pressure energy of a CO system by compressing a\n2\nportion of the gas flow for “free.” This “free” compression provided by the PX G1300 allows the main electrical refrigeration\ncompressor to work less to keep the refrigeration system at the same temperature. In this way, our PX G1300 contributes to\nlower energy consumption and lower costs by reducing the amount of cycles the main compressor operates, and thereby lower\nemissions in a CO refrigeration system.\n2\n2.Increased Cooling Capacity. The PX G1300 can add compression capacity to a transcritical CO -based refrigeration system to\n2\nsafeguard against high discharge pressure failures, which occur during heatwaves when refrigeration systems are under stress.\n3.Initial Capital Investment. When designed into a new CO -based refrigeration system, the PX G1300 may offset some initial\n2\ncapital investment due to the extra compression capacity it provides, allowing for the reduction or removal of other components.\nThe magnitude of each of these value propositions, or lack thereof, will greatly depend on the geographic location of a refrigeration\nsystem and temperature ranges that location experiences, the cost of energy at that location, the specific architecture of the refrigeration\nsystem itself and possibly other parameters.\nChannels and Customers\nCO sales are reported under our OEM sales channel. This includes direct sales to commercial or industrial customers, such as\n2\nsupermarket chains, cold storage facilities, and other industrial users. Also, included are sales to intermediaries, such as refrigeration system\ninstallers or refrigeration OEMs, to whom we sell the PX G1300 and associated services for inclusion in these customers’ entire new\npackaged or retrofit of existing systems.\nThe commercial refrigeration market ecosystem has multiple players who integrate the components to build a system. These players\ninclude supermarkets, which are the end users of the systems; contractors and installers that assist with the installation and maintenance of\nthe systems; refrigeration OEMs; and design consultants that assist in designing and specifying the systems for end users and in providing\nthe component specifications to the refrigeration OEMs.\nWe initially sold the PX G1300 to a variety of customers, such as directly to an end user supermarket chain and OEMs. We believe\nthat once the PX G1300 is more established, our sales process will evolve primarily to sell through OEMs, who in turn build and install\nrefrigeration systems at sites maintained by end users.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 9\nCompetition\nThe concept of energy recovery is a new one in the refrigeration industry. Therefore, unlike in our water markets, there is no direct\nanalogous competitor to our pressure exchanger technology. However, there are a variety of cost saving methods, as well as alternative\ndevices, that refrigeration manufacturers may try to introduce into their configurations to reduce energy consumption within their CO -based\n2\nrefrigeration systems. These cost saving methods include utilizing novel system architectures, new and improved equipment or materials,\nejectors or other energy recovery devices, and/or other technologies that could improve energy efficiency. These cost savings methods may\nor may not be compatible with the PX G1300. As CO -based refrigeration systems become more prevalent, we believe competitive\n2\ntechnologies and devices could arise.\nSeasonality\nThere is no specific CO revenue seasonality to highlight in the early stages of this product lifecycle.\n2\nManufacturing\nOur products, including our PX, hydraulic turbochargers, high-pressure pumps, and circulation booster pumps, are designed,\nmanufactured, assembled, and tested in two facilities located in California. Our facilities include advanced ceramics manufacturing and\ntesting equipment.\nWe obtain raw, processed, and certain pre-machined materials from various suppliers to support our manufacturing operations. A\nlimited number of these suppliers are single source to maintain material consistency and support new product development. However,\nalthough we may purchase from certain single source suppliers, we have qualified redundant source(s) to ensure consistent supply for many\nof our critical raw materials and manufactured components. Alumina ceramic components for our PX products are manufactured in-house\nfrom high-purity alumina to the final product. We are able to leverage our ceramics manufacturing across all of our PX product lines.\nThrough our vertically integrated ceramics precision manufacturing process, we ensure that all components meet our high standards for\nquality, durability, and reliability. The components for our other products undergo final precision machining to protect the proprietary nature of\nour manufacturing methods and product designs, and to maintain premium quality standards.\nWe are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our operations. We recognize that as we pursue our strategy of diversified\nand disciplined growth, our operations and our impact on the environment may increase. Some of the ways we currently seek to minimize\nour environmental impact are by reducing consumption of resources through waste management strategies, optimizing the use of renewable\nenergy, and monitoring key environmental indicators. For example, as part of our waste management strategies, during the machining\nphase, when the solid components are shaped, excess high-purity alumina powder is collected, processed, and then reused. Further, we\nhave incorporated in our testing process multiple test loops, which allows us to test products we manufacture to their operating conditions.\nThese test loops, which are a major driver of our water usage, have been modified to allow us to recycle most of the water used in these\ntesting cycles. Our efforts to measure and manage our impact will continue to evolve as our business grows.\nResearch, Development and Technology\nResearch and development (“R&D”) has been, and remains, an essential part of our history, culture and corporate strategy. Since our\nformation, we have developed leading technology and engineering expertise through the evolution of our pressure exchanger technology,\nwhich can enhance environmental sustainability and improve productivity by reducing energy consumption in pressurized fluid-flow systems.\nThis versatile technology works as a platform to build product applications and is at the heart of many of our products. In addition, we have\nengineered and developed ancillary devices, such as our hydraulic turbochargers and circulation booster pumps that complement our energy\nrecovery devices.\nToday, we are applying our pressure exchanger technology in new and important ways, building new products to accelerate\nenvironmental sustainability across more industries. Our investments into R&D are focused on (1) advancing our solutions to better service\nhistorical markets, such as desalination; (2) applying our pressure exchanger technology to new markets, such as our recent entries into the\nwastewater and CO markets; and (3) fundamental research into new applications of our pressure exchanger technology in existing and new\n2\nverticals.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 10\nWe recognize the importance of carefully stewarding resources to support our ongoing R&D program. We maintain advanced\nanalytical and testing capabilities to evaluate our solutions at all company sites. We have developed complex analytical tools which allow us\nto be less reliant on full-scale testing that is costly and often uses considerable amounts of water and consumable energy. Our advanced\nnumerical modeling and analytical tools allow for 3-dimensional, multi-phase, multi-physics, and multi-scale, computational fluid dynamics,\nfluid structure interactions, thermodynamics, and system analysis. Leading-edge modeling and analytical techniques coupled with extensive\nstate of the art experimental capabilities allow us to further refine our existing water and refrigeration technologies, as well as developing new\nderivatives of our pressure exchanger technology for complex systems and applications.\nOur highly skilled engineering team, many of whom carry accreditation from world-recognized engineering organizations, specialize in\na range of technical fields critical to support our current product lines and advance our incubation initiatives, including core engineering\ncompetencies of fluid mechanics and aerodynamics, solid mechanics with expertise in computational fluid dynamics and finite element\nanalysis, bearings design (roller-element, hydrostatic, and hydrodynamic), multi-phase flow, dynamics and controls, acoustics and vibrations,\ntribology, material science and coatings, pumps and turbines, turbo-machinery, and rotating equipment.\nIntellectual Property\nWe seek patent protection for new technologies, inventions, and improvements that are likely to be incorporated into our solutions.\nWe rely on patents, trade secret laws, and contractual safeguards to protect the proprietary tooling, processing techniques, and other know-\nhow used in the production of our solutions. We have a robust intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio consisting of U.S. and international issued\npatents as well as pending patent applications.\nWe have registered the following trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark office: “ERI,” “PX,” “PX Pressure\nExchanger,” “Pressure Exchanger,” “Ultra PX,” “PX PowerTrain,” “PX G1300,” and the Energy Recovery logo. We have also applied for and\nreceived registrations in international trademark offices.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur employees are key to our Company’s success. We believe we have a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and we work to\ncreate an inclusive, exciting, safe, and supportive environment, for all of our employees. Our company is built around innovation and driven\nby diversity of thought and background. Our employees challenge the status quo, actively partner to resolve challenges, and seek to\ncontinuously improve themselves as well as our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 269 full-time employees, which is approximately 100% of our staffing, and include both permanent\nand leased employees. Our leased employees include sales and service agents worldwide, and IT support. Our employees are not\nunionized, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nWe are proud to have built a global workforce to match our global customer base. Our employees represent a broad array of\nbackgrounds, professionally and personally, and we believe that this diversity of experience and perspectives is a competitive advantage that\nallows us to better serve the needs of our customers.\nOur Code of Business Conduct (our “Code”) serves as a critical tool to help all of us recognize and report unethical conduct, while\npreserving and nurturing our culture. Our Code is reflected in our employee manual, which we provide to all of our employees, and training\nprograms. Both our employee manual and training programs include our policies against harassment and bullying, and the elimination of\nbias in the workplace.\nRecruiting, Training and Retention\nOur focus is to create an engaged employee experience, throughout the process of attracting, onboarding, developing, and retaining\nemployees. We are committed to supporting employee development as well as providing competitive benefits and a safe workplace. We\nsupport and develop our employees through global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and\nprofessional skills while striving to enhance our employee’s financial, mental and physical wellness. To assess and improve employee\nretention and engagement, we survey our employees with the assistance of a third-party employee engagement survey, and take action to\naddress areas of employees’ concerns.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 11\nOur employee engagement efforts include newsletters and all-employee town hall meetings, as well as informational meetings, which\nincludes our executive staff meeting with small groups of employees in an informal setting, through which we aim to keep all of our\nemployees well-informed, increase transparency and promote a culture of open communication. Our values and ethics serve as the guiding\nforce through which we proactively maintain the highest standards of business conduct.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe believe that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable our employees to share in our company’s\nsuccess. In addition, we recognize our employees are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time\nand support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a wide variety of benefits for our employees and\nwe invest in tools and resources that are designed to support our employees’ individual growth and development.\nOur compensation and benefit programs are designed to recognize our employees’ contributions to value, ingenuity and business\nresults, including variable pay, which rewards each employee for the Company’s and individual’s performance. All full-time and full-time\nequivalent employees, where allowed, are included in our share-based equity incentive program, and are offered health and welfare benefits,\nmental wellness programs, development programs and training courses. In addition, all employees are afforded the opportunity to give back\nto our communities through donations of time and money through our company sponsored programs.\nWorkplace Heath and Safety\nWe are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace. We continuously strive to meet or exceed compliance with all laws,\nregulations and accepted practices pertaining to workplace safety. All employees are required to comply with established safety policies,\nstandards and procedures, and to attend and complete annual safety training based on their job function. To accomplish our safety goals, we\ndeveloped and maintain company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each employee, as well as compliance with domestic and international\nsafety standards. In addition, we foster work/life balance for our employees that provides significant flexibility surrounding work location and\nwork schedules.\nAdditional Information\nOur website is https://energyrecovery.com. We also maintain an Investor Relations website as a routine channel for distribution of\nimportant information, including news releases, presentations, and financial statements (https://ir.energyrecovery.com).

Other risks and uncertainties, including those not currently known\nto us or our management, could also negatively impact our businesses, results of operations, and financial conditions. Accordingly, the\nfollowing should not be considered a complete discussion of all of the risks and uncertainties we may face. We may amend or supplement\nthese risk factors from time to time in other reports we file with the SEC.\nRisks Related to our Water Segment\nOur Water segment revenues largely depend on the construction of new large-scale desalination plants and the retrofit of existing\ndesalination plants, and as a result, our operating results have historically experienced, and may continue to experience,\nsignificant variability due to volatility in capital spending, availability of project financing, project timing, execution and other\nfactors affecting the broader water desalination industry.\nWe currently derive the majority of our Water segment revenues from sales of energy recovery products and services used in newly\nconstructed, large-scale desalination plants and the retrofit of existing desalination plants, particularly in dry or drought-ridden regions of the\nworld. The demand for our products used in the Water segment may decrease if the construction of these large-scale desalination plants or\nthe retrofit of existing plants declines for any reason, including, any global or regional economic downturns, worsening global or regional\npolitical conflicts, worsening regional conditions, changing government priorities, or the impact of any global or regional conflicts.\nOther factors that could affect the number and capacity of large-scale desalination plants built or the timing of their completion, include\nthe availability of required engineering and design resources; availability of credit and other forms of financing; the health of the global\neconomy; inflation rates; changes in government regulation, permitting requirements, or priorities; and reduced capital spending for water\ndesalination solutions. Each of these factors could result in reduced or uneven demand for our products. Pronounced variability or delays in\nthe construction of such plants or reductions in spending for desalination in general could negatively impact our Water segment sales, which\nin turn could have an adverse effect on our entire business, financial condition, or results of operations, and make it difficult for us to\naccurately forecast our future sales.\nOur Water segment faces competition from a number of companies that offer competing energy recovery solutions. If any of these\ncompanies produce superior products or offers their products at substantially lower prices, our competitive position in the market\ncould be harmed and our revenues may decline.\nThe market for energy recovery devices for desalination and other water treatment plants is becoming increasingly competitive and\nwe expect this competition to intensify as the desalination and wastewater markets continue to grow. Competitors have introduced products\nthat are similar to, and directly compete with, our key energy recovery products. In addition, we expect new competitors to enter the market,\nand existing competitors to introduce improvements to their existing products and introduce new products that are directly competitive to our\nsolutions. Our competitors’ existing, new, and improved products may be superior to our products and/or could be offered at prices that are\nconsiderably less than the cost of our products. The performance and pricing pressure of such new products could cause us to adjust the\nprices of certain products to remain competitive, or we may not be able to continue to win large contracts, which could adversely affect our\nmarket share, competitive position and margins. Some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial,\ntechnical, marketing, and other resources; longer operating histories; or greater name recognition. They may also have more extensive\nproducts and product lines that would enable them to offer multi-product or packaged solutions as well as competing products at lower prices\nor with other more favorable terms and conditions. As a result, our ability to sustain our market share may be adversely impacted, which\nwould affect our business, product margins, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, if one of our competitors were to merge or\npartner with another company, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our continuing ability to compete effectively.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 13\nA sustained downturn in the economy or global unrest could impact the future of new, and the retrofit of existing, desalination\nplants, and the treatment of various wastewater verticals, which could result in decreased demand for our water products and\nservices.\nThe demand for our water products and services depends primarily on the continued construction of new large-scale desalination\nplants, the retrofit of existing plants, and the construction of wastewater treatment facilities, particularly in the countries that are part of the\nGulf Cooperation Council, China, and India. Weak economic conditions, inflation and global uncertainty including the continuing conflicts in\nUkraine and many parts of the Middle East may have a negative economic impact on these and other countries, which may impact the levels\nof spending on, timing of, delays to, and availability of, project financing for new desalination and retrofit plant projects. The inability of our\ncustomers to secure credit or financing for these projects, may result in the postponement or cancellation of these projects. In addition, the\nchange in government priorities and/or their reduction in spending for water treatment projects could result in decreased demand for our\nproducts and services, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in developing suitable market adoption for our products in the wastewater market.\nWe have introduced a number of products designed specifically for the wastewater market, including the Ultra PX family of products\nand the low pressure PX. The wastewater market is evolving and covers a wide range of industries and geographies, and utilizes a variety of\nRO technologies. While our products can be a potential solution to these different applications, there is no guarantee that we will be\nsuccessful in developing market adoption of our wastewater products. While countries like China and India are beginning to mandate zero or\nminimum liquid discharge (“ZLD” and “MLD”, respectively) requirements for specific industries, in many parts of the world there are no\nregulations or minimal regulations for treating wastewater. Accordingly, end users in such areas may not be willing to implement wastewater\ntreatment at all or, if they do plan to implement a wastewater treatment program, they may select a competitive or alternative wastewater\ntreatment technology. Similar to the desalination market, there are many competitors and competitive products that can service wastewater\nindustries that do not include RO technologies or utilize our products. These competitors may have existing relationships with end users,\ngreater name recognition, and/or significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources that may make it challenging for us\nto compete in this industry. As a result of the foregoing, we may not be able to successfully develop our wastewater business, develop any\nmarket share, or win any large contracts, which would affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Emerging Technologies Segment\nWe may not be able to successfully compete in the CO -based refrigeration system market.\n2\nFor the past decade, the global commercial and industrial refrigeration industry has been shifting away from HFC-based refrigerants\nto natural refrigerants, such as CO -based refrigerants in response to the global HFC-based refrigerant phase-down and subsequent\n2\nenvironmental regulations. We introduced the PX G1300 energy recovery device for use in CO -based refrigeration systems in 2021 and\n2\ncontinue to work on developing market adoption of this new technology. While interest in the PX G1300 has been positive, there is no\nguarantee that we will be successful in generating sustained interest and, more importantly, adoption of our technology on a timeline\nnecessary to meet our goals, or at all. The global commercial and industrial refrigeration industry can be slow to adopt new technologies and\nalternative technologies or new refrigerants may emerge, slowing the adoption of the PX G1300. In addition, we may encounter new\ntechnological challenges that we will need to solve in order to achieve adoption of the technology. The global commercial and industrial\nrefrigeration industry is also saturated with very large, established companies who have greater experience and resources and may provide\ncost saving methods that utilize novel system architectures, new and improved equipment or materials, ejectors and/or other energy recovery\ndevices, all or some of which could improve energy efficiency that compete against the PX G1300. If we are unable to solve any\ntechnological challenges, generate and sustain sufficient interest for our CO -based refrigeration technology, we may not be able to\n2\nsuccessfully compete in the CO -based refrigeration market, which could have an adverse effect on our CO business, and our Emerging\n2 2\nTechnologies segment financial condition or results of operation.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 14\nWe may not be able to develop future new technologies successfully.\nWe have made a substantial investment in R&D and sales and marketing to execute on our diversification strategy into fluid flow\nmarkets, including our recent commercial refrigeration products. While we see diversification as core to our growth strategy, there is no\nguarantee that we will be successful in our efforts. Our model for growth is based in part on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive\ntechnology trends, to enter new markets, both in terms of geographies and product areas, and to drive broad adoption of the products and\nservices that we develop and market. Our competitive position and future growth depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to\nsuccessfully: (i) innovate, develop and maintain competitive products, and services to address emerging trends and meet customers’ needs,\n(ii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, (iii) enhance our product and service offerings by adding\ninnovative features or disruptive technologies that differentiate them from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization, (iv) develop,\nmanufacture and bring compelling new products and services to market quickly and cost-effectively, (v) attract, develop and retain individuals\nwith the requisite innovation and technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies, products and\nservices, and (vi) continue to invest in manufacturing, R&D, engineering, sales and marketing, and customer support. Any inability to execute\nthis model for growth could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operation results. In addition, profitability, if\nany, in new industrial verticals may be lower than in our Water segment, and we may not be sufficiently successful in our diversification\nefforts to recoup investments. The failure of our technologies, products or services to maintain and gain market acceptance due to more\nattractive offerings, or customers’ slower-than-expected adoption of, and investment in, our new and innovative technologies could\nsignificantly reduce our revenues or market share and adversely affect our competitive position.\nRisks Related to our General Business\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, making our future operating results difficult to predict and causing our operating\nresults to fall below expectations.\nOur quarterly and yearly operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. We have\nexperienced significant fluctuations in revenue from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we expect such fluctuations to continue. In\naddition, in the past, customer buying patterns led to a significant portion of our sales occurring in the fourth quarter. This presents the risk\nthat delays, cancellations, or other adverse events in the fourth quarter could have a substantial negative impact on that year’s annual\nresults. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Since it is difficult for us to\nanticipate the impact of these fluctuations on our future results, in the event our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of\ninvestors or securities analysts, our stock price may be negatively affected.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our\nsales are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from quarter to quarter, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nOur sales efforts involve substantial education of our current and prospective customers about the use and benefits of our energy\nrecovery products. This education process can be time-consuming and typically involves a significant product evaluation process which is\nparticularly pronounced when dealing with product introduction into new fluid flow industrial verticals. In our Water segment, the average\nWater segment sales cycle for our international MPD customers, which are involved with larger desalination plants, typically ranges from 16\nto 36 months, and may exceed 36 months from time-to-time, and the average sales cycle for our OEM customers, which are involved with\nsmaller desalination plants, ranges from one to 16 months, and may exceed 16 months from time-to-time. These long sales cycles make\nrevenue predictions difficult and results in our expending significant resources well in advance of orders for our products, which may cause\nour operating results to fluctuate and may adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur Water contracts often contain holdback provisions of up to 10% of the contract price. If we are unable to collect unbilled\nreceivables, which are caused in part by these holdback provisions, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur Water contracts with large EPC firms generally contain holdback provisions that typically delay final installment payments for our\nproducts by up to 24 months after the product has been shipped and revenue has been recognized. Generally, 10% or less of the revenue\nwe recognize pursuant to our customer contracts is subject to such holdback provisions and is generally accounted for as contract assets.\nSuch holdbacks may result in relatively high unbilled receivables. If we are unable to collect these performance holdbacks, our operating\nresults and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 15\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for some of our components. If our suppliers are not able to meet our demand and/or\nrequirements, our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for vessel housings, stainless steel ports, and alumina powder for our portfolio of energy\nrecovery devices and stainless steel castings and components for our hydraulic turbochargers and pumps. Our reliance on a limited number\nof manufacturers for these supplies involves several risks, including reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance,\nmanufacturing yields, production costs caused by rising inflation, and lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply. We may\nqualify additional suppliers in the future, which would require time and resources. If we do not qualify additional suppliers, we may be\nexposed to increased risk of capacity shortages due to our dependence on current suppliers.\nWe do not have long-term supply agreements with our suppliers but secure our supplies on a purchase order basis. Our suppliers\nhave no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantity, or at any specific price, except as set forth in a\nparticular purchase order. Our requirements may represent a small portion of the total production capacities of these suppliers, and our\nsuppliers may reallocate capacity to other customers, even during periods of high demand for our products. We have in the past\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, product quality issues and delivery delays with our suppliers due to factors such as high\nindustry demand or the inability of our vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. If our suppliers were to cancel or\nmaterially change their commitments to us or fail to meet quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products,\nwe could lose time-sensitive customer orders, be unable to develop or sell our products cost-effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have\nsignificantly decreased revenue, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to manufacturing risks, particularly related to new products, which could lead to excessive scrap, quality defects,\nwarranty claims in excess of our warranty provision or result in a significant or a large number of warranty or other claims in any\ngiven year.\nWe manufacture most of our products in our facilities. In connection with new products, we may sometimes need to develop new\nmanufacturing processes and techniques that may lead to an increase in excess scrap compared to our more mature processes, as well as\nan increase in quality defects. We provide warranties for most of these products and while we test our products in our manufacturing facilities\nthrough a variety of means, there can be no assurance that our testing will reveal all quality defects in our products, which may not become\napparent until after the products have been sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk that we may incur increased expenses due to\nexcess scrap and significant warranty claims that will result in additional cost of revenue if our warranty provisions are not sufficient to cover\nthe actual cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products. If these additional expenses are significant, they could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nParts of our inventory may become excess or obsolete, which would increase our cost of revenues.\nInventory of raw materials, parts, components, work in-process, or finished products may accumulate, and we may encounter losses\ndue to a variety of factors, including technological change in the water desalination process; changes in the wastewater and refrigeration\nmarkets that result in product redesign; long delays in shipment of our products or order cancellations, and/or changes related to\nimprovements in existing product design; our need to order raw materials that have long-lead times; our inability to estimate exact amounts\nand types of items needed, especially with regard to the configuration of our high-efficiency pumps; and cost reduction initiatives resulting in\ncomponent changes within the products.\nIn addition, we may, from time-to-time, purchase more inventory than is immediately required in order to shorten our delivery time in\ncase of an anticipated increase in demand for our products. If we are unable to forecast demand for our products with a reasonable degree\nof certainty and our actual orders from our customers are lower than these forecasts, we may accumulate excess inventory that we may be\nrequired to write off, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not generate positive returns on our research and development strategy.\nDeveloping our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. While we\nbelieve one of our greatest strengths lies in our innovation and our product development efforts, successfully commercializing such efforts\nand generating a return can be difficult. We expect that our results of operations may be impacted by the timing and size of these\ninvestments. In addition, these investments may take several years to generate positive returns, if ever.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 16\nBusiness interruptions may damage our facilities or those of our suppliers.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers may be vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, flood, and other natural disasters, as\nwell as power loss, telecommunications failure, and other events beyond our control. Our headquarters in California is located near major\nearthquake faults and has experienced earthquakes in the past. In addition, our facilities in California are located in areas that are subject to\npublic safety power shutdowns (“PSPS”). If a natural disaster occurs or we are subject to PSPS, our ability to conduct our operations could\nbe seriously impaired, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We cannot be sure that the\ninsurance we maintain against general business interruptions will be adequate to cover all of our losses.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings and may be subject to additional future legal proceedings that may result\nin material adverse outcomes.\nIn addition to the IP litigation risks, we may become involved in the future in various commercial and other disputes as well as related\nclaims and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the course of our business. See Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies –\nLitigation,” of the Notes for information about certain legal proceedings in which we are involved. Our current legal proceedings and any\nfuture lawsuits to which we may become a party are, and will likely be, expensive and time consuming to investigate, defend and resolve, and\nwill divert our management’s attention. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not\nbe reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly\nunfavorable terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nWe release guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, quarterly earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future\nperformance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking\nstatements, will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections will not be prepared with a view toward\ncompliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountant\nnor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person will express any\nopinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently\nsubject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are\nbased upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We will continue to state possible\noutcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed. The high and low ranges are\nnot intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to\nprovide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any\nprojections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance\nfurnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what\nmanagement believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material.\nIn light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this\n“Risk Factors” section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance and\nthe differences may be adverse and material.\nIn preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our\nconsolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results.\nWe make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, and\nlong-lived assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. We also make\nassumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable\ncompensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for\ndoubtful accounts, and legal contingencies, if any. These assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and\nvarious other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual\nresults could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 17\nOur global operations expose us to risks and challenges associated with conducting business internationally, and our results of\noperations may be adversely affected by our efforts to comply with the laws of other countries, as well as U.S. laws which apply to\ninternational operations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and U.S. export control laws.\nWe operate on a global basis with offices or activities in North America, Middle East and Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and\nSouth America. We face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and\nregulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and\ntrade restrictions, export control laws, and laws which prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or\nremunerations to customers, including the U.S. FCPA or other anti-corruption laws that have recently been the subject of a substantial\nincrease in global enforcement. Many of our products are subject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of\ncustomers to which our products may be sold, or require an export license in connection with sales outside the U.S. Given the high level of\ncomplexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example, through fraudulent\nor negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Also, we\nmay be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal\nsanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could\ninclude prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our\nbrand, our business, and our operating results. In addition, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant\ngovernmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local\ncustoms and practices. We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business,\nlicenses, or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other\nmethods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and\nmanage these difficulties. These factors or any combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue or our overall financial\nperformance.\nOur failure to maintain appropriate sustainability practices and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of customer\nand investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.\nGovernments, investors, customers, and employees are enhancing their focus on sustainability practices and disclosures, and\nexpectations in this area are rapidly evolving and increasing. While we monitor the various and evolving standards and associated reporting\nrequirements, failure to adequately maintain appropriate sustainability practices that meet diverse stakeholder expectations may result in the\nloss of business, reduced market valuation, an inability to attract customers, and an inability to attract and retain top talent.\nLegal or regulatory measures to address climate change, may negatively affect us.\nConcern over climate change can also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, such as taxation of, or caps on the use of, carbon-based energy.\nAny such new or additional legal or regulatory requirements may increase the costs associated with, or disrupt sourcing, manufacturing and\ndistribution of, our products which may adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nWe must comply with a variety of existing and future laws and regulations, such as sustainability initiatives, that could impose\nsubstantial costs on us and may adversely affect our business.\nIncreasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on sustainability matters. While we\nhave certain sustainability initiatives, there can be no assurance that regulators, customers, investors, and employees will determine that\nthese programs are sufficiently robust. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attain any announced goals related to\nour sustainability program, as statements regarding our sustainability goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees\nthat we will be able to achieve them within the timelines we announce or at all. Actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to our\nsustainability initiatives and reporting can impact our ability to hire and retain employees, increase our customer base, or attract and retain\ncertain types of investors. In addition, these parties are increasingly focused on specific disclosures and frameworks related to sustainability\nmatters. Collecting, measuring, and reporting sustainability information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming, is subject to\nevolving reporting standards, and can present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a\nmaterial impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Inadequate processes to collect and review this information prior to disclosure\ncould be subject to potential liability related to such information.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 18\nWe may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other businesses, technologies, and assets. These acquisition\nactivities may be unsuccessful or divert management’s attention.\nWe may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other businesses, technologies, and assets, and\nsuch acquisitions or investments are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:\n•the necessity of coordinating geographically disparate organizations;\n•implementing common systems and controls;\n•integrating personnel with diverse business and cultural backgrounds;\n•integrating acquired research and manufacturing facilities, technology and products;\n•combining different corporate cultures and legal systems;\n•unanticipated expenses related to integration, including technical and operational integration;\n•increased costs and unanticipated liabilities, including with respect to registration, environmental, health and safety matters, that\nmay affect sales and operating results;\n•retaining key employees;\n•obtaining required government and third-party approvals;\n•legal limitations in new jurisdictions;\n•installing effective internal controls and audit procedures;\n•issuing common stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders;\n•spending cash and incurring debt;\n•assuming contingent liabilities; and\n•creating additional expenses.\nWe may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or actually realize\nany anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or investments. Similarly, we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or\ninvestments on attractive terms. If we do complete acquisitions, we cannot ensure that they will ultimately strengthen our competitive or\nfinancial position or that they will not be viewed negatively by customers, financial markets, investors, or the media. In addition, the success\nof any acquisitions or investments also will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing\noperations.\nThe integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process and we may not\nrealize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions if we fail to successfully manage and operate the acquired\nbusiness. If we fail in any acquisition integration efforts and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization utilizing common\ninformation and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources practices, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to issue common stock or assume equity awards that dilute the ownership of\nour current stockholders, use a substantial portion of our cash resources, assume liabilities, record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets\nthat will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to\ncertain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.\nOur success depends, in part, on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including executive officers and other highly\nqualified employees, particularly when we undergo a leadership transition. Competition for these key personnel is intense. We cannot\nassure that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Losing\nany key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 19\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Geopolitical Conflicts\nUncertainty in the global geopolitical landscape and macro-economic environment may impact our operations outside the U.S.,\nincluding in the Middle East where many of our water megaprojects are planned.\nWe conduct our business on a global basis. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with a large percentage of our\nsales generated outside the U.S., specifically in the Middle East and Africa, and Asian markets which provide a significant portion of our total\nrevenue. Therefore, we are exposed to, and impacted by, global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies, and foreign\nexchange fluctuations. There is uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and globally characterized by the supply chain\nenvironment, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, and labor shortages. These global macroeconomic factors, coupled with the U.S.\npolitical climate, political unrest internationally, and known conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, have created global economic and political\nuncertainty, and have impacted demand for certain of our products. While the impact and longevity of these factors remains uncertain, we\nare constantly evaluating the extent to which these factors will impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Over the\nlong-term, demand for our energy recovery devices could correlate to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Any disruption to the\neconomic factors and regulations in these regions, which remain uncertain, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nIn addition, there is uncertainty as to the position the U.S. will take with respect to world affairs. This uncertainty may include such\nissues as the U.S. support for existing treaty and trade relationships with other countries, including, notably, China. This uncertainty, together\nwith other recent key global events, such as recently enacted currency control regulations and tariff regimes in or against China, ongoing\nterrorist activity, and hostilities in the Middle East, may adversely impact (i) the ability or willingness of non-U.S. companies to transact\nbusiness with U.S. companies, including with us; (ii) our ability to transact business in other countries, including the Middle East, where many\nof the water megaprojects are planned; (iii) regulation and trade agreements affecting U.S. companies; (iv) global stock markets (including\nThe NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite on which our common shares are traded); and (v) general global economic conditions.\nFurthermore, the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have resulted in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, and we\ncannot predict how these conflicts will evolve or their timing. If these conflicts continue for a significant time or further expand to other\ncountries or regions, they could have additional adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions that may have a direct adverse impact on our\nbusiness and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers in the broader region. All of these factors are outside of our control, but\nmay nonetheless cause us to adjust our strategy in order to compete effectively in global markets.\nRisks Related to Information Technology\nWe may have risks associated with security of our information technology systems.\nWe make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology systems and data. Despite significant\nefforts to create security barriers to such systems, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. Although we have sufficient\ncontrols in place, we have implemented additional enhanced security features and monitoring procedures. There is a risk of industrial\nespionage, cyberattacks, such as LOG4J, misuse or theft of information or assets, or damage to assets by people who may gain\nunauthorized access to our facilities, systems, or information. Such cybersecurity breaches, misuse, or other disruptions could lead to the\ndisclosure of confidential information, improper usage and distribution of our IP, theft, manipulation and destruction of private and proprietary\ndata, and production downtimes. Although we actively employ measures to prevent unauthorized access to our information systems,\npreventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is inherently difficult. These events could adversely affect our financial results and\nany legal action in connection with any such cybersecurity breach could be costly and time-consuming and may divert management’s\nattention and adversely affect the market’s perception of us and our products. In addition, we must frequently expand our internal information\nsystem to meet increasing demand in storage, computing and communication, which may result in increased costs. Our internal information\nsystem is expensive to expand and must be highly secure due to the sensitive nature of our customers’ information that we transmit. Building\nand managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on our management and resources. These demands may\ndivert these resources from the continued growth of our business and implementation of our business strategy.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 20\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nA wide variety of provincial, state, national, foreign, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention,\nprotection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are\nevolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new\nor different interpretations. Further, our legal and regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions are subject to unexpected changes, including\nthe potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior\nlaws or regulations, or to increase penalties significantly. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can delay or impede\nthe development and offering of new products and services.\nFor example, the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018, imposes more stringent data protection\nrequirements, and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance, than the European Union laws that previously applied.\nAdditionally, California recently enacted legislation, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which amends the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act. The CPRA took effect on January 1, 2023, and enforcement began on July 1, 2023. We may be subject to additional\nobligations relating to personal data by contract that industry standards apply to our practices. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with\napplicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from\nunauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for\ndamages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Further, evolving and changing definitions of personal data\nand information, including the classification of internet protocol addresses, machine identification information, location data, and other\ninformation, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting business relationships and partnerships that\nmay involve the sharing or uses of data, and may require significant costs, resources, and efforts in order to comply.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our technology or enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, and\nwe could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and to protect our\ntechnology from copying by others. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality agreements with\nemployees and third parties, all of which may offer only limited protection. We hold a number of U.S. and counterpart international patents,\nand when their terms expire, we could become more vulnerable to increased competition. The protection of our IP in some countries may be\nlimited. While we have expanded our portfolio of patent applications, we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will\nresult in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents are issued, they\nmay be contested, circumvented, or invalidated. Moreover, while we believe our issued patents and patent pending applications are\nessential to the protection of our technology, the rights granted under any of our issued patents or patents that may be issued in the future\nmay not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop\nsimilar or superior technologies now or in the future. In addition, our granted patents may not prevent misappropriation of our technology,\nparticularly in foreign countries where IP laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as those in the U.S. This may render our patents\nimpaired or useless and ultimately expose us to currently unanticipated competition. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our products,\ntrademarks, and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult, and in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to\nenforce or defend our IP rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. IP litigation could result in substantial\ncosts and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 21\nClaims by others that we infringe their proprietary rights could harm our business.\nThird parties could claim that our technology infringes their IP rights. In addition, we or our customers may be contacted by third\nparties suggesting that we obtain a license to certain of their IP rights that they may believe we are infringing. We expect that infringement\nclaims against us may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur. In addition, to the\nextent that we gain greater visibility, we believe that we will face a higher risk of being the subject of IP infringement claims. Any claim of\ninfringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could\ndistract management from our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us\nto pay substantial damages. A judgment against us could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering\nour products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such IP, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and\nexpense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could seriously harm our business. Third parties may also assert\ninfringement claims against our customers. Because we generally indemnify our customers if our products infringe the proprietary rights of\nthird parties, any such claims would require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on their behalf in one or more jurisdictions,\nregardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers.\nRisks Related to Tax and Governmental Regulations\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other corporate\ntax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting\nprinciples, or interpretations thereof. In addition, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) enacted in 2017, made significant changes to\nthe taxation of U.S. business entities that may have a meaningful impact to our provision for income taxes. These changes included a\nreduction to the federal corporate income tax rate, the current taxation of certain foreign earnings, the imposition of base-erosion prevention\nmeasures which may limit the deduction of certain transfer pricing payments, foreign derived intangible income deductions, capitalization of\nR&D expenses beginning in the 2022 tax year, and possible limitations on the deductibility of net interest expense or corporate debt\nobligations. The U.S. Department of the Treasury continues to issue regulations that affect various components of the Tax Act. Our future\neffective tax rate may be impacted by changes in interpretation of the regulations, as well as additional legislation and guidance regarding the\nTax Act.\nIn addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and\nmodernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax\nincentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding\ntreatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which\ncould also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies or rulings may also result in the taxes we\npreviously paid being subject to change.\nDue to the scale of our international business activities any substantial changes in international corporate tax policies, enforcement\nactivities or legislative initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our\nfinancial condition and results of operations generally.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 22\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could\nadversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances\ncould be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, the Tax Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic\nSecurity Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to such legislation may affect us, and certain aspects thereof could be repealed or\nmodified in future legislation. The current administration and Congress periodically make and propose tax law changes, some of which could\nhave an adverse effect on our operations, cash flows, and results of operations, and contribute to overall market volatility. In addition, it is\nuncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net\ndeferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Act or future\nreform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could\nincrease our future U.S. tax expense.\nThe U.S. Congress may make substantial changes to fiscal, regulation and other federal policies that may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in general economic conditions in the U.S. or other regions could adversely affect our business. There have been, and\nthere may be, significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. While it is not possible to\npredict whether and when any such changes will occur, changes at the local, state or federal level could impact our business. Specific\nlegislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, modifications to international trade\npolicy; public company reporting requirements; and environmental regulation.\nWe cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other countries,\nwhat products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. Accordingly, it is difficult to\npredict how such actions may impact our business, or the business of our customers. Our business operations, as well as the businesses of\nour customers on which we are substantially dependent, are located in various countries at risk for escalating trade disputes, including\nthe U.S. and China. Any resulting trade wars could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and could adversely impact our\nrevenues, gross margins and business operations.\nRisks Related to our Internal Controls\nChanges in the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles could adversely affect our financial results and may require\nsignificant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These\nprinciples are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret\nand create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. The FASB periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics.\nThese and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or\ncould result in variability of our financial results.\nWe are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and publicly disclose material\nweaknesses in our controls. Any adverse results from such evaluation may adversely affect investor perception, and our stock\nprice.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting and to disclose in our filing if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or\ndetected in a timely manner. We have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes\nin business needs, implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with\nthese requirements. If in the future, our internal controls over financial reporting are determined to be not effective resulting in a material\nweakness or significant deficiency, investor perceptions regarding the reliability of our financial statements may be adversely affected which\ncould cause a decline in the market price of our stock and otherwise negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 23\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nInsiders and principal stockholders will likely have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers, and other principal stockholders beneficially own, in the aggregate, a substantial amount of our\noutstanding common stock. These stockholders could likely have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\nincluding the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company, or our\ncompany’s assets.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to fluctuations. Changes in the\nstock market generally, as it concerns our industry, as well as geopolitical, economic, and business factors unrelated to us, may also affect\nour stock price. Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability\nto recruit and retain key employees, reduce our access to debt or equity capital, and otherwise harm our business or financial condition. In\naddition, we may not be able to use our common stock effectively as consideration in connection with any future acquisitions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control\nof our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a\nchange of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws\ninclude provisions that:\n•authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated\npreferred stock;\n•require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written\nconsent;\n•specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairman of the board, the\nchief executive officer, or the president;\n•establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders,\nincluding proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n•provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n•provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, even though less\nthan a quorum;\n•specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n•require a super-majority of votes to amend certain of the above-mentioned provisions.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers.\nSection 203 generally prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder subject to certain exceptions.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the\ntrading value of our securities.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies. Shareholder activists frequently propose\nto involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the company. Such proposals may disrupt our business and\ndivert the attention of our Board of Directors, management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction\nresulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, interfere with our ability to execute our strategic\nplan, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain\nqualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. A proxy contest for the election of directors at our\nannual meeting could also require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. In addition, actions of activist\nshareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that\ndo not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 24\nOur shareholders may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nIn the future, we may offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our\ncommon stock in order to raise additional capital. We cannot assure our shareholders that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in\nany other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share our shareholders paid for our shares.

This integration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our\ndecision-making processes at every level. Our Risk Management Team (see “Management’s Role Managing Risk” below for details\nregarding the team members and scope) works closely with our Information Technology (“IT”) team to continuously evaluate and address\ncybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs.\nEngage Third-parties on Risk Management\nRecognizing the complexity and evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, we engage with a range of external experts, including\ncybersecurity consultants in evaluating and testing our risk management systems. These partnerships enable us to leverage specialized\nknowledge and insights, ensuring our cybersecurity strategies and processes remain at the forefront of industry best practices. Our\ncollaboration with these third-parties includes regular audits, threat assessments, and consultation on security enhancements.\nOversee Third-party Risk\nBecause we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, we have implemented stringent processes to oversee\nand manage these risks. We conduct thorough security assessments of all third-party providers before engagement and maintain ongoing\nmonitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards. The monitoring includes an initial assessment by our Director, Information\nTechnology and IT team, and on an ongoing basis of a few key high-risk third-party systems by our security engineers. We also rely upon\ncertain third-party system providers, including cloud and non-cloud programs provided by software developers such as Microsoft Corporation,\nBlackline Systems, Inc., Workiva, Inc., and others, to review and notify their customers of any data breach. This approach, both internal and\nreliance on external review notification, is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third-\nparties.\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\nWhile we have a cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the integrity of our information systems, we also maintain\ncybersecurity insurance to manage potential liabilities resulting from specific cyber-attacks. However, it's important to note that although we\nmaintain cybersecurity insurance, there can be no guarantee that our insurance coverage limits will protect against any future claims or that\nsuch insurance proceeds will be paid to us in a timely manner. As of December 31, 2023, no risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a\nresult of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, us, including our business\nstrategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 25\nGovernance\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) is acutely aware of the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats.\nThe Board has established oversight mechanisms to ensure effective governance in managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats\nbecause we recognize the significance of these threats to our operational integrity and stakeholder confidence.\nBoard of Directors Oversight\nThe Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”) is central to the Board’s oversight of cybersecurity risks and bears the\nprimary responsibility for this domain. The Audit Committee is composed of independent board members with diverse expertise and\nexperience which allows them to oversee cybersecurity risks effectively.\nManagement’s Role Managing Risk\nWe have an internal management team comprising of our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Chief Legal Officer (“CLO”), VP, Corporate\nController, Sr. Director, SEC Reporting, and Director, Information Technology (the “Risk Management Team”), that plays a pivotal role in\ninforming the Audit Committee on cybersecurity risks. The Director, Information Technology and IT team monitor cybersecurity risks and\nperform continual risk exercises and assessments. The Risk Management Team meets quarterly to discuss current security breaches and\nthreats, if any, and discuss new controls and results of the cybersecurity risk monitoring, exercises, and assessments. The Risk\nManagement Team provides comprehensive briefings to the Audit Committee on a regular basis, with a minimum frequency of once per year.\nThese briefings encompass a broad range of topics, including:\n•Current cybersecurity landscape and emerging threats;\n•Status of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies;\n•Incident reports and learnings from any cybersecurity events; and\n•Compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.\nIn addition to our scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee and the Risk Management Team maintain an ongoing dialogue regarding\nemerging or potential cybersecurity risks. Together, the Board receives updates on any significant developments in the cybersecurity\ndomain, ensuring the Board’s oversight is proactive and responsive. The Audit Committee actively participates in strategic decisions related\nto cybersecurity, offering guidance and approval for major initiatives. This involvement ensures that cybersecurity considerations are\nintegrated into our broader strategic objectives.\nRisk Management Personnel\nOur Director, Information Technology (our “IT Director”), who has a career of 23 years in IT, has in-depth working knowledge on IT\nsystems and data security, and his experience is instrumental in developing and executing our cybersecurity strategies. Our IT Director\nalong with the IT team, oversees our governance programs, tests our compliance with standards, remediates known risks, and leads our\nemployee cybersecurity risk training program. However, the primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our cybersecurity\nrisks rests with the Risk Management Team. The diverse background and experience of our Risk Management Team members are\ninstrumental in developing and executing our cybersecurity strategies and supplement the expertise of our IT Director with their\nunderstanding of the needs of our business.\nMonitor Cybersecurity Incidents\nOur IT Director and the IT team are continually informed about the latest developments in cybersecurity, including potential threats\nand innovative risk management techniques. This ongoing knowledge acquisition is crucial for the effective prevention, detection, mitigation,\nand remediation of cybersecurity incidents. Our IT Director and the IT team implement and oversee processes for the regular monitoring of\nour information systems. This includes the deployment of advanced security measures and regular system audits to identify potential\nvulnerabilities. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, our IT Director is equipped with a well-defined incident response plan. This plan\nincludes immediate actions to mitigate the impact and long-term strategies for remediation and prevention of future incidents.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 26\nReporting to Board of Directors\nOur IT Director, in his capacity, regularly informs the other Risk Management Team members of all aspects related to cybersecurity\nrisks and incidents. This ensures that various levels management are kept abreast of the cybersecurity posture and potential risks facing\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. Furthermore, significant cybersecurity matters, and strategic risk management decisions are escalated to the Audit\nCommittee, ensuring that the Audit Committee has comprehensive oversight and can provide guidance on critical cybersecurity issues.\nItem 2 — Properties\nThe table below presents details for each of our principal properties.

It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and\nrelated Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur reportable operating segments consist of the Water and Emerging Technologies segments. These segments are based on the\nindustries in which the technology solutions are sold, the type of energy recovery device or other technology sold and the related solution and\nservice or, in the case of emerging technologies, where revenues from new and/or potential devices utilizing our pressure exchanger\ntechnology can be brought to market. Other factors for determining the reportable operating segments include the manner in which\nmanagement evaluates the performance of the Company combined with the nature of the individual business activities. In addition, our\ncorporate operating expenses include expenditures in support of the water and emerging technologies segments, as well as R&D\nexpenditures applicable to potential future industry verticals, or enabling technologies that could benefit either or both existing business units.\nHighlights, Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nWe released our fourth annual Sustainability Report (formally referred to as our Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”)\nreport), which details our efforts to accelerate the environmental sustainability of our customers’ operations and enhance the management of\nsustainability issues in our own operations. Our Sustainability Report reports provide examples and data illustrating our products’ positive\nenvironmental impacts across the industries where we operate. We understand the importance of being a responsible corporate citizen and\nbelieve our sustainability objectives provide us with a strategic roadmap to become a more resilient business, as well as a way to maintain\nour competitive advantage. Our 2022 Sustainability Report (issued in September 2023) outlines our progress on those objectives and aligns\nto leading sustainability frameworks and reporting standards, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the\nSustainability Accounting Standards Board, as well as select disclosures from the Global Reporting Initiative and the Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures.\nAs a result of our sustainability efforts and reporting, in 2023, MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI”) upgraded the company from an\nESG rating of AA to its highest rating of AAA. MSCI’s evaluation recognizes Energy Recovery as one of the highest performing companies\nwithin the Industrial Machinery industry in MSCI’s All Company World Index, reflecting robust corporate governance and labor management\npractices and significant opportunities in clean technology.\nOur complete 2022 Sustainability Report can be found on our website at: https://energyrecovery.com/sustainability/.

Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with a\nlarge percentage of our sales generated outside the U.S., specifically in the Middle East and Asia markets which provide a significant portion\nof our total revenue. Therefore, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies\nand foreign exchange fluctuations. There is uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic factors in the U.S. and globally characterized by the\nsupply chain environment, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, and labor shortages. These global macroeconomic factors, coupled\nwith the U.S. political climate, political unrest internationally, and known conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, have created global\neconomic and political uncertainty, and have impacted demand for certain of our products. While the impact and longevity of these factors\nremains uncertain, we are constantly evaluating the extent to which these factors will impact our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nOver the long-term, demand for our energy recovery devices could correlate to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Any\ndisruption to the economic factors and regulations in these regions, which remain uncertain, may adversely affect our results of operations\nand financial condition.\nRefer to Part I, Item 1, “Business,” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these trends and\nother risks.\nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year\nended December 31, 2021, can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with\nthe SEC on February 23, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations\nwebsite (https://ir.energyrecovery.com).\nRevenue\nThere is no specific seasonality in our revenues to highlight that occurs throughout a calendar year.\nRevenue by Channel Customers\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n$ % of $ % of Change\nRevenue Revenue\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nMegaproject $ 83,665 65% $ 81,888 65% $ 1,777 2%\nOriginal equipment manufacturer 25,995 20% 28,858 23% (2,863 (10%)\n)\nAftermarket 18,689 15% 14,845 12% 3,844 26%\nTotal revenue $ 128,349 100% $ 125,591 100% $ 2,758 2%\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 31\nRevenue Attributable to Primary Geographical Markets by Segments.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nWater Emerging Total Water Emerging Total\nTechnologies Technologies\nMiddle East and Africa $ 76,437 $ 177 $ 76,614 $ 86,227 $ 94 $ 86,321\nAsia 30,500 — 30,500 24,777 — 24,777\nAmericas 15,048 153 15,201 8,544 34 8,578\nEurope 5,740 294 6,034 5,880 35 5,915\nTotal revenue $ 127,725 $ 624 $ 128,349 $ 125,428 $ 163 $ 125,591\nThe Megaproject (“MPD”) channel has been the main driver of our long-term growth as revenue from this channel benefits from a\ngrowing number of projects as well as an increase in the capacity of these projects in some cases. The change in revenue for the year\nended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year, was due primarily to customers’ project timing, and execution of these projects,\nspecifically in the Middle East and Africa (“MEA”) markets.\nThe Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) channel, where we sell into a wide variety of industries in the desalination, wastewater,\nand the refrigeration markets, contains projects smaller in size and of shorter duration compared to those projects in the MPD channel.\n•Desalination: The decrease in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year, by $6.3 million was\ndue primarily to timing of project shipments. Revenue was lower in the MEA channel, partially offset by an increase in revenue in\nthe Americas market.\n•Wastewater: The increase in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year, by $3.0 million, was\ndue primarily to growth within the Asian, European, and the Americas markets.\n•Emerging Technology: The increase in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year, by\n$0.6 million was due primarily to CO growth in the European and Americas markets.\n2\nThe Aftermarket (“AM”) channel revenue generally fluctuates from year-to-year depending on support and services rendered to our\ninstalled customer base. AM revenue is also dependent on our customers’ timing of product upgrades, and replenishment of spare parts and\nsupplies. Generally, the AM channel revenue trend has been increasing over time. The increase in revenue in the year ended December 31,\n2023, as compared to the prior year, by $3.8 million was due primarily to shipments to customers in the MEA, the Americas and the\nEuropean markets.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenues attributable to domestic and international sales as a percentage of total revenue are presented in the following table.

This increase was due primarily to higher employee costs and share-based compensation expense related to additional headcount,\nand increased wages and benefit costs in G&A, S&M and R&D. Other non-employee costs included:\n•G&A: higher consultant costs, professional fees related to management projects, and CEO and board member search fees;\n•S&M: higher marketing expenses to further develop the CO market, an increase in outside commission costs and higher\n2\nsoftware licensing and support costs, partially offset by lower consultant costs, and a litigation settlement cost that occurred in\n2022 with no comparable cost in the current year;\n•R&D: an increase in CO product development costs, offset by expenses incurred in 2022 with no comparable costs in the\n2\ncurrent year, such as VorTeq-related accelerated depreciation expense of certain assets and employee severance costs.\nWater Segment. Water segment operating expenses increased by $3.5 million, or 16.0%, in the year ended December 31, 2023, as\ncompared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to higher employee costs, including share-based compensation expense, in\nG&A, S&M and R&D to support our existing desalination operations and our growth in wastewater, and an increase in marketing costs,\npartially offset by lower product development costs. The increase in employee costs was due primarily to an increase in headcount, and\nhigher wage and benefit costs. In addition, in 2022, we incurred a litigation settlement cost with no comparable cost in the current year.\nEmerging Technologies Segment. Emerging Technologies operating expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 8.7%, in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to higher employee costs, and share-based\ncompensation expense, related to an increase in headcount in G&A, S&M and R&D, an increase in travel and marketing costs to further\ndevelop the CO market, and an increase in R&D costs to further develop our CO product. This increase was partially offset by VorTeq-\n2 2\nrelated accelerated depreciation expense of certain assets and employee severance costs incurred in 2022 with no comparable amounts in\nthe current year.\nCorporate Operating Expenses. Corporate operating expenses increased by $0.1 million, or 0.7%, in the year ended December 31,\n2023, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to higher consultant costs, an increase in CEO and board member\nsearch fees, and higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower employee compensation costs, and a decrease in\nsoftware and licensing costs.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 34\nOther Income, Net\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nInterest income $ 3,756 $ 908\nOther non-operating (expense) income, net (101 334\n)\nTotal other income, net $ 3,655 $ 1,242\nThe increase in Total other income, net in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year, was due primarily to an\nincrease in interest yields on our investments as well as an increase in investments in investment-grade marketable debt instruments.\nIncome Taxes\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nProvision for income taxes $ 1,201 $ 2,022 $ (821\n)\nEffective tax rate 5% 8%\nThe lower provision for income taxes in 2023, as compared to the prior year, was due primarily to a decrease in income from\noperations, an increase in tax benefit of $0.6 million related to Foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”), and an increase of $0.3 million in\nR&D tax credits, partially offset by lower share-based compensation related windfalls of $0.7 million.\nThe fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate included a benefit of $2.4 million related to FDII, a benefit of $1.3 million related to R&D tax\ncredits, and a benefit of $0.7 million related to tax deductions from stock-based compensation related windfalls.\nThe fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate included a benefit of $1.8 million related to related to FDII, a benefit of $1.3 million related to tax\ndeductions from stock-based compensation related windfalls, and a benefit of $1.0 million related to R&D tax credits.\nSee Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes for further discussion regarding further information related to our tax rate reconciliation.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 35\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nFrom time-to-time, management and our Board of Directors review our liquidity and future cash needs and may make a decision to\n(1) return capital to our shareholders through a share repurchase program or dividend payout; or (2) seek additional debt or equity financing.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of (i) unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $68.1 million;\n(ii) investment-grade short-term and long-term marketable debt instruments of $54.3 million that are primarily invested in U.S. treasury\nsecurities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal and agency notes and bonds; and (iii) accounts receivable, net of allowances, of\n$46.9 million. As of December 31, 2023, there was unrestricted cash of $1.2 million held outside the U.S. We invest cash not needed for\ncurrent operations predominantly in investment-grade, marketable debt instruments with the intent to make such funds available for future\noperating purposes, as needed. Although these securities are available for sale, we generally hold these securities to maturity, and\ntherefore, do not currently see a need to trade these securities in order to support our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future. We believe\nthe risk of this portfolio to us is in the ability of the underlying companies to cover their obligations at maturity, not in our ability to trade these\nsecurities at a profit. Based on current projections, we believe existing cash balances and future cash inflows from this portfolio will meet our\nliquidity needs for at least the next 12 months.\nShort-term Contract Assets\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $0.6 million of short-term contract assets which represents unbilled trade receivables from certain\nWater segment contract sales which include contractual holdback provisions, pursuant to which we will invoice the final retention payment\ndue within the next 12 months. The customer holdbacks represent amounts intended to provide a form of security for the customer; and\naccordingly, these contract assets have not been discounted to present value.\nCredit Agreement\nWe entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMC”) on December 22, 2021 (“Credit Agreement”) to\nprovide us with additional capital to fuel our growth and expansion into emerging markets utilizing our pressure exchanger technology. The\nCredit Agreement, which will expire on December 21, 2026, provides a committed revolving credit line of $50.0 million and includes both a\nrevolving loan and a letters of credit (“LCs”) component. During September 2023, the Company and JPMC amended the Credit Agreement\n(the “Second Amendment”) to only increase the maximum allowable LCs credit line component from $25.0 million to $30.0 million. No other\ncomponents or features under the Credit Agreement (including the First Amendment dated July 15, 2022) were amended. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, as of December 31, 2023, there were no revolving loans outstanding. In addition, as of December 31,\n2023, under the LCs component, we utilized $21.8 million of the maximum allowable credit line of $30.0 million, which included newly\nissued LCs, and previously issued and unexpired stand-by letters of credits (“SBLCs”) and certain non-expired commitments under the\nprevious Loan and Pledge Agreement with Citibank, N.A., which are guaranteed under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2023,\nthere was $19.9 million of outstanding LCs. These LCs had a weighted average remaining life of approximately 14 months.\nSee Note 6, “Lines of Credit,” of the Notes for further discussion related to the Credit Agreement.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 36\nCash Flows\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 26,054 $ 12,631 $ 13,423\nNet cash used in investing activities (19,114 (6,946 (12,168\n) ) )\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 4,794 (23,668 28,462\n)\nEffect of exchange rate differences on cash and cash equivalents 33 (20 53\n)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 11,767 $ (18,003 $ 29,770\n)\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities is subject to the project driven, non-cyclical nature of our business. Operating cash flow can\nfluctuate significantly from year to year, due to the timing of receipts of large project orders. Operating cash flow may be negative in one year\nand significantly positive in the next, consequently individual quarterly results and comparisons may not necessarily indicate a significant\ntrend, either positive or negative.\nThe lower net cash used for operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year,\nwas due primarily to the following factors:\n•an increase in cash related to an increase in revenues and the timing of collections on accounts receivable balances in 2023;\n•lower cash used for inventory builds. In 2022, cash used for inventory builds was higher due to the additional purchases of raw\nmaterial to mitigate supply risk and building of finished goods inventory to satisfy future projects; and\n•an increase in accounts payables related to the timing of vendor payments.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities primarily relates to sales, maturities and purchases of investment-grade marketable debt\ninstruments, such as corporate notes and bonds, and capital expenditures supporting our growth. We believe our investments in marketable\ndebt instruments are structured to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing\nrisk. The higher $12.2 million in net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the prior year,\nwas driven by a $12.8 million increase in net cash used for investments in marketable debt instruments, partially offset by lower cash used for\ncapital expenditures.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities primarily relates to the share repurchases under our board authorized share\nrepurchase program, which was completed in 2022, and by issuance of equity from our equity incentive plans. The cash provided by\nfinancing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the cash used in financing activities in the prior year, was due\nprimarily to higher cash from issuance of equity from our equity incentive plans, offset by share repurchases of $26.7 million in 2022 under\nthe March 2021 Authorization, as discussed in Note 11, “Stockholders’ Equity – Share Repurchase Program,” of the Notes.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 37\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nWe believe that our existing resources and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital\nrequirements for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to continue\nto fund our operations or to support acquisitions in the future and/or to fund investments in our latest technology arising from rapid market\nadoption. These needs could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Our future capital requirements will depend on many\nfactors including the continuing market acceptance of our products, our rate of revenue growth, the timing of new product introductions, the\nexpansion of our R&D, manufacturing and S&M activities, and the timing and extent of our expansion into new geographic territories. In\naddition, we may enter into potential material investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies in the\nfuture which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Should we need additional liquidity or capital funds, these funds\nmay not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nFacility and Equipment Leases. We lease facilities and equipment under fixed noncancelable operating leases that expire on various\ndates through fiscal year 2030. See Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies – Operating Lease Obligations,” of the Notes for additional\ninformation related to our fixed noncancelable operating leases.\nPurchase Order Arrangements. We have purchase order arrangements with our vendors for which we have not received the related\ngoods or services. These arrangements are subject to change based on our sales demand forecasts. We have the right to cancel the\narrangements prior to the date of delivery. The purchase order arrangements are related to various raw materials and component parts, as\nwell as capital equipment. See Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies – Purchase Obligations,” of the Notes for additional information\nrelated to our purchase order arrangements.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements. During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or\nfinancial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established\nfor the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make\nestimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial\nStatements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods presented. We believe that the estimates and\njudgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and\njudgments. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial results\nwill be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical\nto aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are revenue recognition; valuation of stock options; valuation and\nimpairment of goodwill; inventory; and deferred taxes and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\nThe following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies or estimates. See Note 1, “Description of\nBusiness and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes for further detailed discussion regarding our accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects\nthe consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. At the inception of each contract, performance\nobligations are identified and the total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations. Our contracts with customers may\ninclude multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative\nstand-alone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers. With respect to\ntermination, we do not have the ability to cancel a contract for convenience. In general, customers can cancel for convenience upon the\npayment of a termination fee that covers costs and profit. It is rare for customers to cancel contracts. See Note 1, “Description of Business\nand Significant Accounting Policies – Significant Accounting Policies – Revenue Recognition (Product and Service Revenue Recognition),” of\nthe Notes for more detail on product and service revenue recognition.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 38\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for share-based compensation according to U.S. GAAP relating to share-based payments, which requires the\nmeasurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated\nfair values on the grant date. The fair value of stock options is calculated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes (also referred to as the\n“Black-Scholes-Merton”) model, which requires a number of complex assumptions including the expected life to exercise a vested award\nbased upon the Company’s exercise history, expected volatility based upon the Company’s historical stock prices, risk-free interest rate\nbased upon the U.S. Treasury rates, and the Company’s dividend yield. See Note 1, “Description of Business and Significant Accounting\nPolicies – Significant Accounting Policies – Stock-based Compensation” and Note 12, “Stock-based Compensation,” of the Notes for further\ndiscussion of our accounting policy and stock-based compensation activities, respectively.\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nGoodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates, including, but not limited to, the determination of (i) the\nnumber of reporting units, (ii) the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and (iii) the fair values of the\nreporting units. The estimates and assumptions described above, along with other factors such as discount rates, will significantly affect the\noutcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses. We perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill for\nimpairment on an annual basis during the third quarter of each year, and between annual tests, a qualitative assessment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If these interim qualitative factors were to indicate that it\nis more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we would then perform a quantitative assessment,\nwhich would consist primarily of a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. To the\nextent the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s allocated goodwill exceeds the unit’s fair value, we recognize an impairment of goodwill for\nthe excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. See Note 1, “Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies –\nSignificant Accounting Policies – Goodwill” and Note 4, “Other Financial Information – Goodwill,” of the Notes for further discussion of our\naccounting policy and goodwill activities, respectively.\nInventories\nWe determine at each balance sheet date how much, if any, of our inventory may ultimately prove to be either unsalable or unsalable\nat its carrying cost. Reserves are established to effectively adjust the carrying value of such inventory to lower of cost (first-in, first-out\nmethod) or net realizable value. See Note 1, “Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies – Significant Accounting Policies –\nInventories” and Note 4, “Other Financial Information – Inventories, net,” of the Notes for further discussion of our accounting policy and\nestimates, and inventory activities, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income and the jurisdictions where it is earned, statutory tax rates, and the tax\nimpacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are\njudgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions. We\nare subject to complex tax laws, in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and the manner in which they apply can be open to\ninterpretation. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction in\nfuture periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities, and expectations about future outcomes. Our assessment relies on\nestimates and assumptions, and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. We use an estimate of our annual effective\ntax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time, while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at\nyear-end. See Note 1, “Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies – Significant Accounting Policies – Income Taxes” and\nNote 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes for further discussion of our income tax policy and our tax valuation allowance, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1, “Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies – Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet\nAdopted,” of the Notes.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 39\nItem 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur exposure to market risk may be found primarily in two areas, foreign currency and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur foreign currency exposures are due to fluctuations in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar (“USD”) versus the British pound, Saudi\nriyal, Emirati dirham, European euro, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee and Canadian dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates could adversely\naffect our consolidated operating results or financial position.\nOur revenue contracts have been denominated in the USD. At times, our international customers may have difficulty in obtaining\nthe USD to pay our receivables, thus increasing collection risk and potential bad debt expense. To the extent we expand our international\nsales, a larger portion of our revenue could be denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, our cash and operating results could be\nincreasingly affected by changes in exchange rates.\nIn addition, we pay many vendors in foreign currency and, therefore, are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our\ninternational sales and service operations incur expense that is denominated in foreign currencies. This expense could be materially affected\nby currency fluctuations. Our international sales and services operations also maintain cash balances denominated in foreign currencies. To\ndecrease the inherent risk associated with translation of foreign cash balances into our reporting currency, we do not maintain excess cash\nbalances in foreign currencies.\nWe have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because expenses in foreign currencies have been\ninsignificant to date and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, we do not\nhave any exposure to the Russian ruble.\nInterest Rate and Credit Risks\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without\nsignificantly increasing risk. We invest primarily in investment-grade short-term and long-term marketable debt instruments that are subject\nto counter-party credit risk. To minimize this risk, we invest pursuant to an investment policy approved by our board of directors. The policy\nmandates high credit rating requirements and restricts our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio of $54.3 million, in investment-grade marketable debt instruments, such as U.S.\ntreasury securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal and agency notes and bonds, are classified as either short-term and/or long-\nterm investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are subject to interest rate fluctuations and decrease in market\nvalue to the extent interest rates increase, which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023. To minimize the exposure due to\nadverse shifts in interest rates, we maintain investments with a weighted average maturity of approximately nine months. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would have resulted in a less than $0.3 million decrease in the fair value of\nour investments in marketable debt instruments as of such date.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 40\nItem 8 — Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nPage No.\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. 34) 42\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets — December 31, 2023 and 2022 45\nConsolidated Statements of Operations — Years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 46\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income — Years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 47\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity — Years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 48\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows — Years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 49\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 50\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 41\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Energy Recovery, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Energy Recovery, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash\nflows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21,\n2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our\naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide\na reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition — Refer to Notes 1, 2 and 10 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of products which typically follows transfer of title upon shipment or delivery in accordance\nwith International Commercial Terms. The processing and recording of the Company’s revenue transactions is a combination of automated\nand manual processes (i.e., the revenue transactions are recorded automatically upon invoice generation at the time of shipment, whereas\nthe review process remains relatively manual to ensure control has properly transferred to recognize revenue) and therefore, the Company\nuses a precise set of procedures to ensure revenue is accurate for each transaction.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 42\nWe identified the Company’s revenue recognition processes as a critical audit matter as the Company has a significant volume of product\nrevenue transactions throughout the year and a manual process to generate accurate data to process and record revenue in line with when\nrisk is transferred to the customers. This required an increased extent of effort to audit these revenue transactions.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to revenue recognition included the following, among others:\n•We tested the effectiveness of controls over the recognition of revenue.\n•We obtained an understanding of the nature of the revenue recognition process through inquiry with the Company personnel\nresponsible for the invoices as well as review of the contract with the customers.\n•For a sample of processed revenue transactions, we traced and agreed the calculation of the Company’s recorded revenue and\nthe timing of revenue recognition to source documents such as the agreed upon terms with the customer and shipping records,\nas well as the related invoices generated within the system and evaluated any differences.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 21, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 43\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Energy Recovery, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Energy Recovery, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,\n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nCOSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2024,\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our\naudit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 21, 2024\nTable of Contents\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report |

Significant Accounting Policies\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Energy Recovery”) designs and manufactures reliable,\nhigh-performance solutions that provide cost savings through improved energy efficiency in commercial and industrial processes, with\napplications across several industries. Leveraging the Company’s pressure exchanger technology, which generates little to no emissions\nwhen operating, the Company’s solutions lowers costs, saves energy, reduces waste, and minimizes emissions for companies across a\nvariety of industrial processes. As the world coalesces around the urgent need to address climate change and its impacts, the Company is\nhelping companies reduce their energy consumption in their industrial processes, which in turn, reduces their carbon footprint. The Company\nbelieves that its customers do not have to sacrifice quality and cost savings for sustainability and is committed to developing solutions that\ndrive long-term value – both financial and environmental. The Company’s solutions are marketed, sold in, or developed for, the fluid-flow and\ngas markets, such as seawater and wastewater desalination, natural gas, chemical processing and CO-based refrigeration systems, under\n2\nthe trademarks ERI®, PX®, Pressure Exchanger®, PX® Pressure Exchanger® (“PX”), Ultra PX™, PX G™, PX G1300™, PX PowerTrain™, AT™,\nand Aquabold™. The Company owns, manufactures and/or develops its solutions, in whole or in part, in the United States of America (the\n“U.S.”).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Energy Recovery, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified in certain notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the\ncurrent period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”),\nrequires the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and accompanying notes.\nThe accounting policies that reflect the Company’s significant estimates and judgments and that the Company believes are the most\ncritical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results are revenue recognition; valuation of stock options; useful life\nand valuation of equipment; valuation and impairment of goodwill; deferred taxes and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets; and\nevaluation and measurement of contingencies. Those estimates could change, and as a result, actual results could differ materially from\nthose estimates.\nThe Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a\nrevision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of February 21, 2024, the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly these estimates for any\nreason after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as required by law.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 50\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining contractual maturity on date of purchase of less\nthan or equal to three months to be classified and presented as cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash equivalents are\nstated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents may include demand deposit accounts with large\nfinancial institutions, institutional money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal and agency notes\nand bonds. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of the financial institutions, institutional money market funds, and corporations in\nwhich the Company invests its surplus funds. The Company has experienced no credit losses from its cash investments.\nShort-term and Long-term Investments\nThe Company’s short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of investment-grade debt securities, such as U.S. treasury\nsecurities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal and agency notes and bonds, all of which are classified as available-for-sale.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. Amortization or accretion of premium or discount is included in other income (expense)\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses on the\nsale of available-for-sale securities are determined by specific identification of the cost basis of each security.\nThe Company categorizes and classifies short-term and long-term available-for-sale investments on the Company’s Consolidated\nBalance Sheets as follows:\n•Short-term investments: Investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at time of purchase greater than three\nmonths and that are expected to mature within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments\nand are presented in current assets.\n•Long-term investments: Investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity at time of purchase greater than three\nmonths and that are expected to mature more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term\ninvestments and are presented in non-current assets.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company records a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and an estimate of the expected credit losses.\nIn estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers, among other factors, the aging of the accounts receivable, its\nhistorical write-offs, the credit worthiness of each customer, and general economic conditions. Account balances are charged off against the\nallowance when the Company believes that it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. Actual write-offs may be in excess of the\nCompany’s estimated allowance.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out “FIFO” method) or net realizable value. The Company calculates\ninventory valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory based on current inventory levels, movement, expected useful lives, and\nestimated future demand of the products and spare parts.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 51\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and reduced by accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. The following table presents the estimated useful life, or range of useful\nlives, of the Company’s property and equipment. Maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred.\nMinimum Maximum\nMachinery and equipment (excluding equipment used for manufacturing of ceramic components)) 3 years 7 years\nMachinery and equipment used for manufacturing of ceramic components 3 years 10 years\nLeasehold improvements (1) 1 year 5.5 years\nSoftware (2) 3 years 5 years\nOffice equipment, furniture, and fixtures 3 years 5 years\nAutomobiles 1 year 7 years\n(1)Leasehold improvements represent remodeling and retrofitting costs for leased office and manufacturing space and are depreciated over the shorter of\neither the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease. See Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies-Operating Lease Obligations, for further\ndiscussion of lease terms.\n(2)Software purchased for internal use consists primarily of amounts paid for perpetual licenses to third-party software providers and implementation\ncosts.\nEstimated useful lives are periodically reviewed, and when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or\nchanges in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of\nthe carrying amounts. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to\nestimated future net undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset (asset group). If such assets are considered to be impaired, the\nimpairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The\nevaluation of recoverability involves estimates of future operating cash flows based upon certain forecasted assumptions, including, but not\nlimited to, revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, and operating expenses.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluates\nwhether the lease is an operating or a finance lease at the commencement date. The Company recognizes right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and\nlease liabilities for operating leases with terms greater than 1 year. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an asset for the lease\nterm, while lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are\nrecognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The Company uses the\nimplicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, its incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the\npresent value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company’s unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the\neffects of collateral. Operating lease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives. Based on materiality, the\nCompany accounts for both the non-lease components and related lease components as a single lease component. Lease terms may\ninclude options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company applies lease modifications that change the contractual terms and conditions of a lease, that were not part of the\noriginal lease, and grants additional right of use with a price consistent with the market, as a new lease. These modifications will be\nassessed in compliance with the above parameters. For other types of lease modification, the modified lease is reassessed and all new\nassumptions are applied in the calculation of the updated lease liability and the ROU asset.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 52\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is evaluated annually (July 1) for impairment at the reporting unit level or when indicators of a potential\nimpairment are present. Goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates, including, but not limited to,\nthe determination of (i) the number of reporting units, (ii) the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and\n(iii) the fair values of the reporting units. The estimates and assumptions described above, along with other factors such as discount rates,\nwill significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses. We perform a quantitative\nassessment of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the third quarter of each year, which would consist primarily of a discounted\ncash flow (“DCF”) analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. The forecast of future cash flows, which is based on the\nCompany’s best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, is based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market\nsegment, and general economic conditions. In addition, the Company incorporates other significant inputs to its fair value calculations,\nincluding discount rate and market multiples, to reflect current market conditions. Between annual tests, a qualitative assessment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If these interim qualitative factors were to\nindicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we would then perform a\nquantitative assessment. To the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s allocated goodwill exceeds the unit’s fair value, we\nrecognize an impairment of goodwill for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, investments in marketable securities,\naccounts receivable, and accounts payable. The carrying amounts for these financial instruments reported in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets approximate their fair values. See Note 5, “Investments and Fair Value Measurements,” for further discussion related to fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Performance obligations are\nidentified and the total transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations at execution of the contract.\nThe Company’s payment terms vary based on the credit risk of its customer. For certain customer types, the Company requires\npayment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. The Company performs an evaluation of customer credit worthiness\non an individual contract basis to assess whether collectability is reasonably assured at the inception of the contract. As part of this\nevaluation, the Company considers many factors about the individual customer, including the underlying financial strength of the customer\nand/or partnership consortium and the Company’s prior history or industry-specific knowledge about the customer and its supplier\nrelationships. For smaller projects, the Company requires the customer to remit payment generally within 30 to 60 days after product\ndelivery. In some cases, if credit worthiness cannot be determined, prepayment or other security is required.\nSales commissions are expensed as incurred when product revenue is earned. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing\nexpenses.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations and Termination for Convenience\nThe Company’s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company\nallocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative stand-alone selling price. The Company generally determines stand-\nalone selling prices based on stand-alone observable sales to customers.\nWith respect to termination, the Company does not have the ability to cancel the contract for convenience. In general, customers can\ncancel for convenience upon the payment of a termination fee that covers costs and profit.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThe time period between when the Company transfers control of products to the customer and the payment for the products is, in\ngeneral, less than one year and, therefore, the practical expedient with respect to a financing component has been adopted by the Company.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 53\nWith respect to taxes, the Company has made the policy election to exclude taxes from the measurement of the transaction price.\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of\none year or less; and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice\nfor services performed.\nContract Costs\nThe Company recognizes the incremental cost of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the\nassets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The costs of obtaining contracts are included in sales and\nmarketing expenses.\nProduct and Service Revenue Recognition\nA contract is established by a written agreement (executed sales order, executed purchase order or stand-alone contract) with the\ncustomer with fixed pricing, and a credit risk assessment is completed prior to the signing of the agreement to ensure that collectability is\nreasonably assured.\nThe Company adheres to consistent pricing in the stand-alone sale of products and services. Performance obligations consist of\ndelivery of products, such as the Company’s PXs, hydraulic turbochargers, pumps and spare parts. Service obligations, such as\ncommissioning, which are not material, are deferred as contract liabilities until the services are performed.\nThe transfer of control for the Company’s products follows transfer of title which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery of the\nequipment in accordance with International Commercial Terms (commonly referred to as “incoterms”). The specified product performance\ncriteria for the Company’s products pertain to the ability of the Company’s product to meet its published performance specifications and\nwarranty provisions, which the Company’s products have demonstrated on a consistent basis. This factor, combined with historical\nperformance metrics, provides the Company’s management with a reasonable basis to conclude that the products will perform satisfactorily\nupon commissioning of the plant. Installation is relatively simple, requires no customization, and is performed by the customer under the\nsupervision of the Company’s personnel. Based on these factors, the Company concluded that performance has been completed upon\nshipment or delivery when title transfers based on the shipping terms, and that product revenue is recognized at a point in time.\nThe Company does not provide its customers with a right of product return; however, the Company will accept returns of products that\nare deemed to be damaged or defective when delivered that are covered by the terms and conditions of the product warranty. Product\nwarranty is provided consistent with the industry and is considered to be an assurance warranty, not a separate performance obligation.\nProduct returns and warranty charges have not been material.\nFor large projects, stand-alone contracts are utilized. For these contracts, consistent with industry practice, the Company’s customers\ntypically require their suppliers, including the Company, to accept contractual holdback provisions (also referred to as a retention payment)\nwhereby the final amounts due under the sales contract are remitted over extended periods of time or alternatively, stand-by letters of credit\nare issued. These retention payments are generally 10% or less of the total contract amount and are due and payable based upon the\ncontractual milestone billing, generally between 24 to 36 months from the date of product delivery. These retention payments with\nperformance conditions are recorded as contract assets and align with the product warranty period. Given that they are not material in the\ncontext of the contract, they are not considered to be a financing component.\nShipping and handling charges billed to customers are pass-through from the freight forwarder to the customer and are included in\nproduct revenue. The cost of shipping to customers is included in product cost of revenue.\nContracts are sometimes modified for a change in scope or other requirements. The Company considers contract modifications to\nexist when the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Any subsequent contract\nmodifications are analyzed to determine the treatment of the contract modification as a separate contract, prospectively or through a\ncumulative catch-up adjustment.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 54\nWarranty Costs\nThe Company sells products with a limited warranty for a period ranging from 18 months to five years. The Company accrues for\nwarranty costs based on estimated product failure rates, historical activity, and expectations of future costs. Periodically, the Company\nevaluates and adjusts the warranty costs to the extent that actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company measures and recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all stock-\nbased awards made to its employees, non-employee consultants and directors, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and incentive stock\noptions over the requisite service period (typically the vesting period of the awards). The fair value of RSUs is based on the Company’s\ncommon stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is calculated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes (also\nreferred to as the “Black-Scholes-Merton”) model, which requires a number of complex assumptions including the expected life to exercise a\nvested award based upon the Company’s exercise history, expected volatility based upon the Company’s historical stock prices, risk-free\ninterest rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates, and the Company’s dividend yield. The estimation of awards that will ultimately vest\nrequires judgment, and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from the Company’s current estimates, such amounts are\nrecorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimates are revised. See Note 12, “Stock-based Compensation,” for further\ndiscussion of stock-based compensation.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is their respective\nlocal currencies. The asset and liability accounts of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated from their local currencies at the rates\nin effect on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Gains\nand losses resulting from the translation of the Company’s subsidiary balance sheets are recorded as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recorded in other income (expense) in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncome Taxes\nCurrent and non-current tax assets and liabilities are based upon an estimate of taxes refundable or payable for each of the\njurisdictions in which the Company is subject to tax. In the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying income tax\npositions. The Company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the\nCompany’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more\nlikely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of\nbeing realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax\npositions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements.\nWhen applicable, associated interest and penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties\nare included within the related tax asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences arising from differences in bases of assets and liabilities for tax and\nfinancial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes are recorded on temporary differences using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in\nwhich the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is\nrecognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the\nopinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment\nis required in determining whether and to what extent any valuation allowance is needed on the Company’s deferred tax assets. In making\nsuch a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence including recent results of operations, scheduled\nreversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future income, and available tax planning strategies. See Note 8, “Income Taxes,” for further\ndiscussion of tax valuation allowances.\nThe Company’s operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Significant estimates\nand judgments are required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on\ninterpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. The ultimate amount of tax liability may be uncertain as a result.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 55\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-06,\nDisclosure Agreements - Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative\n(“ASU 2023-06”). The amendments in ASU 2023-06 will impact various disclosure areas, including the statement of cash flows, accounting\nchanges and error corrections, earnings per share, debt, equity, derivatives, and transfers of financial assets. The amendments in\nASU 2023-06 will be effective on the date the related disclosures are removed from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K by the Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”), and will no longer be effective if the SEC has not removed the applicable disclosure requirement by\nJune 30, 2027. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company does not believe the amendments in ASU 2023-06 will materially impact any of\nthe Company’s current disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 expands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment\nexpenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of\nsegment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable\nsegment’s profit or loss and assets. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 (i.e., the Company’s 2024\nAnnual Report) and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 (i.e., the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2025).\nEarly adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial\nstatements and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures\n(“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 was issued to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09\nis effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (i.e., the Company’s 2025 Annual Report) on a prospective basis; however,\nretrospective application is permitted. In addition, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the\nadoption of ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nNote 2 — Revenue\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company classifies its channel customers as follows:\n•Megaproject (“MPD”). MPD customers are major firms that develop, design, build, own and/or operate large-scale desalination\nplants or projects. Revenues from projects generally exceed $1.0 million and the MPD project timeline between project tender\nand shipment generally ranges from 16 to 36 months; however, from time-to-time, may exceed 36 months.\n•Original Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”). In addition to the type of customers listed below, revenues from projects generally\nare $1.0 million or less and the OEM project timeline from project tender to shipment generally ranges from one to 16 months;\nhowever, from time-to-time, may exceed 16 months.\n◦Water: OEM customers are companies that supply equipment, packaged systems, and various operating and\nmaintenance solutions for small to medium-sized desalination plants, utilized by commercial and industrial\nentities, as well as national, state and local municipalities worldwide.\n◦Emerging Technologies: OEM customers include direct sales to commercial or industrial customers, such as\nsupermarket chains, cold storage facilities, and other industrial users. Also, included are sales to\nintermediaries, such as refrigeration system installers or refrigeration original equipment manufacturers.\n•Aftermarket (“AM”). AM customers are desalination plant owners and/or operators who can utilize our technology to upgrade or\nkeep their plant running.

The Company monitors the industries in which it operates, and reviews its business performance for indicators of potential\nimpairment. The recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level, which represents the operating segment. The carrying\namount of goodwill as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $12.8 million.\nOn July 1, 2023, the Company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using both the discounted cash flow and market\napproaches. The forecast of future cash flows, which is based on the Company’s best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses,\nis based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment, and general economic conditions. The Company incorporates\nother significant inputs to its fair value calculations, including discount rate and market multiples, to reflect current market conditions.

Available-for-sale\ninvestments are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either short-term and/or long-term investments.\nThe classification of available-for-sale investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and definition of each of these classifications\nare presented in Note 1, “Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies - Significant Accounting Policies,” subsections “Cash\nand Cash Equivalents” and “Short-term and Long-term Investments.”\nExpected maturities can differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without\nprepayment penalties. The Company generally holds available-for-sale investments until maturity; however, from time-to-time, the Company\nmay elect to sell certain available-for-sale investments prior to contractual maturity.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures that, among other things, defines fair\nvalue, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category\nmeasured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement\nthat should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nAll of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are remeasured and reported at fair value at each reporting period, and are\nclassified and disclosed in one of the following three pricing category levels:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists, thereby requiring an entity to develop its own\nassumptions that market participants would use in pricing.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 62\nThe following table presents the Company’s financial assets measured on a recurring basis by contractual maturity, including pricing\ncategory, amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value.

(“JPMC”) on December 22, 2021 (“Credit\nAgreement”). The Credit Agreement, which will expire on December 21, 2026, provides a committed revolving credit line of $50.0 million.\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with various covenants, including among other things, financial covenants to\n1) maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA, not to exceed 3.0 to 1; and 2) limit annual capital expenditures.\nThe Credit Agreement allows the Company to, among other things, make distributions to shareholders, repurchase its stock, incur other debt\nor liens, or acquire or dispose of assets provided that the Company complies with certain requirements and limitations set forth in the Credit\nAgreement. The unused portion of the credit line is subject to a fee equal to 0.20% per annum multiplied by the amount of such unused\nportion.\nOn July 15, 2022, the Company and JPMC agreed to a modification of the Credit Agreement (“First Amendment”) to change the\nindicated reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR. Changes in the Credit Agreement reference rate to SOFR did not materially change the\nprovisions defined in the original Credit Agreement nor did this change materially affect the Company’s financial statements. During\nSeptember 2023, the Company and JPMC amended the Credit Agreement (the “Second Amendment”) to only increase the maximum\nallowable letters of credit (“LCs”) credit line component from $25.0 million to $30.0 million. No other components or features under the Credit\nAgreement (including the First Amendment dated July 15, 2022) were amended.\nRevolving Loans\nRevolving loans under the Credit Agreement may be in the form of 1) a base rate loan that bears interest equal to (a) the greater of\nthe Wall Street Journal prime rate and (b) the sum of (i) one-month reserve adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and\n(ii) 2.50%, plus an applicable margin of 0.25% or 0.50%, subject to the Company’s total leverage ratio, or 2) a Eurodollar loan that bears\ninterest equal to the sum of the reserved adjusted SOFR rate for an interest period elected by the Company, plus an applicable margin of\n1.25% or 1.50%, based upon the Company’s total leverage ratio. The Company may request loans up to the lower of a maximum exposure\nof $50.0 million or the amounts of unused credit under the Credit Agreement. The unused portion of the credit facility is subject to a facility\nfee in an amount equal to 0.20% per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line. At the election of the lender following an\nevent of default, the loans shall bear the aforementioned interest rate plus an additional 2%. As of December 31, 2023, there were no\nrevolving loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 64\nLetters of Credit\nUnder the Credit Agreement, the Company is allowed to request LCs up to the lower of a maximum exposure of $30.0 million or the\namounts of unused credit under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement does not require any cash collateral when LCs are issued;\nhowever, at the election of the lender following a default, the lender may require the Company to deposit cash in an amount equal to 103% of\nthe LCs exposure. LCs are subject to customary fees and expenses for issuance or renewal, and all disbursements are subject to the same\ninterest rate provision as noted directly above under Revolving Loans. LCs are limited to a term of one year, unless extended. Under the\nLCs component, the Company utilized $21.8 million of the maximum allowable credit line of $30.0 million, which includes newly issued LCs,\nand previously issued and unexpired stand-by letters of credits (“SBLCs”) and certain non-expired commitments under the Company’s\nprevious Loan and Pledge Agreement with Citibank, N.A. which are guaranteed under the Credit Agreement.\nThe following table presents the total outstanding LCs and SBLCs issued by the Company to our customers related to product\nwarranty and performance guarantees.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nOutstanding letters of credit $ 19,945 $ 15,487\nSee Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies – Guarantees,” for further discussion on product warranty and performance\nguarantees.\nNote 7 — Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Lease Obligations\nThe Company leases office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities under operating leases in San Leandro, CA, Tracy, CA and Katy,\nTX that expire on various dates through fiscal year 2030.

Under these provisions, the Company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the Company’s activities, generally limited to personal injury and property damage\ncaused by the Company’s employees at a customer’s plant, and in proportion to the employee’s percentage of fault for the accident.\nDamages incurred for these indemnifications would be covered by the Company’s general liability insurance to the extent provided by the\npolicy limitations. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements. As a result, the estimated valuation of the potential liability arising from these agreements is not material. Accordingly, the\nCompany recorded no liabilities for these agreements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nIn certain cases, the Company issues product warranty and performance guarantees to its customers for amounts generally equal to\n10% or less of the total sales agreement to endorse the execution of product delivery and to the warranty of design work, fabrication and\noperating performance of our devices. These guarantees are generally LCs that have a weighted average life at inception of 33 months.\nSee Note 6, “Lines of Credit – Letters of Credit,” for information related to LCs.\nLitigation\nFrom time-to-time, the Company has been named in and subject to various proceedings and claims in connection with its business.\nThe Company may in the future become involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including litigation that could be material to\nits business. The Company considers all claims, if any, on a quarterly basis and, based on known facts, assesses whether potential losses\nare considered reasonably possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, the Company then evaluates disclosure\nrequirements and whether to accrue for such claims in its consolidated financial statements. The Company records a provision for a liability\nwhen it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in\nwhich those temporary differences become deductible.\nThe Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated\nto use the existing deferred tax assets. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence,\nincluding recent results of operations, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future income, and available tax planning\nstrategies. A significant piece of objective positive evidence evaluated was the cumulative profit incurred in the U.S.\nOn the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2023, the Company recognized all of its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets\nwith the exception that the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on its California research and development (“R&D”) credit\ncarryovers of $4.6 million. The Company will maintain a valuation allowance on its California R&D credit carryovers because it is more likely\nthan not that the Company will continue to annually generate more California R&D tax credits than it utilizes, resulting in no net reduction of\ncredits. The Company’s policy with respect to California R&D credits is that they are utilized on a last-in, first-out basis.\nThe Company continues to assert that the accumulated foreign earnings of its subsidiaries in Spain and Canada are permanently\nreinvested. Due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) enacted in 2017, any future repatriation of the earnings of its subsidiaries in\nSpain and Canada would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. The Company has estimated that the foreign withholding taxes and U.S.\nstate income taxes related to a potential future repatriation of these earnings would be immaterial. The Company has evaluated the impact of\nthe global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) and has concluded that the impact to the Company is immaterial.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 69\nThe following table presents the Company’s California net operating loss carryforward.\nExpiration Year December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nCalifornia 2031 7,391 9,549\nUtilization of the California net operating loss carryforward may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership\nchange limitations provided by the California Revenue and Taxation Code which could result in the expiration of the net operating loss\ncarryforward before utilization.

The timing and amounts of any purchase under the Company’s\nshare repurchase program is based on market conditions and other factors including price, regulatory requirements, and capital availability.\nThe Company accounts for stock repurchases under these programs using the cost method.\nOn March 9, 2021, the Board authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase its outstanding\ncommon stock, at the discretion of management, up to $50.0 million in aggregate cost, which includes both the share value of the acquired\ncommon stock and the fees charged in connection with acquiring the common stock (the “March 2021 Authorization”). On July 1, 2022, the\nCompany concluded all share repurchases under the March 2021 Authorization.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has repurchased 8.1 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $80.5 million\nunder the March 2021 Authorization and all previous share repurchase programs.\nNote 12 — Stock-based Compensation\nStock Option Plans\nIn July 2020, the stockholders approved the 2020 Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”), that permits the grant of stock options, restricted\nstock units (“RSU”), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock awards (“RSA”), performance units, performance shares, and\nother stock-based awards to employees, officers, directors, and consultants. Prior to the approval of the 2020 Plan, the Company maintained\nthe 2016 Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (hereinafter referred to as the “Predecessor Plans”).\nSubject to adjustments, as provided in the 2020 Plan, the number of shares of common stock initially authorized for issuance under the 2020\nPlan was 5,894,727 shares (which consist of 4,500,000 new share awards plus 1,394,727 share awards that were authorized and unissued\nunder the Predecessor Plans) plus up to 4,850,630 shares that were set aside for awards granted under the Predecessor Plans that are\nsubsequently forfeited. The 2020 Plan supersedes all previously issued stock incentive plans (including the Predecessor Plans) and is\ncurrently the only available plan from which awards may be granted. The Company’s 2020 Plan and Predecessor Plans are hereinafter\nreferred to as “Equity Incentive Plans.”\nShares available for grant under the 2020 Plan at December 31, 2023 were 4,098,928 shares.

Non-employee board of director grants generally vest one year after the\ndate of grant or on the date of the annual stockholders’ meeting following the date of grant, whichever date occurs first. As RSUs vest, the\nunits will be settled in shares of common stock based on a one-to-one ratio. The units are valued based on the market price on the date of\ngrant.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nThere were no RSAs outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\nFair Value Assumptions\nStock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights\nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. To determine the inputs for\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model, the Company is required to develop several assumptions, which are highly subjective. The Company\ndetermines these inputs as follows:\n•Expected Term:\n◦Employees: Based on historical exercise data.\n◦Board of Directors: Based on the simplified method.\n◦Stock Appreciation Rights: Based upon the remaining grant life at each remeasurement date.\n•Expected Volatility: Based on the Company’s historical data and the corresponding expected term.\n•Risk-Free Interest Rate: Based on U.S. Treasury issues with terms similar to the expected term.\n•Dividend Yield: Based on an expected dividend yield of zero.\nThe following table presents assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated grant date fair\nvalues of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted to employees.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted average expected life (years) 9.1 4.1 4.0\nWeighted average expected volatility 60.4% 48.7% 49.3%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.87% – 3.87% 1.44% – 3.90% 0.30% – 1.51%\nWeighted average dividend yield —% —% —%\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe fair value of RSUs granted to employees is based on the Company’s common stock price on the date of grant.\nTable of Contents\nENERGY RECOVERY, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Recovery, Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K Annual Report | 75\nForfeitures\nThe Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates periodically in subsequent periods if actual\nforfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and records stock-based\ncompensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If the Company’s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its\nestimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the Company has recorded in the current period.\nThe following table presents the estimated weighted average forfeiture rates for all employees used in determining the expense in the\nstock-based compensation expense table above.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nStock options, stock appreciation rights and RSUs 6.4% 9.2% 8.1%\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents the stock-based compensation expense related to the fair value measurement of awards granted to\nemployees by expense category and by type of award.

Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that a control system, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met, and that no evaluation of\ncontrols can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Attestation Report of the\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company’s financial reporting.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.

PURPOSE\nThe purpose of the Energy Recovery, Inc. 2020 Incentive Plan is to promote the long-term success of the Company and the creation of stockholder value by (a) encouraging\nemployees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors of the Company and its Related Companies to focus on critical long-range\nobjectives, (b) encouraging the attraction and retention of such persons with exceptional qualifications, and (c) linking such persons directly to stockholder interests through\nincreased stock ownership.\nSECTION 2. DEFINITIONS\nCertain capitalized terms used in the Plan have the meanings set forth in Appendix A.\nSECTION 3. ADMINISTRATION\n3.1 Administration of the Plan\n(a) The Plan shall be administered by the Board or the Compensation Committee. The Board will cause the Compensation Committee to be composed of two or more\ndirectors and to satisfy the applicable requirements of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock may then be listed. For purposes of Awards to Participants who are\nsubject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, Compensation Committee means all of the members of the Compensation Committee who are “non-employee directors” within the\nmeaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act or any successor definition adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Awards to\nNonemployee Directors shall be made by the Board upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee.\n(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may delegate concurrent responsibility for administering the Plan, including with respect to designated classes of Eligible\nPersons, to different committees consisting of one or more members of the Board, subject to such limitations as the Board deems appropriate, except with respect to Awards\ngranted to Participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Members of any committee shall serve for such term as the Board may determine, subject to\nremoval by the Board at any time. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Board or the Compensation Committee may authorize one or more officers of the\nCompany to grant or amend Awards to designated classes of Eligible Persons, within limits specifically prescribed by the Board or the Compensation Committee; provided,\nhowever, that no such officer shall have or obtain authority to grant Awards to himself or herself or to any Participants who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, provided it meets the limitation in the preceding sentence, this delegation shall include the right to modify Awards as necessary to accommodate\nchanges in laws or regulations, including in jurisdictions outside the United States. Any delegation hereunder shall be subject to the restrictions and limits that the Board or\nthe Committee specifies at the time of such delegation, and the Board may at any time rescind the authority so delegated or appoint a new delegate. At all times, any\ndelegate appointed under this Section 3.1(b) shall serve in such capacity at the pleasure of the Board or the Committee.\n(c) All references in the Plan to the “Committee” shall be, as applicable, to the Board, the Compensation Committee or any other committee or any officer to whom authority\nhas been delegated to administer the Plan.\n– 1 –\n3.2 Administration and Interpretation by the Committee\n(a) Except for the terms and conditions explicitly set forth in the Plan and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee shall have full power and exclusive\nauthority, subject to such orders or resolutions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as may from time to time be adopted by the Board or a Committee composed of\nmembers of the Board, to (i) select the Eligible Persons to whom Awards may from time to time be granted under the Plan; (ii) determine the type or types of Awards to be\ngranted to each Participant under the Plan; (iii) determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Award granted under the Plan; (iv) determine the\nterms and conditions of any Award granted under the Plan; (v) approve the forms of notice or agreement for use under the Plan; (vi) amend, modify, suspend, discontinue or\nterminate the Plan, waive any restrictions or conditions applicable to any Award or amend or modify the terms and conditions of any outstanding Award; (vii) determine\nwhether, to what extent and under what circumstances Awards may be settled in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property or canceled or suspended; (viii) interpret\nand administer the Plan and any instrument evidencing an Award, notice or agreement executed or entered into under the Plan; (ix) establish such rules and regulations as it\nshall deem appropriate for the proper administration and operation of the Plan; (x) delegate ministerial duties to such of the Company’s employees as it so determines; and\n(xi) make any other determination and take any other action that the Committee deems necessary or desirable for administration of the Plan.\n(b) In no event, however, shall the Committee have the right, without stockholder approval, to (i) lower the exercise or grant price of an Option or SAR after it is granted,\nexcept in connection with adjustments provided in Section 15.1 of the Plan; (ii) take any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting\nprinciples; or (iii) cancel an Option or SAR at a time when its exercise or grant price exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying stock in exchange for cash, another\noption, stock appreciation right, restricted stock, restricted stock unit or other equity, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition,\nspin-off or other similar corporate transaction.\n(c) The effect on the vesting of an Award of a Company-approved leave of absence or a Participant’s reduction in hours of employment or service shall be determined by\nthe Company’s General Counsel or, with respect to directors or executive officers, by the Compensation Committee, whose determination shall be final.\n(d) Decisions of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, any Participant, any stockholder and any Eligible Person. A\nmajority of the members of the Committee may determine its actions.\nSECTION 4. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN\n4.1 Authorized Number of Shares\nSubject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Section 15.1 of the Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be:\n(a) 4,500,000 shares; plus\n(b) (i) up to 1,394,727 authorized shares available for issuance and not issued or subject to outstanding awards under the Company’s 2016 Incentive Plan as of the\nEffective Date, which shares shall cease to be set aside or reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2016 Incentive Plan effective on the Effective Date and shall instead be set\naside and reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan, and (ii) up to 4,954,723 shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan and the 2008 Equity\nIncentive Plan (the “Prior Plans”) as of the Effective Date that cease to be subject to such awards following the Effective Date (other than by reason of exercise or settlement\nof the awards to the extent they are exercised for or settled in vested or nonforfeitable shares), which shares shall cease to be set aside or reserved for issuance pursuant to\nthe Prior Plans effective on the date upon which they cease to be so subject to such awards and shall instead be set aside and reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan.\nNo awards may be granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan after the Effective Date.\nShares issued under the Plan shall be drawn from authorized and unissued shares or shares now held or subsequently acquired by the Company as treasury shares.\n– 2 –\n4.2 Share Usage\n(a) If any Award lapses, expires, terminates or is canceled prior to the issuance of shares thereunder or if shares of Common Stock are issued under the Plan to a\nParticipant and thereafter are forfeited to the Company, the shares subject to such Awards and the forfeited shares shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. The\nfollowing shares shall not again become available for issuance under the Plan: (i) shares of Common Stock tendered by a Participant or retained by the Company as full or\npartial payment to the Company upon exercise of an Option, (ii) shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance upon grant of SARs, to the extent the number of reserved\nshares exceeds the number of shares actually issued upon exercise of the SARs, and (iii) shares of Common Stock withheld by, or otherwise tendered to, the Company to\nsatisfy a Participant’s tax withholding obligations in connection with an Award. The number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall not be\nreduced to reflect any dividends or dividend equivalents that are reinvested into additional shares of Common Stock or credited as additional shares of Common Stock\nsubject to or paid with respect to an Award.\n(b) The Committee shall also, without limitation, have the authority to grant Awards as an alternative to or as the form of payment for grants or rights earned or due under\nother compensation plans or arrangements of the Company.\n(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Committee may grant Substitute Awards under the Plan. Substitute Awards shall not reduce the\nnumber of shares authorized for issuance under the Plan. In the event that an Acquired Entity has shares available for awards or grants under one or more preexisting plans\nnot adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, then, to the extent determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee, the shares available for grant\npursuant to the terms of such preexisting plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such\nacquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to holders of common stock of the entities that are parties to such acquisition or combination) may be used\nfor Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that Awards using such\navailable shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of such preexisting plans, absent the acquisition or combination,\nand shall be made only to individuals who were not employees or directors of the Company or a Related Company prior to such acquisition or combination. In the event that a\nwritten agreement between the Company and an Acquired Entity pursuant to which a merger or consolidation is completed is approved by the Board and that agreement sets\nforth the terms and conditions of the substitution for or assumption of outstanding awards of the Acquired Entity, those terms and conditions shall be deemed to be the action\nof the Committee without any further action by the Committee, except as may be required for compliance with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, and the persons holding\nsuch awards shall be deemed to be Participants.\n4.3 Maximum Awards\nThe maximum Common Stock amounts in this Section 4.3 are subject to adjustment under Section 15.1 of the Plan and are subject to the Plan maximum set forth in\nSection 4.1 of the Plan.\n(a) Limit on Awards to Participants\n(i) No Participant may be granted Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in any calendar year period with respect to more than an aggregate of 500,000 shares of\nCommon Stock for such Awards, except that the Company may make additional one-time grants of such Awards for up to an aggregate of 300,000 shares to newly hired or\nnewly promoted individuals.\n(ii) No Participant may be granted Awards other than Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Units or other Awards denominated in cash or other\nproperty in any calendar year period with respect to more than an aggregate of 500,000 shares of Common Stock for such Awards, except that the Company may make\nadditional one-time grants of such Awards for up to 300,000 shares to newly hired or newly promoted individuals.\n(iii) The maximum dollar value payable with respect to Performance Units or other Awards denominated in cash or other property subject to Section 16 of the Plan\ngranted to any Participant in any one calendar year is $7,500,000.\n(b) Limit on Awards to Nonemployee Directors.

The Board may make an exception to the limit in this\nSection 4.3(a) for any Nonemployee Director in extraordinary circumstances, as the Board may determine in its discretion, provided that any Nonemployee Director who is\ngranted or paid such additional compensation may not participate in the decision to grant or pay such additional compensation.\n(c) Incentive Stock Options. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options shall be 4,500,000 shares.\n– 3 –\nSECTION 5. ELIGIBILITY\n5.1 General\nAn Award may be granted to any employee, officer or director of the Company or a Related Company whom the Committee from time to time selects.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee is specifically authorized to adopt rules,\nprocedures and subplans with provisions that limit or modify rights on death, disability or termination of employment, available methods of exercise or settlement of an\nAward, payment of income, social insurance contributions and payroll taxes, the shifting of employer tax liability to the Participant, withholding procedures, the conversion of\nlocal currency and handling of any stock certificates or other indicia of ownership which may vary with local requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may\nnot take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate the Exchange Act, the Code, any securities law or governing statute or any other\napplicable law.\nSECTION 6. AWARDS\n6.1 Form, Grant and Settlement of Awards\nThe Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to determine the type or types of Awards to be granted under the Plan.

OPTIONS\n7.1 Grant of Options\nThe Committee may grant Options designated as Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options.\n7.2 Option Exercise Price\nOptions shall be granted with an exercise price per share not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Grant Date (and such exercise price shall\nnot be less than the minimum exercise price required by Code Section 422 with respect to Incentive Stock Options), except in the case of Substitute Awards.\n7.3 Term of Options\nSubject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the instrument evidencing the Option, the maximum term of an Option shall be ten years from the\nGrant Date.\n7.4 Exercise of Options\nThe Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option the time at which, or the installments in which, the Option shall vest and become\nexercisable.\nTo the extent an Option has vested and become exercisable, the Option may be exercised in whole or from time to time in part by delivery, as directed by the Company, to\nthe Company or a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company of a properly executed stock option exercise agreement or notice, in a form and in accordance\nwith procedures established by the Committee, setting forth the number of shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, the restrictions imposed on the shares\npurchased under such exercise agreement or notice, if any, and such representations and agreements as may be required by the Committee, accompanied by payment in\nfull as described in Section 7.5 of the Plan. An Option may be exercised only for whole shares and may not be exercised for less than a reasonable number of shares at any\none time, as determined by the Committee.\n7.5 Payment of Exercise Price\nThe exercise price for shares purchased under an Option shall be paid in full to the Company by delivery of consideration equal to the product of the Option exercise price\nand the number of shares purchased. Such consideration must be paid before the Company will issue the shares being purchased and must be in a form or a combination of\nforms acceptable to the Committee for that purchase, which forms may include:\n(a) cash;\n(b) check or wire transfer;\n(c) having the Company withhold shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued on exercise of the Option that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the\naggregate exercise price of the shares being purchased under the Option;\n(d) tendering (either actually or, so long as the Common Stock is registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, by attestation) shares of Common Stock\nowned by the Participant that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate exercise price of the shares being purchased under the Option;\n(e) so long as the Common Stock is registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and to the extent permitted by law, delivery of a properly executed\nexercise agreement or notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a brokerage firm designated or approved by the Company to deliver promptly to the Company the\naggregate amount of proceeds to pay the Option exercise price and any withholding tax obligations that may arise in connection with the exercise, all in accordance with the\nregulations of the Federal Reserve Board; or\n(f) such other consideration as the Committee may permit.\n– 5 –\n7.6 Effect of Termination of Service\n(a) The Committee shall establish and set forth in each instrument that evidences an Option whether the Option shall continue to be exercisable, and the terms and\nconditions of such exercise, after a Termination of Service, any of which provisions may be waived or modified by the Committee at any time.\n(b) If the exercise of the Option following a Participant’s Termination of Service, but while the Option is otherwise exercisable, would be prohibited solely because the\nissuance of Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act or similar requirements under the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction,\nthen the Option shall remain exercisable until the earlier of (i) the Option Expiration Date and (ii) the expiration of a period of three months (or such longer period of time as\ndetermined by the Committee in its sole discretion) after the Participant’s Termination of Service during which the exercise of the Option would not be in violation of such\nSecurities Act or other requirements.\nSECTION 8. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION LIMITATIONS\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the terms and conditions of any Incentive Stock Options shall in addition comply in all respects with Code\nSection 422, or any successor provision, and any applicable regulations thereunder. If the stockholders of the Company do not approve the Plan within 12 months after the\nBoard’s adoption of the Plan (or the Board’s adoption of any amendment to the Plan that constitutes the adoption of a new plan for purposes of Code Section 422), Incentive\nStock Options granted under the Plan after the date of the Board’s adoption (or approval) will be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. No Incentive Stock Options may be\ngranted more than ten years after the earlier of the approval by the Board or the stockholders of the Plan (or any amendment to the Plan that constitutes the adoption of a\nnew plan for purposes of Code Section 422). In interpreting and applying the provisions of the Plan, any Option granted as an Incentive Stock Option pursuant to the Plan\nshall, to the extent permitted by law, be construed as an “incentive stock option” within the meaning of Code Section 422.\nSECTION 9. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS\n9.1 Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights\nThe Committee may grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Participants at any time on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion. An SAR\nmay be granted in tandem with an Option or alone (“freestanding”). The grant price of a tandem SAR shall be equal to the exercise price of the related Option. The grant\nprice of a freestanding SAR shall be established in accordance with the procedures for Options set forth in Section 7.2 of the Plan. An SAR may be exercised upon such\nterms and conditions and for such term as the Committee determines in its sole discretion; provided, however, that, subject to earlier termination in accordance with the terms\nof the Plan and the instrument evidencing the SAR, the maximum term of a freestanding SAR shall be ten years, and in the case of a tandem SAR, (a) the term shall not\nexceed the term of the related Option and (b) the tandem SAR may be exercised for all or part of the shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to\nexercise the equivalent portion of the related Option, except that the tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the shares for which its related Option is then\nexercisable. An SAR agreement may provide for an automatic exercise of the SAR subject to any applicable requirements.\n9.2 Payment of SAR Amount\nUpon the exercise of an SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment in an amount determined by multiplying (a) the difference between the Fair Market Value of\nthe Common Stock on the date of exercise over the grant price of the SAR by (b) the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised. At the discretion of the\nCommittee as set forth in the instrument evidencing the Award, the payment upon exercise of an SAR may be in cash, in shares, in some combination thereof or in any other\nmanner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion.\nSECTION 10. STOCK AWARDS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND STOCK UNITS\n10.1 Grant of Stock Awards, Restricted Stock and Stock Units\nThe Committee may grant Stock Awards, Restricted Stock and Stock Units on such terms and conditions and subject to such repurchase or forfeiture restrictions, if any,\nwhich may be based on continuous employment or service with the Company or a Related Company or the achievement of any performance goals, as the Committee shall\ndetermine in its sole discretion, which terms, conditions and restrictions shall be set forth in the instrument evidencing the Award.\n– 6 –\n10.2 Vesting of Restricted Stock and Stock Units\nUpon the satisfaction of any terms, conditions and restrictions prescribed with respect to Restricted Stock or Stock Units, or upon a Participant’s release from any terms,\nconditions and restrictions on Restricted Stock or Stock Units, as determined by the Committee (a) the shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Award of Restricted Stock\nshall become freely transferable by the Participant, and (b) Stock Units shall be paid in shares of Common Stock or, if set forth in the instrument evidencing the Awards, in\ncash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. Any fractional shares subject to such Awards shall be paid to the Participant in cash.\nSECTION 11. PERFORMANCE AWARDS\n11.1 Performance Shares\nThe Committee may grant Awards of Performance Shares, designate the Participants to whom Performance Shares are to be awarded and determine the number of\nPerformance Shares and the terms and conditions of each such Award. Performance Shares shall consist of a unit valued by reference to a designated number of shares of\nCommon Stock, the value of which may be paid to the Participant by delivery of shares of Common Stock or, if set forth in the instrument evidencing the Award, of such\nproperty as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, cash, shares of Common Stock, other property, or any combination thereof, upon the attainment of\nPerformance Measures, as established by the Committee, and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee. The amount to be paid under an Award of\nPerformance Shares may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion.\n11.2 Performance Units\nThe Committee may grant Awards of Performance Units, designate the Participants to whom Performance Units are to be awarded and determine the number of\nPerformance Units and the terms and conditions of each such Award. Performance Units shall consist of a unit valued by reference to a designated amount of property other\nthan shares of Common Stock, which value may be paid to the Participant by delivery of such property as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, cash,\nshares of Common Stock, other property, or any combination thereof, upon the attainment of Performance Measures, as established by the Committee, and other terms and\nconditions specified by the Committee. The amount to be paid under an Award of Performance Units may be adjusted on the basis of such further consideration as the\nCommittee shall determine in its sole discretion.\nSECTION 12. OTHER STOCK- OR CASH-BASED AWARDS\nSubject to the terms of the Plan and such other terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate, the Committee may grant other incentives denominated in cash,\nshares of Common Stock or other property under the Plan, which incentives may be paid to the Participant by delivery of such property as the Committee shall determine,\nincluding, without limitation, cash, shares of Common Stock, other property, or any combination thereof, subject to the terms and conditions specified by the Committee.\nSECTION 13. WITHHOLDING\n(a) The Company or any Related Company may require the Participant to pay to the Company or any Related Company, as applicable, the amount of (i) any taxes that the\nCompany or any Related Company is required by applicable federal, state, local or foreign law to withhold with respect to the grant, vesting or exercise of an Award (“tax\nwithholding obligations”) and (ii) any amounts due from the Participant to the Company or to any Related Company (o“ther obligations”). Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of the Plan to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to issue any shares of Common Stock or otherwise settle an Award under the Plan until such tax\nwithholding obligations and other obligations are satisfied.\n(b) The Committee may permit or require a Participant to satisfy all or part of the Participant’s tax withholding obligations and other obligations by (i) paying cash to the\nCompany or a Related Company, as applicable, (ii) having the Company or a Related Company, as applicable, withhold an amount from any cash amounts otherwise due or\nto become due from the Company or a Related Company, as applicable, to the Participant, (iii) having the Company withhold a number of shares of Common Stock that\nwould otherwise be issued to the Participant (or become vested, in the case of Restricted Stock) having a Fair Market Value equal to the tax withholding obligations and other\nobligations, or (iv) surrendering a number of shares of Common Stock the Participant already owns having a value equal to the tax withholding obligations and other\nobligations. The value of the shares so withheld or tendered may not exceed the employer’s minimum required tax withholding rate or such other applicable rate as may be\napproved by the Committee so long as such withholding does not result in adverse treatment for financial accounting purposes.\n– 7 –\nSECTION 14. ASSIGNABILITY\nNo Award or interest in an Award may be sold, assigned, pledged (as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation or for any other purpose) or\ntransferred by a Participant or made subject to attachment or similar proceedings otherwise than by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution, except to the\nextent the Participant designates one or more beneficiaries on a Company-approved form who may exercise the Award or receive payment under the Award after the\nParticipant’s death. During a Participant’s lifetime, an Award may be exercised only by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing and to the extent permitted by Code\nSection 422, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may permit a Participant to assign or transfer an Award subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall\nspecify.\nSECTION 15. ADJUSTMENTS\n15.1 Adjustment of Shares\nIn the event that, at any time or from time to time, a stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation,\ndistribution to stockholders other than a normal cash dividend, or other change in the Company’s corporate or capital structure results in (i) the outstanding shares of\nCommon Stock, or any securities exchanged therefor or received in their place, being exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of the Company or (ii) new,\ndifferent or additional securities of the Company or any other company being received by the holders of shares of Common Stock, or in the event of an extraordinary cash\ndividend, then the Committee shall make proportional adjustments in (1) the maximum number and kind of securities available for issuance under the Plan; (2) the maximum\nnumber and kind of securities set forth in Section 4.3 of the Plan; and (3) the number and kind of securities that are subject to any outstanding Award and/or the per share\nprice of such securities. The determination by the Committee, as to the terms of any of the foregoing adjustments shall be conclusive and binding.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 15.1, the issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of\nany class, for cash or property, or for labor or services rendered, either upon direct sale or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of\nshares or obligations of the Company convertible into such shares or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to,\noutstanding Awards. Also notwithstanding the foregoing, a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, a reorganization or a Change in Control shall not be governed by this\nSection 15.1 but shall be governed by Sections 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4, respectively.\n15.2 Dissolution or Liquidation\nTo the extent not previously exercised or settled, and unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, Awards shall terminate immediately prior to the\ndissolution or liquidation of the Company. To the extent a vesting condition, forfeiture provision or repurchase right applicable to an Award has not been waived by the\nCommittee, the Award shall be forfeited immediately prior to the consummation of the dissolution or liquidation.\n15.3 Reorganization\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, unless the Committee shall determine otherwise in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written\nemployment, services or other agreement between the Participant and the Company or a Related Company, in the event that the Company is a party to a merger or\nconsolidation, all outstanding Awards shall be subject to the agreement of merger or consolidation approved by the Board, provided that such agreement shall provide for one\nor more of the following:\n(a) The continuation of such outstanding Awards by the Company (if the Company is the surviving corporation).\n(b) The assumption of such outstanding Awards by the surviving company or its parent, provided that the assumption of Options or SARs shall comply with Code\nSection 424(a) if the Options are Incentive Stock Options, and shall comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) if the Options are Nonqualified Stock\nOptions.\n(c) The substitution by the surviving company or its parent of new awards for such outstanding Awards, provided that the substitution of Options or SARs shall comply with\nCode Section 424(a) if the Options are Incentive Stock Options, and shall comply with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) if the Options are Nonqualified\nStock Options.\n– 8 –\n(d) The acceleration of the exercisability of 100% of the then unexercisable portion of such Options and SARs and acceleration of vesting of 100% of the then unvested\nportion of the Common Stock subject to such Options and SARs. The acceleration of exercisability of such Options and SARs and vesting of such Common Stock shall be\ncontingent on the closing of such merger or consolidation. The Optionee shall be able to exercise such Options and SARs during a period of not less than five full business\ndays preceding the closing date of such merger or consolidation, unless (i) a shorter period is required to permit a timely closing of such merger or consolidation and (ii) such\nshorter period still offers the Optionees a reasonable opportunity to exercise such Options and SARs. Any exercise of such Options and SARs during such period may be\ncontingent on the closing of such merger or consolidation.\n(e) The cancellation of outstanding Options and SARs and a payment to the Optionees equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of the Common Stock subject to such\nOptions and SARs (whether or not such Options and SARs are then exercisable or such Common Stock is then vested) as of the closing date of such merger or\nconsolidation over (ii) their exercise price. Such payment shall be made in the form of cash, cash equivalents, or securities of the surviving company or its parent with a fair\nmarket value equal to the required amount. Such payment may be subject to vesting based on the Optionee's continuing employment or service, provided that the vesting\nschedule shall not be less favorable to the Optionee than the schedule under which such Options and SARs would have become exercisable or such Common Stock would\nhave vested. If the exercise price of the Common Stock subject to such Options and SARs exceeds the fair market value of such Common Stock, then such Options and\nSARs may be cancelled without making a payment to the Optionees. For purposes of this Section 15.3(e), the fair market value of any security shall be determined without\nregard to any vesting conditions that may apply to such security.\n(f) The cancellation of outstanding Stock Units and a payment to the Participants equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock subject to such Stock Units (whether\nor not such Stock Units are then vested) as of the closing date of such merger or consolidation. Such payment shall be made in the form of cash, cash equivalents, or\nsecurities of the surviving company or its parent with a fair market value equal to the required amount. Such payment may be subject to vesting based on the Participant's\ncontinuing employment or service, provided that the vesting schedule shall not be less favorable to the Participant than the schedule under which such Stock Units would\nhave vested. For purposes of this Section 15.3(f), the fair market value of any security shall be determined without regard to any vesting conditions that may apply to such\nsecurity.\n15.4 Acceleration\nThe Committee shall have the discretion, exercisable either at the time the Award is granted or at any time while the Award remains outstanding, to provide for the automatic\nacceleration of vesting upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, whether or not the Award is to be assumed or replaced in the Change in Control, or in connection with a\ntermination of a Participant's service following a Change in Control.\n15.5 Further Adjustment of Awards\nSubject to Sections 15.2, 15.3 and 15.4 of the Plan, the Committee shall have the discretion, exercisable at any time before a sale, merger, consolidation, reorganization,\nliquidation, dissolution or change in control of the Company, as defined by the Committee, to take such further action as it determines to be necessary or advisable with\nrespect to Awards. Such authorized action may include (but shall not be limited to) establishing, amending or waiving the type, terms, conditions or duration of, or restrictions\non, Awards so as to provide for earlier, later, extended or additional time for exercise, lifting restrictions and other modifications, and the Committee may take such actions\nwith respect to all Participants, to certain categories of Participants or only to individual Participants. The Committee may take such action before or after granting Awards to\nwhich the action relates and before or after any public announcement with respect to such sale, merger, consolidation, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or change in\ncontrol that is the reason for such action.\n15.6 No Limitations\nThe grant of Awards shall in no way affect the Company’s right to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate,\ndissolve, liquidate or sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.\n15.7 No Fractional Shares\nIn the event of any adjustment in the number of shares covered by any Award, each such Award shall cover only the number of full shares resulting from such adjustment,\nand any fractional shares resulting from such adjustment shall be disregarded.\n– 9 –\n15.8 Section 409A\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, (a) any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 15 to Awards that are considered “deferred compensation”\nwithin the meaning of Section 409A shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A, and (b) any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 15 to Awards\nthat are not considered “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment the Awards either\n(i) continue not to be subject to Section 409A or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A.\nSECTION 16. AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION\n16.1 Amendment, Suspension or Termination\nThe Board or the Compensation Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any portion of the Plan at any time and in such respects as it shall deem\nadvisable; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, stockholder approval shall be required for any amendment to\nthe Plan; and provided, further, that any amendment that requires stockholder approval may be made only by the Board. Subject to Section 16.3 of the Plan, the Committee\nmay amend the terms of any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively.\n16.2 Term of the Plan\nUnless sooner terminated as provided herein, the Plan shall terminate ten years from the Effective Date. After the Plan is terminated, no future Awards may be granted, but\nAwards previously granted shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the Plan’s terms and conditions.\n16.3 Consent of Participant\nThe amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan or a portion thereof or the amendment of an outstanding Award shall not, without the Participant’s consent, materially\nadversely affect any rights under any Award theretofore granted to the Participant under the Plan. Any change or adjustment to an outstanding Incentive Stock Option shall\nnot, without the consent of the Participant, be made in a manner so as to constitute a “modification” that would cause such Incentive Stock Option to fail to continue to qualify\nas an Incentive Stock Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to Section 15.1 of the Plan shall not be subject to these restrictions.\nSECTION 17. GENERAL\n17.1 No Individual Rights\nNo individual or Participant shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and the Company has no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants under\nthe Plan.\nFurthermore, nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to constitute an employment contract or confer or be deemed to confer on any\nParticipant any right to continue in the employ of, or to continue any other relationship with, the Company or any Related Company or limit in any way the right of the\nCompany or any Related Company to terminate a Participant’s employment or other relationship at any time, with or without cause.\n17.2 Issuance of Shares\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock under the Plan or make any\nother distribution of benefits under the Plan unless, in the opinion of the Company’s counsel, such issuance, delivery or distribution would comply with all applicable laws\n(including, without limitation, the requirements of the Securities Act or the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction) and the applicable requirements of any securities exchange\nor similar entity.\n(b) The Company shall be under no obligation to any Participant to register for offering or resale or to qualify for exemption under the Securities Act, or to register or qualify\nunder the laws of any state or foreign jurisdiction, any shares of Common Stock, security or interest in a security paid or issued under, or created by, the Plan, or to continue\nin effect any such registrations or qualifications if made.\n– 10 –\n(c) As a condition to the exercise of an Option or any other receipt of Common Stock pursuant to an Award under the Plan, the Company may require (i) the Participant to\nrepresent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that such shares are being purchased or received only for the Participant’s own account and without any\npresent intention to sell or distribute such shares and (ii) such other action or agreement by the Participant as may from time to time be necessary to comply with the federal,\nstate and foreign securities laws. At the option of the Company, a stop-transfer order against any such shares may be placed on the official stock books and records of the\nCompany, and a legend indicating that such shares may not be pledged, sold or otherwise transferred, unless an opinion of counsel is provided (concurred in by counsel for\nthe Company) stating that such transfer is not in violation of any applicable law or regulation, may be stamped on stock certificates to ensure exemption from registration.\nThe Committee may also require the Participant to execute and deliver to the Company a purchase agreement or such other agreement as may be in use by the Company\nat such time that describes certain terms and conditions applicable to the shares.\n(d) To the extent the Plan or any instrument evidencing an Award provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of shares of Common Stock, the\nissuance may be effected on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange.\n17.3 Indemnification\nEach person who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a member of a committee appointed by the Board or an officer of the Company to whom authority was\ndelegated in accordance with Section 3.1 of the Plan, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability or expense that may\nbe imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such person in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such person may be a party or in\nwhich such person may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by such person in\nsettlement thereof, with the Company’s approval, or paid by such person in satisfaction of any judgment in any such claim, action, suit or proceeding against such person;\nprovided, however, that such person shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before such person undertakes to handle\nand defend it on such person’s own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability or expense is a result of such person’s own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by\nstatute.\nThe foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such person may be entitled under the Company’s certificate of\nincorporation or bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or of any power that the Company may have to indemnify or hold harmless.\n17.4 No Rights as a Stockholder\nUnless otherwise provided by the Committee or in the instrument evidencing the Award or in a written employment, services or other agreement, no Award, other than a\nStock Award or Restricted Stock, shall entitle the Participant to any cash dividend, voting or other right of a stockholder unless and until the date of issuance under the Plan\nof the shares that are the subject of such Award.\n17.5 Section 409A\n(a) General. The Plan and Awards granted under the Plan are intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A to the maximum extent possible, whether\npursuant to the short-term deferral exception described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), the exclusion applicable to stock options and certain other equity-\nbased compensation under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5), or otherwise. To the extent Section 409A is applicable to the Plan or any Award granted under the\nPlan, it is intended that the Plan and any Awards granted under the Plan comply with the deferral, payout and other limitations and restrictions imposed under Section 409A.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to the contrary, the Plan and any Award granted under the Plan shall be interpreted,\noperated and administered in a manner consistent with such intentions.\n(b) Separation from Service; Six-Month Delay. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award granted\nunder the Plan to the contrary, with respect to any payments and benefits under the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to which Section 409A applies, all references\nin the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan to the termination of the Participant’s employment or service are intended to mean the Participant’s “separation from\nservice,” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). In addition, if the Participant is a “specified employee,” within the meaning of Section 409A, then to the extent\nnecessary to avoid subjecting the Participant to the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable under the Plan or any\nAward granted under the Plan during the six-month period immediately following the Participant’s “separation from service,” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i),\nshall not be paid to the Participant during such period, but shall instead be accumulated and paid to the Participant (or, in the event of the Participant’s death, the\nParticipant’s estate) in a lump sum on the first business day after the earlier of the date that is six months following the Participant’s separation from service or the\nParticipant’s death.\n– 11 –\n(c) Unilateral Amendment.

In the event of a conflict between the terms and\nconditions of the Plan and this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail.\n2. Exercise of Option.\n(a) Right to Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Grant Notice and with the\napplicable provisions of the Plan and this Agreement.\n(b) Method of Exercise. The vested portion of the Option shall be exercisable by delivery of a notice of exercise in such form as may be designated by the\nCommittee from time to time, which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Option is being\nexercised, and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company. The notice of exercise shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate\nExercise Price (as set forth in the Grant Notice) as to all of the shares of Common Stock subject to the exercised Option, and any Tax Obligations (as defined in Section 6\nbelow).

Instead of surrendering shares of Common Stock, the Optionee may attest to the ownership of those shares on a form\nprovided by the Company and have the same number of shares of Common Stock subtracted from the Common Stock issued to the Optionee. This method of exercise is\navailable only to employees in the US.\n(iii) Irrevocable directions to a securities broker approved by the Company to sell all or a portion of the shares of Common Stock subject to the\nexercised Option and to deliver to the Company from the sale proceeds an amount sufficient to pay the Exercise Price and any Tax Obligations. (The balance of the sale\nproceeds, if any, will be delivered to the Optionee.)\nNo Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless such issuance and such exercise comply with applicable laws. Assuming\nsuch compliance, for income tax purposes the shares of Common Stock shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date on which the Option is exercised with\nrespect to such shares.\n(c) Restrictions on Exercise. This Option may not be exercised until such time as the Plan has been approved by the stockholders of the Company, or if the\nissuance of such Common Stock upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such Common Stock would constitute a violation of any applicable law.\n(d) Responsibility for Exercise. The Optionee is responsible for taking any and all actions as may be required to exercise this Option in a timely manner and for\nproperly executing any such documents as may be required for exercise in accordance with such rules and procedures as may be established from time to time. The\nCompany and/or any Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company shall have no duty or obligation to notify the Optionee of the Expiration Date of this Option.\n3.

In no event shall this Option be exercised later than the Expiration Date set forth in the\nGrant Notice.\n(b) Death; Disability. Upon the date of the Optionee’s Termination of Service with the Company or a Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company by reason of his\nor her Disability or death, the vesting of the Option shall be accelerated effective upon the date of the Optionee’s Termination of Service and the Option may be exercised for\ntwelve (12) months thereafter, provided that in no event shall this Option be exercised later than the Expiration Date set forth in the Grant Notice.\nBoard Stock Option Agreement | 2\n(c) Cause.

For purposes of this Option, the Optionee’s active service does not terminate when the Optionee goes on a\nmilitary leave, a sick leave or another bona fide leave of absence, if the leave was approved by the Company in writing. However, the Optionee’s active service terminates\nwhen the approved leave ends, unless the Optionee immediately returns to active work. If the Optionee goes on a leave of absence, then the vesting schedule specified in\nthe Grant Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the Company’s leave of absence policy or the terms of the Optionee’s leave if permissible under applicable local law. If\nthe Optionee commences working on a part-time basis, then the vesting schedule specified in the Grant Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the Company’s part-time\nwork policy or the terms of an agreement between the Optionee and the Company pertaining to the Optionee’s part-time schedule if permissible under applicable local law.\n(e) Forfeiture. The Optionee shall forfeit on the date designated by the Company (“Designated Date”) any right to exercise the Option if the Optionee fails to\ndeliver to the Company on or prior to the Designated Date a valid and signed original of the Grant Notice in a form acceptable to, and accepted by, the Company.\n4. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be\nexercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee. The terms of the Plan and this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, successors and\nassigns of the Optionee.

Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the Grant Notice, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the\nPlan and the terms of this Agreement.\n6. Tax Obligations.\n(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Optionee’s employer (the “Employer”) take with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance,\npayroll tax, payment on account or other tax‑related items arising out of the Optionee’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Optionee (“Tax Obligation”), the\nOptionee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Obligations is and remains the Optionee’s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the\nCompany and/or the Employer. The Optionee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the\ntreatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of\nshares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the\ngrant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Optionee’s liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if the Optionee has\nbecome subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Optionee acknowledges that the Company and/or\nthe Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction.\n(b) Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Optionee shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the\nEmployer to satisfy all Tax Obligations. In this regard, the Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the\nTax Obligations by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from the Optionee’s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Optionee by the Company, the\nEmployer and/or any Related Company; or (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired at exercise of the Option either through a voluntary\nsale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Optionee’s behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (iii) withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued\nat exercise of the Option.\n(c) The Company may withhold or account for Tax Obligations by considering applicable minimum or maximum statutory withholding amounts or other\napplicable withholding rates so long as such withholding does not result in adverse treatment for financial accounting purposes. If the obligation for Tax Obligations is\nsatisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, the Optionee is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the\nexercised Options, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Obligations due as a result of any aspect of the\nOptionee’s participation in the Plan.\n(d) The Optionee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax Obligations that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or\naccount for as a result of the Optionee’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described in this Section. The Company may refuse to\nissue or deliver the shares of Common Stock or the proceeds of the sale of shares, if the Optionee fails to comply with the Optionee’s obligations in connection with the Tax\nObligations.\n7. Restrictions on Resale. The Optionee agrees not to sell any Common Stock at a time when applicable laws, Company policies or an agreement between the\nCompany and its underwriters prohibit a sale. This restriction will apply as long as the Optionee’s service continues and for such period of time after the date of the\nOptionee’s Termination of Service as the Company may specify.\nBoard Stock Option Agreement | 3\n8. Retention Rights. The Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of the Option pursuant to the Vesting Schedule hereof is earned only by continuing\nservice at the will of the Company or the Employer and not through the act of being hired, being granted this Option or acquiring shares of Common Stock hereunder. The\nOptionee further acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Schedule set forth herein do not constitute an\nexpress or implied promise of continued engagement by the Company or the Employer in any capacity for the vesting period or for any period, or at all, and shall not interfere\nin any way with the Optionee’s right or the right of the Company or the Employer to terminate the Optionee’s service at any time, with or without cause subject to applicable\nlaw.\n9. Stockholder Rights. Neither the Optionee nor any person claiming under or through the Optionee shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the\nCompany in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder upon exercise of the Option unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in uncertificated\nform) will have been issued and recorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Optionee (including through\nelectronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Optionee shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including\nwith respect to the right to vote the Shares and the right to receive any cash or share dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions, nothing in this Section 9 eliminates or reduces the Company’s rights to enforce the terms and provisions of the [NTD Update: Claw-\nBack Policy], if applicable, to the extent permissible under applicable law.\n10.

Grant of Option. Pursuant to the Stock Option Grant Notice (the “Grant Notice”) to which this Stock Option Agreement and any Addendum (collectively this\n“Agreement”) are attached, Energy Recovery, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), has granted to the Optionee an Option under the Company’s 2020 Incentive\nPlan (the “Plan”) to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock indicated in the Grant Notice at the exercise price per share set forth in the Grant Notice (theE “xercise\nPrice”), and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Plan, and the Compensation Recovery Policy (if applicable), which is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail.\nIf designated in the Grant Notice as an Incentive Stock Option (or ISO) (i.e., U.S. Incentive Stock Option), this Option is intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option\nas defined in Section 422 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Nevertheless, to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of Code Section\n422(d), this Option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option (or NSO) (i.e., U.S. Nonstatutory Stock Option or Option that is not described in Section 422 or 423 of the\nCode). Further, if for any reason this Option (or portion thereof) shall not qualify as an ISO, then, to the extent of such nonqualification, such Option (or portion thereof) shall\nbe regarded as a NSO granted under the Plan. In no event shall the Committee, the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company or any of their respective\nemployees or directors have any liability to the Optionee (or any other person) due to the failure of the Option to qualify for any reason as an ISO.\n2. Exercise of Option.\n(a) Right to Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth on Appendix, attached hereto,\nprovided the Grantee is employed or in a service relationship on such Vesting Date, and remains in continuous service during the entire period commencing on the Vesting\nCommencement Date and ending on the applicable Vesting Date and with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Agreement.\n(b) Method of Exercise. The vested portion of the Option shall be exercisable by delivery of a notice of exercise in such form as may be designated by the\nCommittee from time to time, which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Option is being\nexercised, and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company. The notice of exercise shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate\nExercise Price (as set forth in the Grant Notice) as to all of the shares of Common Stock subject to the exercised Option, and any Tax Obligations (as defined in Section 6\nbelow). Payment may be made in one (or a combination of two or more) of the following forms:\n(i) Cash, a personal check, a cashier’s check or a wire transfer.\n(ii) For employees in the U.S., certificates for shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee, along with any forms\nneeded to effect a transfer of those shares to the Company. The Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock, determined as of the effective date of the Option\nexercise, will be applied to the Exercise Price. Instead of surrendering shares of Common Stock, the Optionee may attest to the ownership of those shares on a form\nprovided by the Company and have the same number of shares of Common Stock subtracted from the Common Stock issued to the Optionee. This method of exercise is\navailable only to employees in the U.S.\n(iii) Irrevocable directions to a securities broker approved by the Company to sell all or a portion of the shares of Common Stock subject to the\nexercised Option and to deliver to the Company from the sale proceeds an amount sufficient to pay the Exercise Price and any Tax Obligations. (The balance of the sale\nproceeds, if any, will be delivered to the Optionee.)\nNo Common Stock shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless such issuance and such exercise comply with applicable laws. Assuming such\ncompliance, for income tax purposes the shares of Common Stock shall be considered transferred to the Optionee on the date on which the Option is exercised with respect\nto such shares.\n(c) Restrictions on Exercise. This Option may not be exercised until such time as the Plan has been approved by the stockholders of the Company, or if the issuance\nof such Common Stock upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for such Common Stock would constitute a violation of any applicable law.\n(d) Responsibility for Exercise. The Optionee is responsible for taking any and all actions as may be required to exercise this Option in a timely manner and for\nproperly executing any such documents as may be required for exercise in accordance with such rules and procedures as may be established from time to time. The\nCompany and/or any Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company shall have no duty or obligation to notify the Optionee of the Expiration Date of this Option.\nExecutive Stock Option Agreement | 1\n3. Termination of Service; Forfeiture.\n(a) General Rule. Except as provided below in Sections 3(b), 3(c), and 3(d), and subject to the Plan, to the extent vested on the date of the Optionee’s\nTermination of Service, this Option may be exercised for three (3) months after the date of the Optionee’s Termination of Service with the Company or a Parent, Subsidiary\nor Related Company. The date of Termination of Service will be the date on which the Optionee ceases active employment or service (as determined by the Committee or as\nprovided in the Plan) and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law. In no event shall this Option be exercised later than the Expiration Date set\nforth in the Grant Notice.\n(b) Death; Disability. Upon the date of the Optionee’s Termination of Service with the Company or a Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company by reason of his\nor her Disability or death, the vesting of the Option shall be accelerated effective upon the date of the Optionee’s Termination of Service and the Option may be exercised for\ntwelve (12) months thereafter, provided that in no event shall this Option be exercised later than the Expiration Date set forth in the Grant Notice.\n(c) Severance and Change in Control Plans. If the Optionee is eligible for severance benefits as provided for in Sections 2 and 3.1 of the Energy Recovery,\nInc. Severance Plan, the Accelerated Shares (as defined in the Grant Notice) may be exercised for six (6) months after the date of the Optionee’s Termination of Service with\nthe Company or a Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company, provided that in no event shall this Option be exercised later than the Expiration Date set forth in the Grant\nNotice. Exercising an Option during the period permitted in this Section 3(c) but after the period provided for in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) may cause an Option that would\notherwise qualify as an ISO to lose its status as an ISO. In the event of a Change in Control as defined in the Energy Recovery, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan (the\n“CIC Plan”), the vesting of the Award will be treated in accordance with the terms of the CIC Plan.\n(d) Cause. Upon the Optionee’s Termination of Service by the Company or a Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company for cause (as determined by the\nCommittee or as provided in the Plan), the Option shall expire on the date of the Optionee’s Termination of Service.\n(e) Leave of Absence and Part-Time Work. For purposes of this Option, the Optionee’s active service does not terminate when the Optionee goes on a\nmilitary leave, a sick leave or another bona fide leave of absence, if the leave was approved by the Company in writing. However, the Optionee’s active service terminates\nwhen the approved leave ends, unless the Optionee immediately returns to active work. If the Optionee goes on a leave of absence, then the vesting schedule specified in\nthe Grant Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the Company’s leave of absence policy or the terms of the Optionee’s leave if permissible under applicable local law. If\nthe Optionee commences working on a part-time basis, then the vesting schedule specified in the Grant Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the Company’s part-time\nwork policy or the terms of an agreement between the Optionee and the Company pertaining to the Optionee’s part-time schedule if permissible under applicable local law.\n(f) Forfeiture. The Optionee shall forfeit on the date designated by the Company (“Designated Date”) any right to exercise the Option if the Optionee fails to\ndeliver to the Company on or prior to the Designated Date a valid and signed original of the Grant Notice in a form acceptable to, and accepted by, the Company.\n4. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be\nexercised during the lifetime of the Optionee only by the Optionee. The terms of the Plan and this Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, successors and\nassigns of the Optionee. Regardless of any marital property settlement agreement, the Company is not obligated to honor a notice of exercise from the Optionee’s former\nspouse, nor is the Company obligated to recognize the Optionee’s former spouse’s interest in the Option in any other way.\n5. Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the Grant Notice, and may be exercised during such term only in accordance with the\nPlan and the terms of this Agreement.\n6. Tax Obligations.\n(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Optionee’s employer (the “Employer”) take with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance,\npayroll tax, payment on account or other tax‑related items arising out of the Optionee’s participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Optionee (“Tax Obligation”), the\nOptionee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Obligations is and remains the Optionee’s responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the\nCompany and/or the Employer. The Optionee further acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the\ntreatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of\nshares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the\ngrant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate the Optionee’s liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any particular tax result. Furthermore, if the Optionee has\nbecome subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Optionee acknowledges that the Company and/or\nthe Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction.\nExecutive Stock Option Agreement | 2\n(b) Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Optionee shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the\nEmployer to satisfy all Tax Obligations. In this regard, the Optionee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the\nTax Obligations by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from the Optionee’s wages or other cash compensation paid to the Optionee by the Company, the\nEmployer and/or any Related Company; or (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired at exercise of the Option either through a voluntary\nsale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Optionee’s behalf pursuant to this authorization); or (iii) withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued\nat exercise of the Option.\n(c) The Company may withhold or account for Tax Obligations by considering applicable minimum or maximum statutory withholding amounts or other\napplicable withholding rates so long as such withholding does not result in adverse treatment for financial accounting purposes. If the obligation for Tax Obligations is\nsatisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, the Optionee is deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the\nexercised Options, notwithstanding that a number of the shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Obligations due as a result of any aspect of the\nOptionee’s participation in the Plan.\n(d) The Optionee shall pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax Obligations that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or\naccount for as a result of the Optionee’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described in this Section. The Company may refuse to\nissue or deliver the shares of Common Stock or the proceeds of the sale of shares, if the Optionee fails to comply with the Optionee’s obligations in connection with the Tax\nObligations.\n(e) If the Option granted to the Optionee herein is an ISO and the Optionee is subject to tax in the United States, and if the Optionee sells or otherwise\ndisposes of any of the Common Stock acquired pursuant to the ISO on or before the later of (i) the date two (2) years after the Date of Grant, or (ii) the date one (1) year after\nthe date of exercise, the Optionee shall immediately notify the Company in writing of such disposition. The Optionee agrees that the Optionee may be subject to a Tax\nObligation by the Company or the Employer on the compensation income recognized by the Optionee.\n7. Restrictions on Resale. The Optionee agrees not to sell any Common Stock at a time when applicable laws, Company policies or an agreement between the\nCompany and its underwriters prohibit a sale. This restriction will apply as long as the Optionee’s service continues and for such period of time after the date of the\nOptionee’s Termination of Service as the Company may specify.\n8. Retention Rights. The Optionee acknowledges and agrees that the vesting of the Option pursuant to the Vesting Schedule hereof is earned only by continuing\nservice at the will of the Company or the Employer and not through the act of being hired, being granted this Option or acquiring shares of Common Stock hereunder. The\nOptionee further acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereunder and the Vesting Schedule set forth herein do not constitute an\nexpress or implied promise of continued engagement by the Company or the Employer in any capacity for the vesting period or for any period, or at all, and shall not interfere\nin any way with the Optionee’s right or the right of the Company or the Employer to terminate the Optionee’s service at any time, with or without cause subject to applicable\nlaw.\n9. Stockholder Rights. Neither the Optionee nor any person claiming under or through the Optionee shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the\nCompany in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder upon exercise of the Option unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in uncertificated\nform) will have been issued and recorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Optionee (including through\nelectronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Optionee shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including\nwith respect to the right to vote the Shares and the right to receive any cash or share dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions, nothing in this Section 9 eliminates or reduces the Company’s rights to enforce the terms and provisions of the Compensation\nRecovery Policy, if applicable, to the extent permissible under applicable law.\n10. Nature of Grant. In accepting the Option, the Optionee acknowledges that:\n(a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, is discretionary in nature, and may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any\ntime;\n(b) the grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of options, or benefits in lieu\nof options, even if options have been granted repeatedly in the past;\n(c) if applicable, in the event the Company later determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company is required to recover certain compensation paid to\nGrantee pursuant to the Compensation Recovery Policy, the Company reserves the right to pursue and any and all actions identified in the Compensation Recovery Policy,\nto the extent permissible under applicable law.\n(d) all decisions with respect to future option grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;\n(e) the Optionee’s participation in the Plan is voluntary;\nExecutive Stock Option Agreement | 3\n(f) the Optionee’s participation in the Plan shall not create a right to further employment with the Company or the Employer and shall not interfere with the\nability of the Company or the Employer to terminate the Optionee’s employment or service relationship (if any) at any time;\n(g) the future value of the shares of Common Stock underlying the Option is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty;\n(h) if the underlying shares of Common Stock do not increase in value, the Option will have no value;\n(i) the Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company making any recommendations regarding the Optionee’s participation in\nthe Plan or the Optionee’s purchase or sale of shares of Common Stock;\n(j) the Optionee is hereby advised to consult with his or her own personal tax, legal and financial advisors regarding participation in the Plan before taking any\naction related to the Plan;\n(k) the Option and the benefits under the Plan, if any, will not automatically transfer to another company in the case of a merger, take-over or transfer of\nliability;\n(l) the Option and any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan are extraordinary items that do not constitute compensation of any kind for services\nof any kind rendered to the Company, the Employer, or any Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company, and that are outside the scope of the Optionee’s employment or service\ncontract, if any;\n(m) the Option and any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation;\n(n) the Option and any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purposes,\nincluding, but not limited to, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement\nor welfare benefits or similar payments and in no event should be considered as compensation for, or relating in any way to, past services for the Company, the Employer, or\nany Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company; and\n(o) in consideration of the grant of the Option, no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from termination of the Option or diminution in\nvalue of the Option or shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option resulting from the Optionee’s Termination of Service (for any reason whatsoever and\nwhether or not in breach of local labor laws) and the Optionee irrevocably releases the Company, the Employer, and/or any Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company from any\nsuch claim that may arise; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen, then by exercising the Option,\nOptionee shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived his or her entitlement to pursue such claim.\n11. Data Privacy Notice and Consent. The Optionee hereby explicitly and unambiguously consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other\nform, of the Optionee’s personal data as described in this Agreement, including the Addendum, and any other Option materials by and among, as applicable, the\nCompany, the Employer, and any Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Optionee’s\nparticipation in the Plan.\nThe Optionee hereby acknowledges that he or she understands that the Company and the Employer may hold certain personal information about the\nOptionee, including, but not limited to, the Optionee’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance or other identification number,\nsalary, nationality, job title, any shares of Common Stock or directorships held in the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Related Company, details of all\noptions or any other entitlement to shares of Common Stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Optionee’s favor (“Data”), for\nthe exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan.\nThe Optionee hereby acknowledges that he or she understands that Data will be transferred to any Company authorized third party(ies) assisting in the\nimplementation, administration and management of the Plan.

Tax Obligations. Regardless of any action the Company and/or the Grantee’s actual employer (the “Employer”), if the Company is not the Grantee’s employer,\ntakes with respect to any or all income tax, social security, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantee’s participation in the Plan and\nlegally applicable to the Grantee (“Tax Obligations”), the Grantee hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Obligations is and remains the Grantee’s\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company and/or the Employer. The Grantee further acknowledges that neither the Company nor the\nEmployer (1) makes any representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units,\nincluding, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the\nsubsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (2) does not commit to and is under no\nobligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Grantee’s liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any\nparticular tax result. Further, if the Grantee has become subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, the\nGrantee hereby acknowledges that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction.\nPrior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy\nall Tax Obligations. In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any applicable\nwithholding obligations or rights with regard to the Tax Obligations by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from the Grantee’s wages or other cash\ncompensation paid to the Grantee by the Company, the Employer and/or any Related Company; or (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock\nissued upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Grantee’s behalf\npursuant to this authorization); or (iii) withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units.\nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax Obligations by considering applicable minimum or maximum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding\nrates so long as such withholding does not result in adverse treatment for financial accounting purposes. If the obligation for Tax Obligations is satisfied by withholding in\nShares, for tax purposes, the Grantee shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a\nnumber of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Obligations due as a result of any aspect of the Grantee’s participation in the Plan.\nFinally, the Grantee shall pay to the Company and/or the Employer any amount of Tax Obligations that the Company and/or the Employer may be required to withhold or\naccount for as a result of the Grantee’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Grantee hereby acknowledges and agrees\nthat the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares, any cash payments receivable at settlement or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if the Grantee fails to comply\nwith his or her obligations in connection with the Tax Obligations.\n5. Restricted Stock Units and Interests Not Transferable. No Restricted Stock Units or any interest or right therein or part thereof shall be liable for the debts,\ncontracts or engagements of the Grantee or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance,\nassignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or\nequitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect.\n6. Rights as Stockholder. Neither the Grantee nor any person claiming under or through the Grantee shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the\nCompany in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in uncertificated form) will have been issued and\nrecorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Grantee (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage\naccount). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Grantee shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including with respect to the right to vote the\nShares and the right to receive any cash or share dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions,\nnothing in this Section 6 eliminates or reduces the Company’s rights to enforce the terms and provisions of the Compensation Recovery Policy, if applicable, to the extent\npermissible under applicable law.\nExecutive Restricted Stock Unit Agreement | 2\n7. Restrictions on Resale. The Grantee hereby agrees not to sell any Shares at a time when applicable laws, Company policies or an agreement between the\nCompany and/or its underwriters prohibit a sale. This restriction (if any) will apply as long as the Grantee’s service continues and for such period of time after the Grantee’s\nTermination of Service as the Company may specify.\n8. Adjustments.

The Grantee’s active service does not terminate when the Grantee goes on a military leave, a sick\nleave or another bona fide leave of absence, if the leave was approved by the Company in writing. However, the Grantee’s active service terminates when the approved\nleave ends, unless the Grantee immediately returns to active service. If the Grantee goes on a leave of absence, then the vesting schedule specified in the Grant Notice may\nbe adjusted in accordance with the Company’s leave of absence policy or the terms of the Grantee’s leave if permissible under applicable local law.

The Grantee further acknowledges that neither the Company nor the\nEmployer (1) makes any representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units,\nincluding, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of Shares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the\nsubsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and/or any dividend equivalents; and (2) does not commit to and is under no\nobligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Grantee’s liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any\nparticular tax result.

In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy any applicable\nwithholding obligations or rights with regard to the Tax Obligations by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from the Grantee’s wages or other cash\ncompensation paid to the Grantee by the Company, the Employer and/or any Related Company; or (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock\nissued upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Grantee’s behalf\npursuant to this authorization); or (iii) withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units.\nThe Company may withhold or account for Tax Obligations by considering applicable minimum or maximum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding\nrates so long as such withholding does not result in adverse treatment for financial accounting purposes. If the obligation for Tax Obligations is satisfied by withholding in\nShares, for tax purposes, the Grantee shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a\nnumber of Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Obligations due as a result of any aspect of the Grantee’s participation in the Plan.\nFinally, the Grantee shall pay to the Company and/or the Employer any amount of Tax Obligations that the Company and/or the Employer may be required to withhold or\naccount for as a result of the Grantee’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Grantee hereby acknowledges and agrees\nthat the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares, any cash payments receivable at settlement or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if the Grantee fails to comply\nwith his or her obligations in connection with the Tax Obligations.\n5.

No Restricted Stock Units or any interest or right therein or part thereof shall be liable for the debts,\ncontracts or engagements of the Grantee or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance,\nassignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or\nequitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect.\n6. Rights as Stockholder. Neither the Grantee nor any person claiming under or through the Grantee shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the\nCompany in respect of any Shares issuable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in uncertificated form) will have been issued and\nrecorded on the books and records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Grantee (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage\naccount). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Grantee shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including with respect to the right to vote the\nShares and the right to receive any cash or share dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.\n7. Restrictions on Resale. The Grantee hereby agrees not to sell any Shares at a time when applicable laws, Company policies or an agreement between the\nCompany and/or its underwriters prohibit a sale. This restriction (if any) will apply as long as the Grantee’s service continues and for such period of time after the Grantee’s\nTermination of Service as the Company may specify.\n8. Adjustments.

Any Restricted Stock Units which are not vested as of the date of the Grantee’s Termination of Service shall thereupon be forfeited\nimmediately and without any further action by the Company. In the event of the Grantee’s Termination of Service (whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of\nemployment or other applicable law in the jurisdiction where the Grantee is providing services or the terms of the Grantee's employment or service agreement, if any), the\nGrantee’s right, if any, to vest in the Restricted Stock Units under the Plan shall terminate effective as of the date that the Grantee is no longer actively providing services and\nshall not be extended by any notice period mandated under local law; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when the Grantee is no longer actively\nproviding services for purposes of the Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder.\n(b) Vesting.

The Grantee’s active service does not terminate when the Grantee goes on a military leave, a sick\nleave or another bona fide leave of absence, if the leave was approved by the Company in writing or to the extent required by applicable local law. However, the Grantee’s\nactive service terminates when the approved leave ends, unless the Grantee immediately returns to active work. If the Grantee goes on a leave of absence, then the vesting\nschedule specified in the Grant Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the Company’s leave of absence policy or the terms of the Grantee’s leave if permissible under\napplicable local law. If the Grantee commences working on a part-time basis, then the vesting schedule specified in the Grant Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the\nCompany’s part-time work policy or the terms of an agreement between the Grantee and the Company pertaining to the Grantee’s part-time schedule if permissible under\napplicable local law.\n3. Settlement.\n(a) Time and Form of Payment. Subject to the terms of the Plan and this Agreement, any Restricted Stock Units that vest and become nonforfeitable shall be\nsettled in whole Shares, which shall be issued in book-entry form, registered in the Grantee’s name. Such settlement shall be made as soon as practicable, but no later than\n60 days, following the date of vesting. The value of any fractional Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in cash at the time the Shares are delivered in settlement of the\nRestricted Stock Units.\n(b) Conditions to Settlement of Restricted Stock Units. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including without limitation Section 2(b)):\n(i) No Shares shall be issued to the Grantee or his or her legal representative unless and until the Grantee or his or her legal representative shall\nhave satisfied all applicable tax withholding obligations pursuant to Section 4 hereof.\nEmployee (non-US) Restricted Stock Unit Agreement | 1\n(ii) The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any Shares prior to the fulfillment of all of the following conditions: (A) the admission of the\nShares subject to the award to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Common Stock is then listed; (B) the completion of any subject to the Award registration or other\nqualification of the Shares under any applicable securities law, any U.S. state or federal or foreign law, or under rulings or regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission or other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, deem necessary and advisable, or if the offering of the\nShares is not so registered, a determination by the Company that the issuance of the Shares would be exempt from any such registration or qualification requirements; (C)\nthe obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state or federal or foreign governmental agency that the Committee shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be\nnecessary or advisable; and (D) the lapse of any such reasonable period of time following the date the Restricted Stock Units vest as the Committee may from time to time\nestablish for reasons of administrative convenience.\n4. Tax Obligations.\n(a) Regardless of any action the Company and/or any Related Company to whom the Grantee provides services (the S“ervice Recipient”) takes with respect\nto any or all income tax, social security contributions, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Grantee’s\nparticipation in the Plan and legally applicable to the Grantee (“Tax Obligations”), the Grantee hereby acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all Tax Obligations is and\nremains the Grantee’s responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company and/or the Service Recipient. The Grantee further acknowledges\nthat neither the Company nor the Service Recipient (1) makes any representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any\naspect of the Restricted Stock Units or the underlying Shares, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the issuance of\nShares upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends and/or any\ndividend equivalents; and (2) does not commit to and is under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or\neliminate the Grantee’s liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Grantee has become subject to Tax Obligations in more than one\njurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable event, the Grantee hereby acknowledges that the Company or the Service Recipient may be\nrequired to withhold or account for Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction.\n(b) Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Grantee shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the\nService Recipient to satisfy all Tax Obligations. In this regard, the Grantee authorizes the Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their\ndiscretion, to satisfy any applicable withholding obligations or rights with regard to all Tax Obligations by one or a combination of the following: (i) requiring the Grantee to\nmake a payment in a form acceptable to the Company; (ii) withholding from the Grantee’s wages or other cash compensation payable to the Grantee; (iii) withholding from\nproceeds of the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Restricted Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale\narranged by the Company (on Grantee’s behalf pursuant to this authorization); (iv) withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting/settlement of the\nRestricted Stock Units; or (v) any other method of withholding determined by the Company and to the extent required by applicable law or the Plan, approved by the\nCommittee.\n(c) The Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax Obligations by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including\nminimum or maximum rates applicable in the Grantee's jurisdiction(s) so long as such withholding or accounting does not result in adverse treatment for financial accounting\npurposes. In the event of over-withholding, the Grantee may receive a refund from the Company and/or the Service Recipient of any over-withheld amount in cash (with no\nentitlement to the equivalent in Shares), or if not refunded by the Company and/or the Service Recipient, the Grantee must seek a refund from the local tax authorities to the\nextent the Grantee wishes to recover the over-withheld amount in the form of a refund. If the obligation for Tax Obligations is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax\npurposes, the Grantee shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of Shares\nare held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Obligations due as a result of any aspect of the Grantee’s participation in the Plan. The Company and/or the Service\nRecipient may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds from the sale of Shares to the Grantee if the Grantee fails to comply with the Grantee's obligations in\nconnection with the Tax Obligations.\n(d) Finally, the Grantee shall pay to the Company and/or the Service Recipient any amount of Tax Obligations that the Company and/or the Service Recipient\nmay be required to withhold or account for as a result of the Grantee’s participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Grantee\nhereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the underlying Shares, any cash payments receivable at settlement or the proceeds of the\nsale of Shares, if the Grantee fails to comply with his or her obligations in connection with the Tax Obligations.\n5. Restricted Stock Units and Interests Not Transferable. No Restricted Stock Units or any interest or right therein or part thereof shall be liable for the debts,\ncontracts or engagements of the Grantee or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance,\nassignment or any other means whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or\nequitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect.\nEmployee (non-US) Restricted Stock Unit Agreement | 2\n6.

After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Grantee shall have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including with respect to the right to vote the\nShares and the right to receive any cash or share dividends or other distributions paid to or made with respect to the Shares.\n7. Restrictions on Resale. The Grantee hereby agrees not to sell any Shares at a time when applicable laws, Company policies or an agreement between the\nCompany and/or its underwriters prohibit a sale. This restriction (if any) will apply as long as the Grantee’s service continues and for such period of time after the Grantee’s\nTermination of Service as the Company may specify.\n8. Adjustments.

In case of long-term capital gains, you may be eligible to\ncertain deductions based on specified reinvestments, subject to prescribed conditions.\nIf you hold the shares for 24 months or less, you will be taxed at your marginal nicome tax rate (plus\neducation and health cess and, if applicable, surcharge).\nIf your sale proceeds are lower than your cost basis in the shares, you will realize a loss. Capital losses (short-\nterm or long-term) may be offset against other capital gains of the same nature (i.e., short-term or long-term) that you\nrealize in the same tax year or in any subsequent tax year up to a maximum of 8 years. Long-term capital loss cannot\nbe set off against short-term capital gains. Income tax returns is required to be filed within the due date in order to be\neligible to carry forward capital losses, if any.\nThe calculation of capital gains (losses) at the time of sale is complex and you should consult with your personal\ntax advisor.\nTaxation in the U.S. Assuming you are not a U.S. tax resident and have provided the Company and/or the broker with a Form W-8BEN\nto certify your status as a non-U.S. person, you will not be subject to tax in the U.S. on any gain you realize when\nshares acquired under the Plan are sold. If you have not provided a Form W-8BEN, the broker will perform U.S. back-\nup withholding on the gain at a rate of 24%.\nEmployee (non-US) Restricted Stock Unit Agreement | 10\nYOUR TAX REPORTING AND PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS\nVesting You are required to report the taxable income in your income tax return (“ITR”) based on the amount reported by\nyour employer in Form 16 and pay any additional tax due.\nThe deadline for filing the ITR is July 31.\nSale of Shares You will be responsible for reporting and paying any tax resulting from the sale of shares.\nCapital gains tax is payable under the Advance Tax System during the fiscal year (i.e., April 1 – March 31) in four\n(4) installments, as follows:\n• On or before June 15 – not less than 15% of the tax payable for the year;\n• On or before September 15 – not less than 45% of the tax payable for the year, reduced by the amount paid in\nthe earlier installment.\n• On or before December 15 – not less than 75% of the tax payable for the year, reduced by the amount paid in\nthe earlier installment; and\n• On or before March 15 – the whole amount of the tax payable for the year, reduced by the amount paid in the\nearlier installments.\nPayments are due pursuant to the above schedule based on the date that you realize a capital gain. For example, if\nyou realize a capital gain in October, you must pay not less than 75% of the tax due on such capital gain by December\n15 and the remaining tax due by the applicable dates. If you fail to pay the required amount of capital gains tax\naccording to the above schedule, you will be liable for interest at a rate of 1% per month on the amount of the\nunderpayment.\nIn addition, you are required to report any capital gain/loss in your ITR under I“ncome from Capital Gains”.\nYou must also report any shares held at any time during the applicable tax year (April 1 – March 31) in Schedule\nForeign Assets in the ITR.\nThe deadline for filing the ITR is July 31.\nEmployee (non-US) Restricted Stock Unit Agreement | 11\nOTHER INFORMATION\nForeign Asset/Account Reporting You are required to declare your foreign bank accounts and any foreign financial assets (including shares held\noutside India) in your annual tax return.\nAs the reporting rules are stringent, you should consult with your personal tax or legal advisor regarding this\nreporting obligation.\nExchange Control You are required to repatriate the cash proceeds received upon the sale of shares and convert such proceeds\ninto local currency within specified timeframes as required under applicable regulations. You also are required to\nretain the foreign inward remittance certificate as evidence of repatriation.\nAs exchange control regulations can change frequently and without notice, you should consult your personal tax\nor legal advisor before selling your shares to ensure compliance with current regulations.\nU.S. Estate Tax You should be aware that U.S. estate tax may be assessed at the time of death if you hold Company shares\n(and certain awards) at this time. U.S. estate tax law requires that, for the estates of non-U.S. citizens who reside\noutside the U.S. (“non-resident aliens”), an estate tax return must be filed if the gross estate exceeds USD 60,000,\nthough if an estate tax treaty applies, the consequences will differ. The gross estate of a non-resident alien consists\nonly of assets located in the U.S., which will include your Company shares (and certain awards granted under the\nPlan). Due to the complexity of these laws, your heirs should consult with a personal tax or financial advisor.\nExample:\nThe following example assumes you received a grant of RSUs for 10 shares, which vest on a certain date.\nOn the vest date, the value of the shares subject to your RSUs is $10. On the date you sell the shares acquired upon vesting of the RSUs, the value of the shares is $15.\nOn the vest date, the Company withholds/sells shares to cover withholding taxes due at vesting. You are required to pay applicable taxes at sale.\nNote the below is a hypothetical example only and is not meant to predict the RSUs in which you may vest (if any), nor the price of the shares on the vest date or on the\ndate of sale of the shares. The price of the shares subject to your RSUs may decrease after the vest date, in which case you would not realize a capital gain.

Purpose 1\n2. Requirement to Recover Compensation 1\n3. Definitions 1\n4. Exceptions 3\n5. Manner of Recovery 4\n6. Other Provision 5\n7. Other Recovery Rights 5\nCompensation Recovery Policy\n1. Purpose. In accordance with the applicable rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”) and Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (“Rule 10D-1”), the Board of Directors of Energy Recovery, Inc. (the\n“Company”) has adopted this Compensation Recovery Policy (this “Policy”). The purpose of this Policy is to describe the circumstances\nunder which the Company is required to recover certain compensation paid to certain executive officers. Any references in compensation\nplans, agreements, equity awards, or other policies to the Company’s “recoupment,” “clawback,” or similarly named policy will mean this\nPolicy.\n2. Requirement to Recover Compensation. In the event that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company,\nthrough its Board of Directors (the “Board”) or its Compensation Committee (if such committee is comprised entirely of independent\ndirectors (the “Committee”)) will recover reasonably promptly from any Executive Officer the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation Received during the Recovery Period.\n3. Definitions. For purposes of this Policy, the following terms, when capitalized, will have the meanings set forth below:\n(a) “Accounting Restatement” means any accounting restatement required due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any financial\nreporting requirement under the securities law, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued\nfinancial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the\nerror were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\n(b) “Executive Officer” means each individual who is currently or was previously designated as an “officer” of the Company as defined in\nRule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the identification of an Executive Officer for purposes of this Policy\nwill include each executive officer who is or was identified pursuant to Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K, as well as the Company’s\nprincipal executive officer; principal financial officer; principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the\ncontroller); any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales, administration,\nor finance); any other officer who performs a significant policy-making function; or any other person who performs similar significant\npolicy-making functions for the Company; provided, that such person was an Executive Officer in both the fiscal period for which the\nAccounting Restatement is required and at the time the Erroneously Awarded Compensation was Received. An executive officer of the\nCompany’s parent(s) or subsidiaries will be deemed an “Executive Officer” if he or she performs such policy-making functions for the\nCompany.\n(c) “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation Received by an Executive Officer that\nexceeds the amount of Recalculated Compensation, provided such compensation was Received while the Company has a class of\nsecurities listed on the Nasdaq.\n– 1 –\nCompensation Recovery Policy\n(d) “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment\nof a financial reporting measure. A financial reporting measure is a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from\nsuch measures, regardless of whether any such measure is presented within the financial statements or included in a filing with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). For these purposes, stock price and total shareholder return are considered financial\nreporting measures. For the avoidance of doubt, incentive-based compensation subject to this Policy does not include salaries, bonuses\npaid solely at the discretion of the Board or the Committee that are not paid from a “bonus pool” that is determined by satisfying a\nfinancial reporting measure performance goal, bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards (for example,\ndemonstrated leadership) and/or completion of a specified employment period, non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon\nsatisfying one or more strategic measures (for example, consummating a merger or divestiture), or operational measures (for example,\nopening a specified number of stores, completion of a project, increase in market share); and equity awards (stock options, restricted\nstock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or similar equity-based awards) for which the grant is not contingent upon achieving any\nfinancial reporting measure performance goal and vesting is contingent solely upon completion of a specified employment or service\nperiod, the passage of time, and/or attaining one or more non-financial reporting measures.\n(e) “Recalculated Compensation” means the Incentive-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received had it been\ndetermined based on the Accounting Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. For Incentive-Based Compensation based\non stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical\nrecalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of the Recalculated Compensation must be based\non a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return, as the case may be,\nupon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received. The Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that\nreasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Nasdaq.\n(f) Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure\nspecified in the award of such Incentive-Based Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based\nCompensation occurs after the end of that period.\n(g) “Recovery Period” means the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the date the Company is required to\nprepare an Accounting Restatement; provided that the Recovery Period will not begin before October 2, 2023. For purposes of\ndetermining the Recovery Period, the Company is considered to be “required to prepare an Accounting Restatement” on the earlier to\noccur of:\n– 2 –\nCompensation Recovery Policy\n(i) the date the Company’s Board of Directors, a committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, or the officer or officers of the\nCompany authorized to take such action if Board of Directors’ action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have\nconcluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement; or\n(ii) the date a court, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.\nIf the Company changes its fiscal year, then the transition period within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years also\nwill be included in the Recovery Period, provided, however, that if the transition period between the last day of the Company’s previous\nfiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year comprises a period of nine to 12 months, then such transition period will be deemed\na completed fiscal year and one of the three completed fiscal years and will not extend the length of the Recovery Period.\n4. Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation will not be required to\nthe extent the Committee, or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board, has made a\ndetermination that such recovery would be impracticable and one of the following conditions have been satisfied:\n(a) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided, however,\nthat, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Incentive-\nBased Compensation based on the expense of enforcement, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to the Nasdaq.\n(b) Recovery would violate home country law where, with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation, that law was adopted prior to\nNovember 28, 2022; provided, however, that, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation that was Incentive-Based Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company must obtain an\nopinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the national securities exchange or national securities association on which its class of\nsecurities are listed, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the Nasdaq.\n(c) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and the regulations thereunder.\n– 3 –\nCompensation Recovery Policy\n5. Manner of Recovery. After an Accounting Restatement, the Company’s Board of Directors or the Committee will determine the amount of\nany Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by each Executive Officer and will promptly notify each Executive Officer with a written\nnotice containing the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return of such compensation, as\napplicable.\n(a) The Company’s Board of Directors or the Committee will have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation based on the particular facts and circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Section 4\nabove, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in\nsatisfaction of an Executive Officer’s obligations hereunder.\n(b) To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received\nunder any duplicative recovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, it will be appropriate for any such reimbursed\namount to be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\n(c) In addition to any other actions permitted by law or contract, the Company’s Board of Directors or the Committee may take any or all of\nthe following actions to recover any Erroneously Awarded Compensation:\n(i) require the Executive Officer to repay such amount;\n(ii) offset such amount from any other compensation owed by the Company or any of its affiliates to the Executive Officer, regardless\nof whether the contract or other documentation governing such other compensation specifically permits or specifically prohibits\nsuch offsets; and\n(iii) to the extent the Erroneously Awarded Compensation was deferred into a plan of deferred compensation, whether or not qualified,\nforfeit such amount (as well as the earnings on such amounts) from the Executive Officer’s balance in such plan, regardless of\nwhether the plan specifically permits or specifically prohibits such forfeiture.\nIf the Erroneously Awarded Compensation consists of shares of the Company’s common stock, and the Executive Officer still owns such\nshares, then the Company may satisfy its recovery obligations by requiring the Executive Officer to transfer such shares back to the\nCompany.\n(d) To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company’s\nBoard of Directors or the Company will take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nfrom the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive Officer will be required to reimburse the Company for any and all\nexpenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in\naccordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n– 4 –\nCompensation Recovery Policy\n6. Other Provisions.\n(a) This Policy will be administered and interpreted, and may be amended from time to time, by the Company’s Board of Directors or the\nCommittee, and the determinations of the Board of Directors or the Committee will be binding on all Executive Officers.\n(b) The Company will not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer (or former Executive Officer) against the loss of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned, or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or any claims relating to\nthe Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company will not enter into any agreement that exempts any\nIncentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid, or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of this Policy or that waives\nthe Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy will supersede any such agreement\n(whether entered into before, on, or after the Effective Date of this Policy.\n(c) The Company will file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the Federal securities laws,\nincluding the disclosure required by the applicable SEC filings.\n(d) Any right to recovery under this Policy will be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights of recovery that may be available to the\nCompany; provided, however, that any determination by the Company’s Board of Directors or the Committee to recover or forfeit\nawards made or amounts received due to an Accounting Restatement will be made in a manner consistent with this Policy.\n(e) The Company’s Board of Directors or the Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and will amend this\nPolicy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6 to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy will\nbe effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously\nwith such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any Federal securities laws, SEC rule, or Nasdaq rule.\n7. Other Recovery Rights. This Policy will be binding and enforceable against all Executive Officers and, to the extent required by applicable\nlaw or guidance from the SEC or the Nasdaq, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators, or other legal representatives. The\nCompany’s Board of Directors and the Committee intend that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent required by applicable law. Any\nemployment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, or any other agreement or arrangement with an Executive Officer will\nbe deemed to include, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the Executive Officer to abide by the terms of\nthis Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery that may be\navailable to the Company under applicable law, regulation, or rule or pursuant to the terms of any policy of the Company or any provision in\nany employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan, agreement, or other arrangement.\n– 5 –"
