(NASDAQ: XEL) (Xcel Energy) announced today the closing of its registered underwritten offering of 18,320,610 shares of its common stock in connection with the forward sale agreements described below. Barclays and BofA Securities acted as joint lead book-running managers for the offering. Citigroup and Wells Fargo Securities acted as joint book-running managers for the offering. \n\nThe closing will result in approximately $1.18 billion of net proceeds, before expenses (assuming each forward sale agreement is physically settled based on the initial forward sale price per share of $64.4356, as described more fully below). \n\nIn connection with the offering, Xcel Energy entered into separate forward sale agreements with each of Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of America, N.A. (in such capacity, the forward purchasers) under which Xcel Energy agreed to issue and sell to the forward purchasers an aggregate of 18,320,610 shares of its common stock at the initial forward sale price of $64.4356. In addition, the underwriters of the offering have been granted a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,748,091 shares of Xcel Energy’s common stock upon the same terms. If the underwriters exercise their option, Xcel Energy may elect to enter into additional forward sale agreements with the forward purchasers with respect to the additional shares or to issue and sell such shares directly to the underwriters. \n\nSettlement of the forward sale agreements is expected to occur on or prior to June 30, 2026. Upon any physical settlement of each forward sale agreement, Xcel Energy will issue and deliver to the relevant forward purchaser shares of Xcel Energy’s common stock in exchange for cash proceeds per share, based on the initial forward sale price of $64.4356. The initial forward sale price will be subject to certain adjustments as provided in the relevant forward sale agreement. Xcel Energy may, subject to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of its rights or obligations under either of the forward sale agreements. \n\nIn connection with the forward sale agreements, the forward purchasers borrowed from third-party lenders and sold to the underwriters 18,320,610 shares of Xcel Energy’s common stock at the close of the offering. \n\nIf Xcel Energy elects physical settlement of either of the forward sale agreements, it presently expects to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include capital contributions to its utility subsidiaries, acquisitions, and/or repayment of short-term debt. \n\nThe offering was made pursuant to Xcel Energy’s effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus related to the offering are available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=54147414&newsitemid=20241105608233&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=1&md5=0e82ffb749028b840d5b8e043a0239bd).

wildfires: party wildfire damages under state law\n‒ Presumed prudence if following approved plan • Require wildfire mitigation plans to access\nfederal fund\n• Develop cooperative plans with other local\npartners and industries • Address insurance, federal lands and other\nassociated issues\n• Secure state programs for wildfire prevention\n• Create backstop state fund\n35\nSmokehouse Creek Fire\n• Our distribution poles appear to have been involved in an ignition of the Smokehouse Creek Fire and the\nsmaller Reamer Fire (which burned into the Smokehouse Creek Fire)\n– We dispute claims that we acted negligently in maintaining and operating our infrastructure\n– We have established a claims process for those impacted by the Smokehouse Creek Fire\n– Received 179 claims\n– 86 claims resolved\n– 23 lawsuits filed\n• We accrued a liability of $215 million with an offsetting insurance receivable (liability based on current\ninformation and subject to change)\n• We have approximately $500 million of insurance to cover potential 2024 policy period losses\n• Xcel Energy is unable to reasonably estimate an upper end of the loss range due to unknown facts and\nlegal considerations that may impact the potential liability\n36\nMarshall Wildfire\n• Xcel Energy agrees with the Sheriff that Twelve Tribes caused the first ignition – which was burning\nfor more than an hour before the second ignition\n• We strongly disagree with the conclusions in the Sheriff’s report that we caused the second ignition,\nwhich reportedly started 80 to 110 feet away from Xcel Energy’s power lines\n• The Sherriff’s report stated that it cannot be ruled out that the second ignition was caused by an\nunderground coal fire\n• Colorado courts do not apply strict liability. For negligence claims, Colorado courts look to whether a\nutility operated its system with a heightened duty of care consistent with the practical conduct of its\nbusiness, and liability does not extend to occurrences that cannot be reasonably anticipated\n• The Sheriff’s report stated that no design, installation or maintenance defects were identified on our\nelectrical circuit in the area of the second ignition\n• Target trial date: September 2025. Trial will focus on determination of liability (vs damages)\n37\nMarshall Fire Spread Timeline\nBy the time of the second ignition (~12:20 p.m.), fire from first ignition had already spread to Superior\n​\n(1) Approximately 11 a.m. – First ignition\non Twelve Tribe’s property\n(2) 12:03 p.m. – Fire reported past Howard\nBarry Water Treatment Plant\n2\n(3) 12:06 p.m. – “Flames reported at the\nback of Sagamore subdivision” 4\n1\n(4) 12:08 p.m. – Video shows embers\nshowering Costco parking lot at 600\n3\nMarshall Road, approx. 3 miles from the 5\nlocation of first ignition\n(5) Approximately 12:20 p.m. – Second\nignition at Marshall Mesa Trailhead Area\n38\nMarshall Fire Spread Timeline\nRed/Orange Dots Show Property Damage Fire Spread Leading to Time of Second Ignition\nSource: Denver Post\n39\nFINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT\n40\nStrong Balance Sheet and Credit Metrics\nPlan 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029\nFFO/Debt ~17% ~17% ~17% ~17% ~17% ~17%\nDebt/EBITDA 5.3x 5.6x 5.4x 5.3x 5.1x 5.0x\nEquity Ratio 40% 41% 41% 41% 41% 41%\nHold Co Debt/Total Debt 24% 23% 21% 22% 22% 22%\nCredit Ratings Moody’s S&P Fitch\nXcel Energy Unsecured Baa1 BBB BBB+\nNSPM Secured Aa3 A A+\nNSPW Secured A1 A A+\nPSCo Secured A1 A A+\nSPS Secured A3 A- A-\nCredit metrics based on base capital forecast, include tax credit transferability, and do not reflect rating agency adjustments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Investor Relations Earnings Release (Unaudited)\nDue to the seasonality of Xcel Energy’s operating results, quarterly financial results are not an appropriate base from which to\nproject annual results.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures such as ongoing return on equity (ROE), ongoing earnings and\nongoing diluted EPS. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of a company’s financial performance, financial\nposition or cash flows that adjusts measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy’s management\nuses non-GAAP measures for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of Directors, in determining\nperformance-based compensation and communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of our performance and should not be considered alternatives for\nfinancial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are discussed in more detail below and may not be\ncomparable to other companies’ similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures.\nOngoing ROE\nOngoing ROE is calculated by dividing the net income or loss of Xcel Energy or each subsidiary, adjusted for certain\nnonrecurring items, by each entity’s average stockholder’s equity. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and\nprovide details of earnings results.\nEarnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings and Ongoing Diluted EPS)\nGAAP diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock (i.e.,\ncommon stock equivalents) were settled. The weighted average number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding used to\ncalculate Xcel Energy Inc.’s diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury stock method. Ongoing earnings reflect adjustments to\nGAAP earnings (net income) for certain items. Ongoing diluted EPS for Xcel Energy is calculated by dividing net income or\nloss, adjusted for certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the\nperiod. Ongoing diluted EPS for each subsidiary is calculated by dividing the net income or loss for such subsidiary, adjusted\nfor certain items, by the weighted average fully diluted Xcel Energy Inc. common shares outstanding for the period.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of Xcel Energy’s core earnings and underlying\nperformance. For instance, to present ongoing earnings and ongoing diluted earnings per share, we may adjust the related\nGAAP amounts for certain items that are non-recurring in nature. We believe these measurements are useful to investors to\nevaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our subsidiaries. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures should not be considered as an alternative to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.\n4\nNote 1. Earnings Per Share Summary\nXcel Energy’s third quarter GAAP earnings were $1.21 per share, compared with $1.19 per share in the same period in 2023\nand ongoing earnings were $1.25 per share in 2024, compared with $1.23 per share in 2023. The change in earnings per share\nwas primarily driven by increased recovery of infrastructure investments, partially offset by higher depreciation, interest\ncharges and O&M expenses. Fluctuations in electric and natural gas revenues associated with changes in fuel and purchased\npower and/or natural gas sold and transported generally do not significantly impact earnings (changes in costs are offset by the\nrelated variation in revenues). See Note 6 for reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.\nSummarized diluted EPS for Xcel Energy:\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30 Nine Months Ended Sept. 30\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNSP-Minnesota $ 0.45 $ 0.47 $ 1.06 $ 0.95\nPSCo 0.45 0.41 1.06 0.97\nSPS 0.31 0.30 0.58 0.55\nNSP-Wisconsin 0.07 0.06 0.19 0.18\nEarnings from equity method investments — WYCO 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.03\nRegulated utility (a) 1.29 1.25 2.91 2.68\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other (0.08) (0.06) (0.28) (0.22)\nGAAP diluted EPS (a) $ 1.21 $ 1.19 2.63 2.47\nLoss on Comanche Unit 3 litigation (b) — $ 0.05 — 0.05\nSherco Unit 3 2011 outage refunds (b) 0.04 $ — 0.06 —\nOngoing diluted EPS (a) $ 1.25 $ 1.23 2.69 2.52\n(a) Amounts may not add due to rounding.\n(b) See Note 6.\nNSP-Minnesota — GAAP earnings decreased $0.02 per share and ongoing earnings increased 0.02 per share for the third\nquarter. Year-to-date GAAP earnings increased $0.11 per share and ongoing earnings increased $0.17 per share. Year-to-date\nearnings primarily reflect increased recovery of infrastructure investments (electric and natural gas), partially offset by higher\ndepreciation and interest charges. See Note 6 for reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.\nPSCo — GAAP earnings increased $0.04 per share and ongoing earnings increased $0.01 per share for the third quarter. Year-\nto-date GAAP earnings increased $0.09 per share and ongoing earnings increased $0.04 per share. Year-to-date ongoing\nearnings primarily reflect higher recovery of electric infrastructure investments, which was partially offset by increased interest\ncharges, depreciation and O&M expenses. See Note 6 for reconciliation from GAAP to ongoing earnings.\nSPS — GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.01 per share for the third quarter of 2024 and $0.03 year-to-date. Year-to-\ndate earnings reflect the impact of regulatory rate outcomes and sales growth, partially offset by increased depreciation and\nO&M expenses.\nNSP-Wisconsin — GAAP and ongoing earnings increased $0.01 per share for the third quarter of 2024 and year-to-date. Year-\nto-date earnings reflect the impact of electric infrastructure investment recoveries, partially offset by higher depreciation and\ninterest expenses.\nXcel Energy Inc. and Other — Primarily includes financing costs and interest income at the holding company and earnings\nfrom investment funds, which are accounted for as equity method investments. The decline in earnings is largely due to\nincreased interest rates and higher debt levels.\n5\nComponents significantly contributing to changes in 2024 EPS compared to 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share Sept. 30 Sept. 30\nGAAP diluted EPS — 2023 $ 1.19 $ 2.47\nComponents of change - 2024 vs. 2023\nElectric regulatory rate outcomes and riders 0.24 0.65\nHigher AFUDC 0.04 0.12\nNatural gas regulatory rate outcomes and riders 0.01 0.06\nLoss on Comanche Unit 3 litigation (See Note 6) 0.05 0.05\nHigher depreciation and amortization (0.08) (0.31)\nHigher interest charges (0.08) (0.20)\nHigher O&M expenses (0.09) (0.08)\nSherco Unit 3 2011 outage refunds (See Note 6) (0.04) (0.06)\nOther, net (0.03) (0.07)\nGAAP diluted EPS — 2024 1.21 2.63\nSherco Unit 3 2011 outage refunds (See Note 6) 0.04 0.06\nOngoing diluted EPS — 2024 $ 1.25 $ 2.69\nNote 2. Regulated Utility Results\nEstimated Impact of Temperature Changes on Regulated Earnings — Unusually hot summers or cold winters increase\nelectric and natural gas sales, while mild weather reduces electric and natural gas sales. The estimated impact of weather on\nearnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances, the amount of natural gas or electricity historically used\nper degree of temperature and excludes any incremental related operating expenses that could result due to storm activity or\nvegetation management requirements. As a result, weather deviations from normal levels can affect Xcel Energy’s financial\nperformance. However, electric sales true-up and gas decoupling mechanism in Minnesota predominately mitigate the positive\nand adverse impacts of weather in that jurisdiction.\nNormal weather conditions are defined as either the 10, 20 or 30-year average of actual historical weather conditions. The\nhistorical period of time used in the calculation of normal weather differs by jurisdiction, based on regulatory practice. To\ncalculate the impact of weather on demand, a demand factor is applied to the weather impact on sales. Extreme weather\nvariations, windchill and cloud cover may not be reflected in weather-normalized estimates.\nWeather — Estimated impact of temperature variations on EPS compared with normal weather conditions:\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30 Nine Months Ended Sept. 30\n2024 vs. 2023 vs. 2024 vs. 2024 vs. 2023 vs. 2024 vs.\nNormal Normal 2023 Normal Normal 2023\nRetail electric $ 0.038 $ 0.032 $ 0.006 $ 0.015 $ 0.035 $ (0.020)\nDecoupling and sales true-up (0.001) 0.007 (0.008) 0.040 (0.015) 0.055\nElectric total $ 0.037 $ 0.039 $ (0.002) $ 0.055 $ 0.020 $ 0.035\nFirm natural gas (0.002) (0.002) — (0.040) 0.024 (0.064)\nDecoupling (0.001) 0.001 (0.002) 0.017 0.001 0.016\nNatural gas total $ (0.003) $ (0.001) $ (0.002) $ (0.023) $ 0.025 $ (0.048)\nTotal $ 0.034 $ 0.038 $ (0.004) $ 0.032 $ 0.045 $ (0.013)\n6\nSales — Sales growth (decline) for actual and weather-normalized sales in 2024 compared to 2023:\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30\nPSCo NSP-Minnesota SPS NSP-Wisconsin Xcel Energy\nActual\nElectric residential 4.1 % (2.7) % (2.3) % (1.0) % — %\nElectric C&I 1.2 (2.2) 9.4 (0.6) 2.3\nTotal retail electric sales 2.1 (2.4) 7.0 (0.7) 1.5\nFirm natural gas sales (3.4) (3.8) N/A 6.6 (3.0)\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30\nPSCo NSP-Minnesota SPS NSP-Wisconsin Xcel Energy\nWeather-Normalized\nElectric residential — % (0.8) % (0.1) % (1.3) % (0.5) %\nElectric C&I (0.4) (1.6) 9.8 (0.6) 2.2\nTotal retail electric sales (0.3) (1.4) 8.0 (0.8) 1.3\nFirm natural gas sales (2.7) (3.5) N/A 6.7 (2.4)\nNine Months Ended Sept. 30\nPSCo NSP-Minnesota SPS NSP-Wisconsin Xcel Energy\nActual\nElectric residential 4.1 % (6.2) % 1.5 % (4.8) % (1.2) %\nElectric C&I 0.3 (3.7) 8.0 (1.9) 1.0\nTotal retail electric sales 1.6 (4.5) 6.7 (2.7) 0.3\nFirm natural gas sales (8.7) (12.7) N/A (11.5) (10.1)\nNine Months Ended Sept. 30\nPSCo NSP-Minnesota SPS NSP-Wisconsin Xcel Energy\nWeather-Normalized\nElectric residential 0.2 % (0.3) % (1.1) % (1.9) % (0.4) %\nElectric C&I (1.1) (2.5) 7.9 (1.5) 1.0\nTotal retail electric sales (0.7) (1.8) 6.3 (1.6) 0.6\nFirm natural gas sales 1.7 0.4 N/A (2.3) 1.0\nNine Months Ended Sept. 30 (Leap Year Adjusted)\nPSCo NSP-Minnesota SPS NSP-Wisconsin Xcel Energy\nWeather-Normalized\nElectric residential (0.2) % (0.7) % (1.5) % (2.3) % (0.7) %\nElectric C&I (1.5) (2.8) 7.5 (1.9) 0.7\nTotal retail electric sales (1.1) (2.1) 5.9 (2.0) 0.2\nFirm natural gas sales 0.8 (0.5) N/A (3.1) 0.1\n7\nWeather-normalized and leap-year adjusted electric sales growth (decline) — year-to-date\n• PSCo — Residential sales declined due to a 1.5% decrease in use per customer, partially offset by customer growth of\n1.4%. The C&I sales decline was related to decreased use per customer, primarily in the information sector.\n• NSP-Minnesota — Residential sales declined due to a 2.2% decrease in use per customer, partially offset by a 1.5%\nincrease in customers. C&I sales declined due to decreased use per customer, largely in the manufacturing, retail trade\nand education sectors.\n• SPS — Residential sales declined as a result of a 2.2% decrease in use per customer, partially offset by 0.6% customer\ngrowth. C&I sales increased due to higher use per customer, primarily driven by the energy sector and cryptocurrency\nmining.\n• NSP-Wisconsin — Residential sales declined due to a 3.2% decrease in use per customer, partially offset by 0.9%\nincrease in customers. C&I sales decline was associated with decreased use per customer, experienced largely in the\nmanufacturing and professional services sectors.\nWeather-normalized and leap-year adjusted natural gas sales growth (decline) — year-to-date\n• Increase in natural gas sales was driven by residential and C&I customer growth in all jurisdictions and increased\nresidential use per customer in PSCo offset by decreased use per customer in PSCo C&I and other jurisdictions.\nElectric Revenues — Electric revenues are impacted by fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal and uranium, regulatory\noutcomes, market prices and seasonality. In addition, electric customers receive a credit for PTCs generated, which reduce\nelectric revenue and income taxes.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(Millions of Dollars) Sept. 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Sept. 30, 2024 vs. 2023\nRecovery of lower cost of electric fuel and purchased power $ (83) $ (418)\nWholesale generation revenues (45) (76)\nSherco Unit 3 2011 outage refunds (See Note 6) (35) (46)\nPTCs flowed back to customers (offset by lower ETR) (23) (35)\nRegulatory rate outcomes (MN, CO, TX, NM, & WI) 130 363\nNon-fuel riders 43 112\nConservation and demand side management (offset in expense) 39 82\nRevenue recognition for the Texas rate case surcharge (a) 2 39\nEstimated impact of weather (net of sales true-up) (2) 25\nOther, net (20) (60)\nTotal increase $ 6 $ (14)\n(a) Recognition of revenue from the Texas rate case outcome is largely offset by recognition of previously deferred costs.\nNatural Gas Revenues — Natural gas revenues vary with changing sales, the cost of natural gas and regulatory outcomes.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(Millions of Dollars) Sept. 30, 2024 vs. 2023 Sept. 30, 2024 vs. 2023\nRecovery of lower cost of natural gas $ (8) $ (418)\nEstimated impact of weather (net of decoupling) (2) (35)\nRegulatory rate outcomes (MN, WI & ND) 6 41\nRetail sales growth (net of decoupling) 1 10\nInfrastructure and integrity riders 1 6\nOther, net (4) 5\nTotal decrease $ (6) $ (391)\nElectric Fuel and Purchased Power — Expenses incurred for electric fuel and purchased power are impacted by fluctuations\nin market prices of natural gas, coal and uranium, as well as seasonality. These incurred expenses are generally recovered\nthrough various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in these expenses are largely offset in operating revenues\nand have minimal earnings impact.\nElectric fuel and purchased power expenses decreased $121 million for the third quarter and $465 million year-to-date. The\ndecrease is primarily due to timing of fuel recovery mechanisms and lower commodity prices.\n8\nCost of Natural Gas Sold and Transported — Expenses incurred for the cost of natural gas sold are impacted by market prices\nand seasonality. These costs are generally recovered through various regulatory recovery mechanisms. As a result, changes in\nthese expenses are largely offset in operating revenues and have minimal earnings impact.\nNatural gas sold and transported decreased $7 million for the third quarter and $420 million year-to-date. The decrease is\nprimarily due to lower commodity prices and volumes.\nO&M Expenses — O&M expenses increased $69 million for the third quarter and increased $58 million year-to-date. The\nyear-to-date increase was primarily due to operational activities (generation maintenance, damage prevention, storm response\nand wildfire mitigation) and recognition of previously deferred costs associated with the Texas Electric Rate Case, partially\noffset by gain on land sale in the first quarter and lower bad debt expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization — Depreciation and amortization increased $63 million for the third quarter and $235 million\nyear-to-date. The year-to-date increase was largely the result of system expansion partially offset by recognition of previously\ndeferred costs and depreciation rate changes associated with various rate cases.\nInterest Charges — Interest charges increased $57 million for the third quarter and $146 million year-to-date, largely due to\nincreased debt levels and higher interest rates.\nOther Income — Other income increased $36 million for the third quarter and $56 million year-to-date. The year-to-date\nincrease was primarily due to interest earned and rabbi trust performance, which is partially offset in O&M expenses.\nAFUDC, Equity and Debt — AFUDC increased $25 million for the third quarter and $71 million year-to-date, driven by\nincreased investment in renewable and transmission projects.\nIncome Taxes — Effective income tax rate:\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30 Nine Months Ended Sept. 30\n2024 vs. 2024 vs.\n2024 2023 2023 2024 2023 2023\nFederal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % — % 21.0 % 21.0 % — %\nState tax (net of federal tax effect) 4.7 5.0 (0.3) 4.8 4.9 (0.1)\n(Decreases) increases:\nWind PTCs (a) (16.0) (13.8) (2.2) (26.2) (27.3) 1.1\nPlant regulatory differences (b) (5.7) (5.3) (0.4) (5.9) (5.5) (0.4)\nOther tax credits, net NOL & tax credit allowances (1.5) (1.1) (0.4) (1.1) (1.2) 0.1\nOther, net (1.1) (0.1) (1.0) (0.3) 0.1 (0.4)\nEffective income tax rate 1.4 % 5.7 % (4.3) % (7.7) % (8.0) % 0.3 %\n(a) PTCs (net of transfer discounts) are generally credited to customers (reduction to revenue) and do not materially\nimpact earnings.\n(b) Plant regulatory differences primarily relate to the credit of excess deferred taxes to customers.

Rates, Regulation and Other\nNSP-Minnesota — 2024 Minnesota Natural Gas Rate Case — In November 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the\nMinnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for a natural gas rate increase of approximately $59 million, or 9.6%. The\nrequest was based on a ROE of 10.2%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a 2024 forward test year with rate base of approximately $1.27\nbillion. In December 2023, the MPUC approved NSP-Minnesota’s request for interim rates, subject to refund, of approximately\n$51 million (implemented on Jan. 1, 2024).\n11\nIn June 2024, NSP-Minnesota and various parties filed an uncontested settlement, which includes the following terms:\n• Natural gas rate increase of $46 million, or 7.5%.\n• ROE of 9.6%.\n• Equity ratio of 52.5%.\n• Rate base of $1.25 billion.\n• No change to Commission approved decoupling.\nIn October 2024, an ALJ recommended the MPUC approve the rate case settlement. A MPUC decision and order is expected in\nthe first quarter of 2025.\nNSP-Minnesota — North Dakota Natural Gas Rate Case — In December 2023, NSP-Minnesota filed a request with the\nNorth Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC) seeking an increase in natural gas rates of $8.5 million (9.4%), based on a\nROE of 10.20%, an equity ratio of 52.5%, 2024 test year and rate base of $168 million. In February 2024, the NDPSC approved\ninterim rates of $8 million, effective March 1, 2024.\nIn August 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed a settlement agreement with NDPSC Staff and AARP. Key terms of the settlement\nincluded an increase in natural gas rates of $7.3 million (8.1%), based on a ROE of 9.9% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. A\nNDPSC decision and order is expected by the end of 2024.\nNSP-Minnesota — Minnesota 2023 Fuel Clause Adjustment — In March 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed its annual fuel clause\nadjustment true-up petition to the MPUC.\nIn 2024, the DOC recommended customer refunds for 2023 replacement power costs incurred during an outage at the Prairie\nIsland generating station (October 2023 through February 2024). NSP-Minnesota estimates that customer refunds would be\napproximately $22 million if the DOC recommendations are applied to both 2023 and 2024.\nIn September 2024, the MPUC ruled NSP-Minnesota was imprudent in the operation of the Prairie Island nuclear plant based\non an incident that resulted in the extended outage. The MPUC declined to quantify the refund and referred the determination of\nthe refund amount to the Office of Administrative Hearings. A procedural schedule will be determined in the fourth quarter of\n2024. NSP-Minnesota has recorded an estimated liability for a customer refund.\nNSP-Minnesota — Sherco Unit 3 — In May 2024, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) recommended a customer refund of\n$34 million (less a portion of the proceeds received from the settlement with GE) related to purchase power costs incurred\nduring a Sherco Unit 3 outage that started in 2011. The ALJ indicated that consideration of the $22 million of previously\ndisallowed costs was not in the scope of their recommendation. In October 2024, the MPUC ordered customer refunds of $46\nmillion, which is presented as a non-recurring charge to electric revenues in the three and nine months ended Sept. 30, 2024.\nNSP-Minnesota — 2024 Minnesota Resource Plan Settlement — In February 2024, NSP filed its Upper Midwest Resource\nPlan with the MPUC. In October 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed a settlement with several parties reaching agreement on the\nresource plan, as well as the proposed projects to be approved in the pending 800 MW firm dispatchable resource acquisition.\nNSP-Minnesota anticipates a MPUC decision in 2025 and will file related a RFP for remaining resource needs upon approval.\nThe settlement included the following key items:\n• The selection of the company-owned 420 MW Lyon County combustion turbine.\n• The selection of the company-owned 300 MW 4-hour Sherco battery energy storage system.\n• Multiple PPAs to proceed to the negotiation stage.\n• The addition of 3,200 MW of wind, 400 MW of solar and 600 MW of stand-alone storage to be added through 2030\nbased on an RFP process. Approximately 2,800 MW of wind resources are projected to utilize the Minnesota Energy\nConnection transmission line.\n• Planned life extensions of the Prairie Island and Monticello nuclear plants through the early 2050s.\nNSP-Minnesota — 2024 Electric Rate Case — In early November 2024, NSP-Minnesota plans to file an electric rate case in\nMinnesota, seeking a total revenue increase of $491 million (13.2%) over two years, based on an ROE of 10.3%, a 52.5%\nequity ratio and rate base of $13.2 billion in 2025 and $14 billion in 2026. NSP-Minnesota will also request interim rates of\n$224 million to go into effect in January 2025. A decision is expected in 2026.\n12\nNSP-Wisconsin — Wisconsin 2025 Stay-Out Proposal — In June 2024, NSP-Wisconsin filed a 2025 stay-out proposal with\nthe Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW). The filing proposes to offset 2025 revenue deficiencies of $28 million\nfor electric and $3 million for natural gas by amortizing Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) deferrals, stopping a deferral related to\nIRA benefits ordered in a previous rate case, and deferring revenue requirement impacts of two natural gas capital projects.\nNSP-Wisconsin expects to have a PSCW decision by year-end 2024.\nPSCo — Colorado Natural Gas Rate Case — In January 2024, PSCo, filed a request with the CPUC seeking an increase to\nretail natural gas rates of $171 million (9.5%). The request was based on a 10.25% ROE, an equity ratio of 55%, a 2023 test\nyear and a $4.2 billion year-end rate base.\nIn October 2024, the CPUC issued an order including the following key decisions:\n• Use of a historic 2023 test year, with a 13-month average rate base.\n• Weighted-average cost of capital of 7.0%, based on an ROE range of 9.2%-9.5% and an equity ratio range of 52%-55%.\n• Acceleration of $15 million per year of depreciation expense (incremental to PSCo’s original rate request), to be held in an\nexternal trust for future decommissioning costs.\n• Modifications to recoverability of certain operating expenses.\n• Denial of PSCo’s decoupling proposal.\nBased on the CPUC order, PSCo estimates an annual revenue increase of approximately $130 million, inclusive of $15 million\nof accelerated depreciation, with rates expected to be effective Nov. 5, 2024.\nPSCo — 2024 Colorado Electric Resource Plan — In October, 2024, PSCo filed its electric resource plan, known as the Just\nTransition Solicitation, with the CPUC. The filing reflects the expected growth on the system, the generation resources needed\nto meet the projected growth and the future evaluation of competitive bids for new generation resources.\n• The plan reflects a base sales forecast with 7% compound annual sales growth through 2031.\n• The plan also presents a low sales forecast with a 3% compound annual sales growth through 2031.\n• The resource plan includes forecasted need of 5-14 GW of new generation capacity through 2031, including renewables\nand firm dispatchable resources to meet the two different scenarios. The acquisitions of generation resources will be\ndetermined through a competitive solicitation after the CPUC determines the portfolio. The table below summarizes two of\nthe proposed portfolios based on the different sales scenarios:\n(Megawatts) Base Plan Low Load\nWind 7,250 2,800\nSolar 3,077 1,200\nNatural gas combustion turbine 1,575 1,400\nStorage (long duration) 1,600 —\nOther storage 450 —\nTotal 13,952 5,400\nA CPUC decision on the resource plan is expected by the fall of 2025 (Phase I) with the competitive solicitation for resource\nadditions expected in early 2026.\nPSCo — Wildfire Mitigation Plan — In June 2024, PSCo filed an Updated Wildfire Mitigation Plan (the WMP) and request\nfor recovery of costs covering the years 2025 to 2027 with the CPUC. The estimated total cost for this plan is approximately\n$1.9 billion. A CPUC decision is expected in the third quarter of 2025.\nThe WMP is a key component of keeping our customers and communities safe while providing reliable and affordable electric\nservice. The WMP integrates industry experience; incorporates evolving risk assessment methodologies; adds new technology;\nand expands the scope, pace and scale of our work to reduce wildfire risk in a comprehensive and efficient manner under four\ncore programs that include the following:\n• Situational awareness – Meteorology, area risk mapping and modeling, artificial intelligence cameras and continuous\nmonitoring.\n• Operational mitigations – Enhanced powerline safety settings and public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).\n• System resiliency – Asset assessment and remediations, pole replacements, line rebuilds, targeted undergrounding and\nvegetation management.\n• Customer support – Coordination and real-time data sharing with customers and other stakeholders and PSPS\nresiliency rebates.\n13\nThe procedural schedule is as follows:\n• Answer testimony: Feb. 14, 2025\n• Rebuttal testimony: March 21, 2025\n• Settlement deadline: April 11, 2025\n• Hearing: May 5-15, 2025\n• Decision deadline: Aug. 28, 2025\nPSCo — Excess Liability Insurance Deferral — In August 2024, PSCo filed a request with the CPUC to establish a tracker to\ndefer differences in excess liability insurance premiums after the October 2024 policy renewal (reflecting significantly rising\npremiums, largely associated with wildfire risks throughout the United States) and amounts currently recovered. In October\n2024, the CPUC approved an accelerated procedural schedule which is as follows:\n• Rebuttal testimony: Nov. 1, 2024\n• Settlement deadline: Nov. 12, 2024\n• Hearing: Nov. 21, 2024\n• Target decision date: Dec. 31, 2024\nSPS — New Mexico Resource Plan (IRP) — In October 2023, SPS filed its IRP with the New Mexico Public Regulation\nCommission (NMPRC), which supports projected load growth and increasing reliability requirements, and secures replacement\nenergy and capacity for retiring resources. SPS’ projected resource needs ranging from approximately 5,300 MW to 10,200\nMW by 2030. In February 2024, the NMPRC accepted the IRP.\nIn July 2024, SPS issued a RFP, seeking approximately 3,200 MW of accredited generation capacity by 2030. The total\ncapacity to be added to the system is expected to align with the range identified in the SPS IRP, depending on the types of\nresources proposed in the RFP and their accredited capacity factors.\nThe RFP will be evaluated in the first quarter of 2025. SPS is expected to file for a certificate of need for the recommended\nportfolio in the summer of 2025. The Texas and New Mexico Commissions are expected to rule on the portfolio in 2026.\nNote 5. Wildfire Litigation\n2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex — On February 26, 2024, multiple wildfires began in the Texas Panhandle, including\nthe Smokehouse Creek Fire and the 687 Reamer Fire, which burned into the perimeter of the Smokehouse Creek Fire (together,\nreferred to herein as the “Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex”). The Texas A&M Forest Service issued incident reports that\ndetermined that the Smokehouse Creek Fire and the 687 Reamer Fire were caused by power lines owned by SPS after wooden\npoles near each fire origin failed. According to the Texas A&M Forest Service’s Incident Viewer and news reports, the\nSmokehouse Creek Fire Complex burned approximately 1,055,000 acres.\nSPS is aware of approximately 23 complaints, most of which have also named Xcel Energy Services Inc. as an additional\ndefendant, relating to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex, including one putative class action on behalf of persons or entities\nwho owned rangelands or pastures that were damaged by the fire. The complaints generally allege that SPS’ equipment ignited\nthe Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex and seek compensation for losses resulting from the fire, asserting various causes of\naction under Texas law. In addition to seeking compensatory damages, certain of the complaints also seek exemplary damages.\nSPS has also received approximately 179 claims for losses related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex through its claims\nprocess and has reached final settlements on 86 of those claims. In addition to filed complaints and claims made through SPS’\nclaims process, SPS has also received information from attorneys for claims related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex\nwhich have not been submitted through the claims process and have also not been filed as lawsuits. SPS anticipates additional\ncomplaints and demands will be made. In July 2024, SPS reached a settlement of a complaint related to one of the two fatalities\nbelieved to be associated with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex.\nTexas law does not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company’s liability for fire-related damages. For\nnegligence claims under Texas law, a public utility has a duty to exercise ordinary and reasonable care.\nPotential liabilities related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex depend on various factors, including the cause of the\nequipment failure and the extent and magnitude of potential damages, including damages to residential and commercial\nstructures, personal property, vegetation, livestock and livestock feed (including replacement feed), personal injuries and any\nother damages, penalties, fines or restitution that may be imposed by courts or other governmental entities if SPS is found to\nhave been negligent.\n14\nBased on the current state of the law and the facts and circumstances available as of the date of this filing, Xcel Energy believes\nit is probable that it will incur a loss in connection with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex and accordingly has accrued a\n$215 million estimated loss for the matter (before available insurance), presented in other current liabilities as of Sept. 30, 2024.\nThe aggregate liability of $215 million for claims in connection with the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex (before available\ninsurance) corresponds to the lower end of the range of Xcel Energy’s reasonably estimable range of losses, and is subject to\nchange based on additional information. This $215 million estimate does not include, among other things, amounts for (i)\npotential penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities on Xcel Energy, (ii) exemplary or punitive damages,\n(iii) compensation claims by federal, state, county and local government entities or agencies, (iv) compensation claims for\ndamage to trees, railroad lines, or oil and gas equipment, or (v) other amounts that are not reasonably estimable.\nXcel Energy remains unable to reasonably estimate any additional loss or the upper end of the range because there are a number\nof unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability. In the event that SPS or Xcel\nEnergy Services Inc. was found liable related to the litigation related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex and was required\nto pay damages, such amounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million for the annual policy period\nand could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe process for estimating losses associated with potential claims related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire Complex requires\nmanagement to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including the factors\nidentified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires. As more\ninformation becomes available, management estimates and assumptions regarding the potential financial impact of the\nSmokehouse Creek Fire Complex may change.\nSPS records insurance recoveries when it is deemed probable that recovery will occur, and SPS can reasonably estimate the\namount or range. SPS has recorded an insurance receivable for $215 million, presented within prepayments and other current\nassets as of Sept. 30, 2024. While SPS plans to seek recovery of all insured losses, it is unable to predict the ultimate amount\nand timing of such insurance recoveries.\nMarshall Wildfire Litigation — In December 2021, a wildfire ignited in Boulder County, Colorado (Marshall Fire), which\nburned over 6,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 structures. On June 8, 2023, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office\nreleased its Marshall Fire Investigative Summary and Review and its supporting documents (Sheriff’s Report). According to an\nOctober 2022 statement from the Colorado Insurance Commissioner, the Marshall Fire is estimated to have caused more than\n$2 billion in property losses.\nAccording to the Sheriff’s Report, on Dec. 30, 2021, a fire ignited on a residential property in Boulder, Colorado, located in\nPSCo’s service territory, for reasons unrelated to PSCo’s power lines. According to the Sheriff’s Report, approximately one\nhour and 20 minutes after the first ignition, a second fire ignited just south of the Marshall Mesa Trailhead in unincorporated\nBoulder County, Colorado, also located in PSCo’s service territory. According to the Sheriff’s Report, the second ignition\nstarted approximately 80 to 110 feet away from PSCo’s power lines in the area.\nThe Sheriff’s Report states that the most probable cause of the second ignition was hot particles discharged from PSCo’s power\nlines after one of the power lines detached from its insulator in strong winds, and further states that it cannot be ruled out that\nthe second ignition was caused by an underground coal fire. According to the Sheriff’s Report, no design, installation or\nmaintenance defects or deficiencies were identified on PSCo’s electrical circuit in the area of the second ignition. PSCo\ndisputes that its power lines caused the second ignition.\nPSCo is aware of 307 complaints, most of which have also named Xcel Energy Inc. and Xcel Energy Services Inc. as additional\ndefendants, relating to the Marshall Fire. The complaints are on behalf of at least 4,087 plaintiffs. The complaints generally\nallege that PSCo’s equipment ignited the Marshall Fire and assert various causes of action under Colorado law, including\nnegligence, premises liability, trespass, nuisance, wrongful death, willful and wanton conduct, negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress, loss of consortium and inverse condemnation. In addition to seeking compensatory damages, certain of the complaints\nalso seek exemplary damages.\nIn September 2023, the Boulder County District Court Judge consolidated the pending lawsuits into a single action for pretrial\npurposes and has subsequently consolidated additional lawsuits that have been filed. At the case management conference in\nFebruary 2024, a trial date was set for September 2025. Discovery is now underway.\n15\nIn September 2024, the Judge presiding over the consolidated cases in Boulder County issued an order regarding the trial that\nresolves, on a preliminary basis, certain disputes over the structure of the September 2025 trial. The Court ruled that all\nPlaintiffs should be bound by a trial on liability unless they opt-out with good cause. The Court also ruled that liability and\ndamages should be largely or entirely tried separately, meaning that common questions of law and fact regarding liability would\nbe decided first, and a majority or all of the damages phase will occur separately following the liability phase of trial. The\nindividual plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the opt-out portion of this order, which is currently before the Court.\nColorado courts do not apply strict liability in determining an electric utility company’s liability for fire-related damages. For\ninverse condemnation claims, Colorado courts assess whether a defendant acted with intent to take a plaintiff’s property or\nintentionally took an action which has the natural consequence of taking the property. For negligence claims, Colorado courts\nlook to whether electric power companies have operated their system with a heightened duty of care consistent with the\npractical conduct of its business, and liability does not extend to occurrences that cannot be reasonably anticipated.\nColorado law does not impose joint and several liability in tort actions. Instead, under Colorado law, a defendant is liable for\nthe degree or percentage of the negligence or fault attributable to that defendant, except where the defendant conspired with\nanother defendant. A jury’s verdict in a Colorado civil case must be unanimous. Under Colorado law, in a civil action filed\nbefore Jan. 1, 2025, other than a medical malpractice action, the total award for noneconomic loss is capped at $0.6 million per\ndefendant unless the court finds justification to exceed that amount by clear and convincing evidence, in which case the\nmaximum doubles.\nColorado law caps punitive or exemplary damages to an amount equal to the amount of the actual damages awarded to the\ninjured party, except the court may increase any award of punitive damages to a sum up to three times the amount of actual\ndamages if the conduct that is the subject of the claim has continued during the pendency of the case or the defendant has acted\nin a willful and wanton manner during the action which further aggravated plaintiff’s damages.\nIn the event Xcel Energy Inc. or PSCo was found liable related to this litigation and were required to pay damages, such\namounts could exceed our insurance coverage of approximately $500 million and have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, due to uncertainty as to the cause of the fire and the extent\nand magnitude of potential damages, Xcel Energy Inc. and PSCo are unable to estimate the amount or range of possible losses\nin connection with the Marshall Fire.\nNote 6. Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nXcel Energy’s reported earnings are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Xcel Energy’s management believes that ongoing\nearnings, or GAAP earnings adjusted for certain items, reflect management’s performance in operating the company and\nprovides a meaningful representation of the underlying performance of Xcel Energy’s core business. In addition, Xcel Energy’s\nmanagement uses ongoing earnings internally for financial planning and analysis, for reporting of results to the Board of\nDirectors and when communicating its earnings outlook to analysts and investors. This non-GAAP financial measure should\nnot be considered as an alternative to measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP.\nEarnings Adjusted for Certain Items (Ongoing Earnings)\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP earnings (net income) to ongoing earnings:\nThree Months Ended Sept. 30 Nine Months Ended Sept. 30\n(Millions of Dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nGAAP net income $ 682 $ 656 $ 1,472 $ 1,362\nLoss on Comanche Unit 3 Litigation — 34 — 34\nSherco Unit 3 2011 outage refunds 35 — 46 —\nTax effect (10) (8) (13) (8)\nOngoing earnings $ 707 $ 682 $ 1,505 $ 1,388\nSherco Unit 3 2011 Outage Refunds — NSP-Minnesota’s Sherco Unit 3 experienced an extended outage following a 2011\nincident which damaged its turbine. In October 2024 following contested case procedures, the MPUC ordered a customer\nrefund of $46 million for replacement power incurred during the outage. See Note 4.\n16\nComanche Unit 3 Litigation — In the third quarter of 2023, PSCo recognized a non-recurring $34 million charge (excluded\nfrom on-going earnings) as a result of a jury verdict in Denver County District Court awarding CORE Electric Cooperative lost\npower damages and other costs.\nNote 7. Earnings Guidance and Long-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives\nXcel Energy 2024 Earnings Guidance — Xcel Energy’s 2024 ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.50 to $3.60 per\nshare.(a)\nKey assumptions as compared with 2023 actual levels unless noted:\n• Constructive outcomes in all pending rate case and regulatory proceedings, including requests for deferral of\nincremental insurance costs associated with wildfire risk.\n• Normal weather patterns for the remainder of the year.\n• Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase ~1%.\n• Weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to decline by ~1%.\n• Capital rider revenue is projected to increase $60 million to $70 million (net of PTCs).\n• O&M expenses are projected to increase 3% to 4%.\n• Depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $290 million to $300 million.\n• Property taxes are expected to decline $10 to $20 million.\n• Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $130 million to $140 million, net of interest income.\n• AFUDC - equity is projected to increase $70 million to $80 million.\nXcel Energy 2025 Earnings Guidance — Xcel Energy’s 2025 ongoing earnings guidance is a range of $3.75 to $3.85 per\nshare.(a)\nKey assumptions as compared with 2024 projected levels unless noted:\n• Constructive outcomes in all pending rate case and regulatory proceedings, including requests for deferral of\nincremental insurance costs associated with wildfire risk and recovery of O&M costs associated with wildfire\nmitigation plans.\n• Normal weather patterns for the year.\n• Weather-normalized retail electric sales are projected to increase ~3%.\n• Weather-normalized retail firm natural gas sales are projected to increase ~1%.\n• Capital rider revenue is projected to increase $240 million to $250 million (net of PTCs).\n• O&M expenses are projected to increase ~3%.\n• Depreciation expense is projected to increase approximately $210 million to $220 million.\n• Property taxes are projected to increase $40 million to $50 million.\n• Interest expense (net of AFUDC - debt) is projected to increase $130 million to $140 million, net of interest income.\n• AFUDC - equity is projected to increase $120 million to $130 million.\n(a) Ongoing earnings is calculated using net income and adjusting for certain nonrecurring or infrequent items that are, in\nmanagement’s view, not reflective of ongoing operations. Ongoing earnings could differ from those prepared in\naccordance with GAAP for unplanned and/or unknown adjustments. As Xcel Energy is unable to quantify the financial\nimpacts of any additional adjustments that may occur for the year, we are unable to provide a quantitative\nreconciliation of the guidance for ongoing EPS to corresponding GAAP EPS.\nLong-Term EPS and Dividend Growth Rate Objectives — Xcel Energy expects to deliver an attractive total return to our\nshareholders through a combination of earnings growth and dividend yield, based on the following long-term objectives:\n• Deliver long-term annual EPS growth of 6% to 8% based off of $3.55 per share (the mid-point of 2024 original\nongoing earnings guidance of $3.50 to $3.60 per share).\n• Deliver annual dividend increases of 4% to 6%.\n• Target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60%.\n• Maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range.\n17\nXCEL ENERGY INC.

41\nSmokehouse Creek Fire\n• Our distribution poles appear to have been involved in an ignition of the Smokehouse Creek Fire and the\nsmaller Reamer Fire (which burned into the Smokehouse Creek Fire)\n– We dispute claims that we acted negligently in maintaining and operating our infrastructure\n– We have established a claims process for those impacted by the Smokehouse Creek Fire\n– Received 179 claims\n– 86 settlements resolved\n– 23 lawsuits filed\n• We accrued a liability of $215 million with an offsetting insurance receivable (liability based on current\ninformation and subject to change)\n• We have approximately $500 million of insurance to cover potential 2024 policy period losses\n• Xcel Energy is unable to reasonably estimate an upper end of the loss range due to unknown facts and\nlegal considerations that may impact the potential liability\n42\nMarshall Wildfire\n• Xcel Energy agrees with the Sheriff that Twelve Tribes caused the first ignition – which was burning\nfor more than an hour before the second ignition\n• We strongly disagree with the conclusions in the Sheriff’s report that we caused the second ignition,\nwhich reportedly started 80 to 110 feet away from Xcel Energy’s power lines\n• The Sherriff’s report stated that it cannot be ruled out that the second ignition was caused by an\nunderground coal fire\n• Colorado courts do not apply strict liability. For negligence claims, Colorado courts look to whether a\nutility operated its system with a heightened duty of care consistent with the practical conduct of its\nbusiness, and liability does not extend to occurrences that cannot be reasonably anticipated\n• The Sheriff’s report stated that no design, installation or maintenance defects were identified on our\nelectrical circuit in the area of the second ignition\n• Target trial date: September 2025. Trial will focus on determination of liability (vs damages)\n43\nMarshall Fire Spread Timeline\nBy the time of the second ignition (~12:20 p.m.), fire from first ignition had already spread to Superior\n​\n(1) Approximately 11 a.m. – First ignition\non Twelve Tribe’s property\n(2) 12:03 p.m. – Fire reported past Howard\nBarry Water Treatment Plant\n2\n(3) 12:06 p.m. – “Flames reported at the\nback of Sagamore subdivision” 4\n1\n(4) 12:08 p.m. – Video shows embers\nshowering Costco parking lot at 600\n3\nMarshall Road, approx. 3 miles from the 5\nlocation of first ignition\n(5) Approximately 12:20 p.m. – Second\nignition at Marshall Mesa Trailhead Area\n44\nMarshall Fire Spread Timeline\nRed/Orange Dots Show Property Damage Fire Spread Leading to Time of Second Ignition\nSource: Denver Post\n45\n© 2024 Xcel Energy 46"
