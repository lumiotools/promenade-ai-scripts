Our general merchandise category also grew robustly in the quarter, driven by our efforts in driving better user experience and user mindshare, which were also highlighted by the enthusiastic user response to our Singles Day Grand Promotion this year. We believe we’ve laid a solid foundation for sustainable operational and financial progress in the months and years ahead.\"\n\n“In the third quarter, our total revenues increased by 5.1% year-on-year, resulting from a rebound in growth of electronics and home appliances, and sustained momentum in general merchandise,” said Ian Su Shan, Chief Financial Officer of JD.com. “As we continued to build up supply chain capabilities to drive better scale benefits and operating efficiency, both our gross margin and non-GAAP net margin achieved healthy improvement year-on-year in the quarter. Further highlighting our commitment to shareholder return, in the third quarter we completed our share repurchase program announced in March 2024, and launched a new US$5.0 billion share repurchase program through the end of August 2027. This set of results is attributable to our continuous progress in user growth and engagement, price competitiveness and platform ecosystem.

With years of experience in first-party business model, advanced logistics and fulfillment capabilities and other differentiated supply-chain expertise, JD.com offers customers a wealth of product selections and industry-leading integrated services covering delivery, installation, dismantling and cleaning, along with a seamless process for customers to benefit from the government subsidies effortlessly. JD.com’s trade-in offerings have been well received by customers. In the third quarter, JD.com announced its expansion in the apparel and accessories business, committed to becoming a premier destination for stylish fashion items. By enriching product selections and providing superior shopping experience, the initiative aims to promote the user mindshare of “shopping for clothing on JD.com” while boosting growth for both domestic and international brands.

The Company's cutting-edge retail infrastructure seeks to enable consumers to buy whatever they want, whenever and wherever they want it. The Company has opened its technology and infrastructure to partners, brands and other sectors, as part of its Retail as a Service offering to help drive productivity and innovation across a range of industries.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nIn evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net margin attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders, free cash flow, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“**U.S. GAAP** ”). The Company defines non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations as income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements, gain on sale of development properties and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. The Company defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements and non-compete agreements, gain/(loss) on disposals/deemed disposals of investments and others, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, loss/(gain) from fair value change of long-term investments, impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and investments, gain in relation to sale of development properties and tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. The Company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusting the impact from consumer financing receivables included in the operating cash flow and capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from sale of development properties. Capital expenditures include purchase of property, equipment and software, cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of intangible assets and land use rights. The Company defines non-GAAP EBITDA as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions. Non-GAAP basic net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. Non-GAAP diluted net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the periods, including the dilutive effects of share-based awards as determined under the treasury stock method. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS is equal to non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share multiplied by two.\n\nThe Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP EBITDA reflect the Company's ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from consumer financing receivables included in the operating cash flow and the demands that the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform has placed on financial resources. The Company believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results and business outlook.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The Company encourages you to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**CONTACTS:**\n\n**Investor Relations** Sean Zhang+86 (10) 8912-6804[IR@JD.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ePzH5lrfAHes33-_fIm0TGxR3gO0IZkME9NDe8hh6P2MPoOYP60qpRIqSwKJjtZZFRJcsO8kP67QJZvGHNIANg==)\n\n**Media Relations** +86 (10) 8911-6155[Press@JD.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=H2IOyNgtImZlvVeFZhTYsIdwq5Arog_zSsJGoSUQMgjpIJM8NfJt67cwN-0soVogUERS3L0x78SiYGUgAqRTUQ==)\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

Combined with our progress in building a thriving platform ecosystem, these efforts have led to favorable response from users, with robust user base expansion and user engagement improvement in the quarter. Going forward, we will continue to focus on our own strengths to enhance user experience, price competitiveness and platform ecosystem, which we believe are the fundamentals to ensure sustainable growth in the years to come.”\n\n“In the second quarter, our total revenues increased by 1.2% year-on-year, as we navigated a high base in our electronics and home appliances category from last year, while growth in our general merchandise category, particularly supermarket, remained robust,” said Ian Su Shan, Chief Financial Officer of JD.com. “We continued to enhance price competitiveness during the promotional season through our supply chain and disciplined approach, as opposed to reliance on subsidies. As such, our gross margin substantially increased by 137bps year-on-year to 15.8%, contributing to our record-high operating and net profit on a non-GAAP basis in the quarter. These high-quality results, coupled with our accelerated share repurchase, highlight JD's commitment to creating long-term value for our shareholders.”\n\n**Updates of Share Repurchase Program**\n\nThe Company repurchased a total of 136.8 million Class A ordinary shares (equivalent of 68.4 million ADSs) for a total of US$2.1 billion during the three months ended June 30, 2024.

As the Company repurchased a total of 136.8 million Class A ordinary shares (equivalent of 68.4 million ADSs) for the three months ended June 30, 2024, the potential dilution to the Company’s shareholders upon the conversion of the Notes could be deemed to have been fully offset.\n\nPursuant to the Company's US$3.0 billion share repurchase program which was approved in March 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of approximately US$2.6 billion and the remaining amount was approximately US$0.4 billion as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\n  * **JD Retail:** In the second quarter, JD.com entered into strategic partnership agreements with multiple brands, including Xiaomi, Lenovo and OPPO, to further deepen cooperation with a focus on smart devices, intelligent supply chain, and AI technology integration.

The Company's cutting-edge retail infrastructure seeks to enable consumers to buy whatever they want, whenever and wherever they want it. The Company has opened its technology and infrastructure to partners, brands and other sectors, as part of its Retail as a Service offering to help drive productivity and innovation across a range of industries.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nIn evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders, non-GAAP net margin attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders, free cash flow, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP EBITDA margin, non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share and non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“**U.S. GAAP** ”). The Company defines non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations as income/(loss) from operations excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements, gain on sale of development properties and impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. The Company defines non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders as net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions, effects of business cooperation arrangements and non-compete agreements, gain/(loss) on disposals/deemed disposals of investments and others, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, loss/(gain) from fair value change of long-term investments, impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and investments, gain in relation to sale of development properties and tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments. The Company defines free cash flow as operating cash flow adjusting the impact from consumer financing receivables included in the operating cash flow and capital expenditures, net of the proceeds from sale of development properties. Capital expenditures include purchase of property, equipment and software, cash paid for construction in progress, purchase of intangible assets and land use rights. The Company defines non-GAAP EBITDA as non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of intangible assets resulting from assets and business acquisitions. Non-GAAP basic net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods. Non-GAAP diluted net income/(loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the periods, including the dilutive effect of share-based awards as determined under the treasury stock method. Non-GAAP net income/(loss) per ADS is equal to non-GAAP net income/(loss) per share multiplied by two.\n\nThe Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by management to evaluate operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to the Company's ordinary shareholders and non-GAAP EBITDA reflect the Company's ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Free cash flow enables management to assess liquidity and cash flow while taking into account the impact from consumer financing receivables included in the operating cash flow and the demands that the expansion of fulfillment infrastructure and technology platform has placed on financial resources. The Company believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results and business outlook.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations or not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating performance. The Company encourages you to review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\n\n**CONTACTS:**\n\n**Investor Relations** Sean Zhang+86 (10) 8912-6804[IR@JD.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NWwVX9iwwCPUHlpojMujJDTOKLQTOa6CZ9c7v6GwUnyaiMx8_FXA5AvKGXTPjt6gUr2jNqJ_5lB-0KU0mFR46Q==)\n\n**Media Relations** +86 (10) 8911-6155[Press@JD.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TxJrkcytTo-I3RB7LBiD_o8PXBAOuabT5wdvGOz5sGqFJanfYrp6pSINpW29KmpVIhVITq7CDQk5Rduw-gMPTw==)\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

and\n  * the Reconciliation reflects the proper application of the adjustments and reclassifications to the differences between the Group's accounting policies in accordance with the U.S. GAAP and the IFRSs.\n\n\n\nThe procedures performed by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu were based on their professional judgment, having regard to their understanding of the management's process on preparing the Reconciliation, nature, business performance and financial position of the Group. Given the circumstances of the engagement, the procedures performed included:\n\n(i) Comparing the \"Amounts as recorded under U.S. GAAP\" as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 in the Reconciliation as set out in the Appendix with the Interim 2024 Results prepared in accordance with the U.S. GAAP;(ii) Evaluating the assessment made by the board of directors in identifying the differences between the accounting policies in accordance with the U.S. GAAP and the IFRSs, and the evidence supporting the adjustments and reclassifications made in the Reconciliation in arriving at the \"Amounts as recorded under IFRSs\" in the Reconciliation as set out in the Appendix; and(iii) Checking the arithmetic accuracy of the computation of the Reconciliation as set out in the Appendix.\n\nThe procedures performed by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in this limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu does not express a reasonable assurance opinion.\n\nBased on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu has concluded that nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe that:\n\n(i) The \"Amounts as recorded under U.S. GAAP\" as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 in the Reconciliation as set out in the Appendix is not in agreement with the Interim 2024 Results prepared in accordance with the U.S. GAAP;(ii) The adjustments and reclassifications made in the Reconciliation in arriving at the \"Amounts as recorded under IFRSs\" in the Reconciliation as set out in the Appendix, do not reflect, in all material respects, the different accounting treatments according to the Group's accounting policies in accordance with the U.S. GAAP and the IFRSs of the relevant period; and(iii) The computation of the Reconciliation as set out in the Appendix is not arithmetically accurate.\n\n**Appendix**\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which differ in certain respects from IFRSs. The effects of material differences between the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group prepared under U.S. GAAP and IFRSs are as follows:\n\n**For six months ended June 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**IFRSs adjustments**  \n**Amounts asrecorded under U.S. GAAP**| **Preferred shares**| **Investments measuredat fair value**| **Share-based compensation**| **Lease**| **Redeemable equity securities**| **Amounts as recorded under IFRSs**  \n**(RMB in millions)**  \n_Note i_|  _Note ii_|  _Note iii_|  _Note iv_|  _Note v_  \nFulfillment| (32,050)| -| -| -| 845| -| (31,205)  \nMarketing| (19,068)| -| -| -| 2| -| (19,066)  \nResearch and development| (8,258)| -| -| -| 3| -| (8,255)  \nGeneral and administrative| (4,859)| -| -| -| 4| -| (4,855)  \nGain on sale of development properties| 1,481| -| -| -| (250)| -| 1,231  \n**Income from operations**|  14,697| -| -| -| 604| -| 15,301  \nShare of results of equity investees| 86| -| (391)| -| -| -| (305)  \nInterest expense| (1,244)| -| -| -| (517)| (7)| (1,768)  \nOthers, net| 4,003| -| 374| -| -| -| 4,377  \nFair value changes of preferred shares| -| (818)| -| -| -| -| (818)  \n**Income before tax**|  17,542| (818)| (17)| -| 87| (7)| 16,787  \nIncome tax expenses| (4,420)| -| (30)| (265)| -| -| (4,715)  \n**Net income**|  13,122| (818)| (47)| (265)| 87| (7)| 12,072  \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests shareholders| 280| (207)| (2)| -| (28)| -| 43  \n**Net income attributable to the Company****'****s ordinary shareholders**|  12,842| (611)| (45)| (265)| 115| (7)| 12,029  \n  \n**For six months ended June 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**IFRSs adjustments**  \n**Amounts as recorded under U.S. GAAP**| **Preferred shares**| **Investments measured at fair value**| **Share-based compensation**| **Lease**| **Redeemable equity securities**| **Impairment****of long-lived****assets**| **Convertible senior notes**| **Amounts as recorded under IFRSs**  \n**(RMB in millions)**  \n_Note i_|  _Note ii_|  _Note iii_|  _Note iv_|  _Note v_|  _Note vi_|  _Note vii_  \nCost of revenues| (465,738)| -| -| -| -| -| 17| -| (465,721)  \nFulfillment| (34,027)| -| -| -| 495| -| 7| -| (33,525)  \nMarketing| (21,121)| -| -| -| 1| -| -| -| (21,120)  \nResearch and development| (8,251)| -| -| -| 2| -| -| -| (8,249)  \nGeneral and administrative| (4,108)| -| -| -| 2| -| -| -| (4,106)  \n**Income from operations**|  18,201| -| -| -| 500| -| 24| -| 18,725  \nShare of results of equity investees| 412| -| 78| -| -| -| -| -| 490  \nInterest expense| (1,289)| -| -| -| (290)| (5)| -| (124)| (1,708)  \nOthers, net| 7,357| -| (89)| -| (84)| -| -| 1,141| 8,325  \nFair value changes of preferred shares| -| (48)| -| -| -| -| -| -| (48)  \n**Income before tax**|  24,681| (48)| (11)| -| 126| (5)| 24| 1,017| 25,784  \nIncome tax expenses| (3,722)| -| 58| (26)| -| -| -| -| (3,690)  \n**Net income**|  20,959| (48)| 47| (26)| 126| (5)| 24| 1,017| 22,094  \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests shareholders| 1,185| (11)| 38| (26)| (47)| -| 6| -| 1,145  \n**Net income attributable to the Company****'****s ordinary shareholders**|  19,774| (37)| 9| -| 173| (5)| 18| 1,017| 20,949  \n  \n**As of December 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**IFRSs adjustments**  \n**Amounts as recorded under U.S. GAAP**| **Preferred shares**| **Investments measured at fair value**| **Share-based compensation**| **Lease**| **Redeemable equity securities**| **Impairment****of long-lived****assets**| **Amounts as recorded under IFRSs**  \n**(RMB in millions)**  \n_Note i_|  _Note ii_|  _Note iii_|  _Note iv_|  _Note v_|  _Note vi_  \nProperty, equipment and software, net| 70,035| -| -| -| -| -| (950)| 69,085  \nLand use rights, net| 39,563| -| -| -| -| -| (822)| 38,741  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets| 20,863| -| -| -| (1,538)| -| -| 19,325  \nInvestment in equity investees| 56,746| -| (33,642)| -| -| -| -| 23,104  \nMarketable securities and other investments| 80,840| -| (2,765)| -| -| -| -| 78,075  \nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss| -| -| 38,125| -| -| -| -| 38,125  \nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income| -| -| 300| -| -| -| -| 300  \nDeferred tax assets| 1,744| -| 5| (696)| -| -| -| 1,053  \n**Total assets**|  628,958| -| 2,023| (696)| (1,538)| -| (1,772)| 626,975  \nAccrued expenses and other liabilities| 44,588| -| -| -| -| 560| -| 45,148  \nPreferred shares| -| 18,162| -| -| -| -| -| 18,162  \nDeferred tax liabilities| 9,267| -| 584| -| -| -| -| 9,851  \n**Total liabilities**|  332,578| 18,162| 584| -| -| 560| -| 351,884  \n**Mezzanine Equity**|  614| -| -| -| -| (614)| -| -

The preferred shares with redeemable features are classified as mezzanine equity because they are contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of certain events outside of the Group's control. This kind of preferred shares are recorded initially at fair value, net of issuance costs at the date of issuance. Accretion to the respective redemption value of the preferred shares is recognized over the period from the issuance date to the earliest redemption date.\n\nUnder IFRS, since the Group does not have an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash, the preferred shares represent liability. With certain embedded features otherwise to be bifurcated, the entire preferred shares are designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and are initially recognized at fair value, while subsequently changes in the fair value are recognized in profit or loss. The issuance costs are recorded in profit or loss.\n\n**_(ii)_****_Investments measured at fair value_** Under U.S. GAAP, the Group uses measurement alternative to record the investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes on a nonrecurring basis, and reports changes in the carrying value of the equity investments in profit or loss. Changes in the carrying value of the equity investments are required to be made whenever there are observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Those investments include convertible redeemable preferred shares, ordinary shares with preferential rights issued by privately held companies and equity investments in unlisted entities, in the form of ordinary shares without significant influence. In addition, the Group accounts for certain investments in private equity funds over which the Group does not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the existing practical expedient, and estimates fair value using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) of the investment. The Group also applies the equity method of accounting to account for certain equity investments in private equity funds.\n\nUnder IFRS, the aforementioned investments are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value, except for certain equity investments not held for trading but held for long-term strategic purposes, which are designated as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Fair value changes of these investments are recognized in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, respectively.\n\n**_(iii)_****_Share-based compensation_** Under U.S. GAAP, for awards that ordinarily give rise to a tax deduction under existing tax law, deferred taxes are computed on the basis of the compensation expense that is recognized for financial reporting purposes. In addition, tax benefits in excess of or less than the related deferred tax assets are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which the amount of the deduction is determined (typically when an award vests or, in the case of options, is exercised or expires).\n\nUnder IFRS, for awards that will give rise to a tax deduction under the applicable tax law, deferred taxes are computed on the basis of the hypothetical tax deduction for the share-based payment that corresponds to the percentage earned to date (i.e., the intrinsic value of the award on the reporting date multiplied by the percentage vested). In addition, tax benefits less than or equal to the related deferred tax assets are recognized in profit or loss, otherwise are recognized in equity.\n\n**_(iv)_****_Lease_**** _Lease classification and measurement_**\n\nUnder U.S. GAAP, the amortization of the right-of-use assets and interest expense related to the lease liabilities are recorded together as lease expense to produce a straight-line recognition effect in profit or loss.\n\nUnder IFRS, the amortization of the right-of-use assets is on a straight-line basis while the interest expense related to the lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost.\n\n**_Sale-and-leaseback arrangements_**\n\nUnder U.S. GAAP, if the sale-and-leaseback transaction qualifies as a sale, the entire gain on the transaction would be recognized.\n\nUnder IFRS, for sale-and-leaseback transactions that qualify as a sale, the gain would be limited to the amount related to the residual portion of the asset sold. The amount of the gain related to the underlying asset leased back to the lessee would be offset against the lessee's right-of-use assets.\n\n**_(v)_****_Redeemable equity securities_** Under U.S. GAAP, certain financial instruments of the Group in the form of shares with redemption features embedded are classified as redeemable non-controlling interests, when the realization of the redemption feature is subject to certain conditions that are not solely within the Group's control.\n\nUnder IFRS, these financial instruments are classified as liabilities when the Group has an obligation to repurchase the equity shares by transferring assets, irrespective of whether the obligation is unconditional or conditional.\n\n**_(vi)_****_Impairment of long-lived assets_** Under U.S. GAAP, the Group takes a two-step approach to calculate an asset or asset group impairment by comparing the asset or asset group's carrying amount with the sum of future undiscounted cash flows as a test of recoverability, and record the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value as impairment loss when the carrying amount is not recoverable.\n\nUnder IFRS, the Group takes a one-step approach to calculate an asset or cash generating unit impairment by recording the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount as an impairment loss when impairment indicators exist.\n\n**_(vii)_****_Convertible senior notes_** Under U.S. GAAP, the Notes are accounted for as debt in their entirety and are measured at amortized cost, with debt issuance cost amortized and recognized as interest expense using the effective interest method.\n\nUnder IFRSs, the Notes are hybrid instruments, each of which consists of a host debt contract and a separately accounted for derivative. The conversion feature is a derivative that may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the Group's own equity instruments, therefore does not meet the definition of equity and is a derivative liability measured at fair value through profit or loss. The embedded repurchase and redemption options of the Notes are closely related to the host debt contracts and therefore not accounted for as derivatives separately. The host debt contracts are initially measured as the difference between the fair value of the entire hybrid instruments and the fair value of the conversion feature. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the host debt contracts are accounted for at amortized cost with interest expense recognized using the effective interest method, and the changes in fair value of the conversion feature are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n__________________________\n\n1 The U.S. dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this announcement, except for those transaction amounts that were actually settled in U.S. dollars, are presented solely for the convenience of the readers.
