CorMedix?\n• CorMedix is a publicly listed (Nasdaq: CRMD), small cap early commercial stage biopharma company developing\ntherapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening conditions and diseases\n• Our lead asset DefenCath® (taurolidine and heparin) is an FDA approved, novel, first-in-class, non-antibiotic\nantimicrobial catheter lock solution (CLS) to reduce the incidence of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs)\nin the limited population of adult hemodialysis patients receiving chronic hemodialysis through a central venous\ncatheter (CVC), a critical unmet medical need with a high rate of incidence, and high rates of morbidity and mortality\nfor the hemodialysis patient population\n• DefenCath is expected to serve a sizable commercial market opportunity spanning both the hospital inpatient as well\nas outpatient dialysis segments, with inpatient reimbursement established under NTAP and outpatient reimbursement\nunder TDAPA for Medicare patients\n• Commercial launch occurred in April (inpatient) and July (outpatient) – CorMedix currently has commercial supply\nagreements in place with 4 of the top 5 outpatient dialysis providers\n• Clinical programs commencing in 2025 to support potential indication expansion (Total Parenteral Nutrition and\nPediatric HD) as well as real-world evidence study and expanded access program\n• DefenCath has 10 years of market exclusivity pursuant to FDA approval as a New Chemical Entity (NCE, 5 years) and\nQualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP, 5 years) and has the potential to receive an additional 6 months upon\ncompletion of a pediatric hemodialysis study, as well as IP protection covering the product through 2042\n3\nCorMedix Executive Leadership Team\nJOINED CORMEDIX
