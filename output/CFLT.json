(NASDAQ: CFLT)**,the data streaming pioneer, today announced financial results for its third quarter of 2024, ended September 30, 2024. \n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029049730/en/>\n\n![Q3 2024 Confluent Infographic \\(Graphic: Confluent\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20241029049730/en/2288654/4/2024-Q3-Infographic.jpg)\n\nQ3 2024 Confluent Infographic (Graphic: Confluent)\n\n“Confluent was founded with the mission of setting data in motion for organizations around the world,” said Jay Kreps, co-founder and CEO, Confluent. “Today, thousands of great customers trust Confluent to stream, connect, process, and govern their real-time data. In just 10 years since our founding, we have scaled to surpass $1 billion in total revenue run rate with over $250 million in Q3 total revenue. We also exceeded all guided metrics for Q3, including year-over-year subscription revenue growth of 27%. In the decade ahead, we remain well-positioned to drive durable long-term growth with our complete data streaming platform.” \n\n“We drove robust top-line growth, record gross margins, and another positive quarter for both non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin in the third quarter,” said Rohan Sivaram, CFO, Confluent. “Given our third quarter performance, we are raising our full-year 2024 subscription revenue guidance, and are now targeting positive non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow margin for 2024.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights** (In millions, except per share data and percentages)   \n---  \n**Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **Y/Y Change**  \nSubscription Revenue  |  $239.9 |  $189.3 |  27%   \nTotal Revenue  |  $250.2 |  $200.2 |  25%   \nGAAP Operating Loss  |  $(93.7) |  $(108.6) |  $14.9  \nNon-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)  |  $15.8 |  $(10.9) |  $26.7  \nGAAP Operating Margin  |  (37.4%)  |  (54.3%)  |  16.9 pts   \nNon-GAAP Operating Margin  |  6.3%  |  (5.5%)  |  11.8 pts   \nGAAP Net Loss Per Share  |  $(0.23) |  $(0.30) |  $0.07  \nNon-GAAP Net Income Per Diluted Share  |  $0.10 |  $0.02 |  $0.08  \nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities  |  $15.6 |  $(9.1) |  $24.7  \nFree Cash Flow  |  $9.3 |  $(13.1) |  $22.4  \nFree Cash Flow Margin  |  3.7%  |  (6.5%)  |  10.2 pts   \n  \n**Financial Outlook**\n\nFor the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, Confluent expects: \n\n**Q4 2024 Outlook** |  **FY 2024 Outlook**  \n---|---  \nSubscription Revenue  |  $245-$246 million |  $916.5-$917.5 million  \nNon-GAAP Operating Margin  |  ~2%  |  ~2%   \nNon-GAAP Net Income Per Diluted Share  |  $0.05 |  $0.25  \n  \nA reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP operating margin, free cash flow margin and non-GAAP net income per diluted share to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort, as certain items cannot be reasonably predicted because of their high variability, complexity and low visibility. In particular, the measures and effects of our stock-based compensation-related charges, which include stock-based compensation expenses, employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions, and amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized in internal-use software, are directly impacted by the timing of employee stock transactions and unpredictable fluctuations in our stock price, which we expect to have a significant impact on our future GAAP financial results. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nConfluent will host a video webcast to discuss the company’s third quarter 2024 results as well as its financial outlook today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time/1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. Open to the public, investors may access the webcast, earnings press release, supplemental financial information, and investor presentation on Confluent’s investor relations website at [investors.confluent.io](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.confluent.io&esheet=54144376&newsitemid=20241029049730&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.confluent.io&index=1&md5=fa6b0d34e4797442de857a453bd47a0a) before the commencement of the webcast.

Further information on these and other risks that could affect Confluent’s results is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and our future reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC. Additional information will be made available in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that will be filed with the SEC, which should be read in conjunction with this press release and the financial results included herein. Confluent assumes no obligation to, and does not currently intend to, update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, free cash flow, and free cash flow margin. We use these non-GAAP financial measures and other key metrics internally to facilitate analysis of our financial and business trends and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and are presented for supplemental informational purposes only. They should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In particular, other companies, including companies in our industry, may report non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, free cash flow, free cash flow margin, or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Further, free cash flow is not a substitute for cash used in operating activities. The utility of free cash flow is limited as such measure does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for any given period. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as presented below. We define non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative), non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as the respective GAAP measures, adjusted for, as applicable, stock-based compensation-related charges which include stock-based compensation expense, employer taxes on employee stock transactions and amortization of stock-based compensation capitalized in internal-use software; amortization of acquired intangibles; acquisition-related expenses; restructuring and other related charges; amortization of debt issuance costs; and income tax effects associated with these adjustments as well as the non-recurring income tax expense or benefit associated with acquisitions. Non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin are defined as non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operating income (loss) as a percentage of revenue, respectively. We define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less capitalized internal-use software costs and capital expenditures and free cash flow margin as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. We believe that free cash flow and free cash flow margin are useful indicators of liquidity that provide information to management and investors about the performance of core operations and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business. \n\n**Definition**\n\n_Customers with $100,000 or greater in annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) _represent the number of customers that contributed $100,000 or more in ARR as of period end. We define ARR as (1) with respect to Confluent Platform customers, the amount of revenue to which our customers are contractually committed over the following 12 months assuming no increases or reductions in their subscriptions, and (2) with respect to Confluent Cloud customers, the amount of revenue that we expect to recognize from such customers over the following 12 months, calculated by annualizing actual consumption of Confluent Cloud in the last three months of the applicable period, assuming no increases or reductions in usage rate. Services arrangements are excluded from the calculation of ARR. For purposes of determining our customer count, we treat all affiliated entities with the same parent organization as a single customer and include pay-as-you-go customers. Our customer count is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. \n\n**About Confluent**\n\nConfluent is the data streaming platform that is pioneering a fundamentally new category of data infrastructure that sets data in motion.
