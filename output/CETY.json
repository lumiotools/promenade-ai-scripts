In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this report.\n\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following:\n\n● | our possible or assumed future results of operations;  \n---|---  \n● | our business strategies;  \n● | our ability to attract and retain customers;  \n● | our ability to sell additional products and services to customers;  \n● | our cash needs and financing plans;  \n● | our competitive position;  \n● | our industry environment;  \n● | our potential growth opportunities;  \n● | expected technological advances by us or by third parties and our ability to leverage them;  \n● | Our inability to predict or anticipate the duration or long-term economic and business consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;  \n● | the effects of future regulation;  \n● | our ability to protect or monetize our intellectual property;  \n● | changes in United States and China trade policies and relations, as well as relations with other countries, and/or changes in regulations and/or sanctions;  \n● | the impact on us from the actions the Chinese government may take to intervene in or influence our operations;  \n● | the impact on us from the uncertainties in the Chinese legal system, such as Chinese regulations regarding acquisitions of companies based in mainland China by foreign investors and the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to make payments to us; and  \n● | approval, filing, or procedural requirements imposed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) or other Chinese regulatory authorities in connection with issuing securities to foreign investors under Chinese law.  \n  \n3  \n---  \n  \nYou should read any other cautionary statements made in this report as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this report will prove to be accurate and therefore prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. You should read this report completely. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Disclosures Relating to Our Chinese Operations**\n\nClean Energy Technologies Inc. is a company incorporated in the State of Nevada with operations in North America, Europe, and Asia, including in China. Our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya, an entity in which we own a 49% equity interest, operate our natural gas trading operations in China to source and supply natural gas to industries and municipalities located in China. Throughout this report, unless the context requires otherwise, (i) “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. on a consolidated basis with its wholly-owned subsidiaries; (ii) “the PRC Subsidiaries” refers specifically to those wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours located in the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong), which include Clean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited, Meishan Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., Hainan Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., Element Capital International Limited (H.K.), Sichuan Hunya Jieneng New Energy Co. LTD, and Jiangsu Huanya Jieneng New Energy Co., Ltd.; and (iii) “Shuya” refers to Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited.\n\nWe face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties due to our operations in China. Our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya could be adversely affected by uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system. Rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice. The interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations involve additional uncertainties. Since administrative and court authorities in China have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. In addition, the Chinese government exercises significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of the business of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya and may intervene in or influence their operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals, which could result in a material change in their operations in China and/or the value of the securities we are registering for sale, including causing the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Furthermore, the Chinese government has recently exerted more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies. Any such actions, once taken by the Chinese government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\n\nRecently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. We do not believe that we, our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya are directly subject to these regulatory actions or statements; however, because these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative rule making bodies in China will respond to them, or what existing or new laws or regulations will be modified or promulgated, if any, or the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on the daily business operations or ability to accept foreign investments of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya. On December 24, 2021, nine government agencies jointly issued the Opinions on Promoting the Healthy and Sustainable Development of Platform Economy, which provides that, among others, monopolistic agreements, abuse of dominant market position and illegal concentration of business operators in the field of platform economy will be strictly investigated and punished in accordance with the relevant laws. Neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya hold a dominant market position in their product markets and they have not entered into any monopolistic agreement. Neither have they received any inquiry from the relevant governmental authorities. The Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”), together with 12 other Chinese regulatory authorities, released the final version of the Revised Measures for Cybersecurity Review, or the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, in December 2021, which took effect on February 15, 2022. Pursuant to the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, critical information infrastructure operators procuring network products and services and online platform operators carrying out data processing activities, which affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review pursuant to the provisions therein. In addition, online platform operators possessing personal information of more than one million users seeking to be listed on foreign stock markets must apply for a cybersecurity review. On November 14, 2021, the CAC published the Draft Regulations on the Network Data Security Administration (Draft for Comments) (the “Security Administration Draft”), which provides that data processing operators engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect national security must be subject to cybersecurity review by the relevant Cyberspace Administration of the PRC. We do not believe that our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya are “online platform operators” within the meaning of the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, and neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya currently possess over one million Chinese users’ personal information and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million Chinese users’ personal information in the foreseeable future. In addition, neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya will be subject to Security Administration Draft if the Security Administration Draft is enacted as proposed, since they currently do not collect data that affects or may affect national security and we do not anticipate that our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya will be collecting data that affects or may affect national security in the foreseeable future.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \nOn February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, and the relevant five guidelines, which became effective on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures comprehensively reformed the existing regulatory regime for overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities and will regulate both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities by adopting a filing-based regulatory regime. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, PRC domestic companies that seek to offer and list securities in overseas markets, either in direct or indirect means, are required to fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC and report relevant information. The Trial Measures provides that if the issuer meets both of the following criteria, the overseas securities offering and listing conducted by such issuer will be deemed as indirect overseas offering by PRC domestic companies: (i) 50% or more of any of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year is accounted for by domestic companies; and (ii) the principal parts of the issuer’s business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its principal place(s) of business are located in mainland China, or the majority of senior management staff in charge of its business operations and management are PRC citizens or have their usual place(s) of residence located in mainland China. If we ever are required by the CSRC to submit and complete the filing procedures for our future offerings of our securities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete such filings in a timely manner, or even at all, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Any failure by us to comply with such filing requirements under the Trial Measures may result in rectification, warnings, and a fine between RMB 1 million and RMB 10 million on our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya, which could adversely and materially affect our business operations and financial outlook and could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or, in extreme cases, become worthless.\n\nAs of the date of this report, these new laws and guidelines have not impacted the ability of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya to conduct business and accept foreign investments; however, if (i) we inadvertently conclude that permissions or approvals are not required from applicable PRC authorities or (ii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change, and we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, our ability to conduct our business in China may be materially impacted, the interest of the investors may be materially and adversely affected and our common stock may significantly decrease in value.\n\nIn addition, we face risks associated with the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA. Trading in our securities on U.S. markets, including Nasdaq, may be prohibited under the HFCAA if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, determines that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor for two consecutive years. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong because of positions taken by the authorities in those jurisdictions. In addition, the PCAOB’s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol Agreement with the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance (the “MOF”) of the PRC governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China or Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced in the 2022 Determination its determination that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, and the PCAOB Board voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary. Should the PCAOB again encounter impediments to inspections and investigations in mainland China or Hong Kong as a result of positions taken by any authority in either jurisdiction, including by the CSRC or the MOF, the PCAOB will make determinations under the HFCAA as and when appropriate. Both our current auditor, TAAD LLP, and our former auditor, Fruci & Associates II, PLLC, are headquartered in the United States and, as PCAOB-registered public accounting firms, they are required to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the U.S. and professional standards. TAAD LLP and Fruci & Associates II, PLLC have been subject to PCAOB inspections and are not among the PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC or Hong Kong that are subject to PCAOB’s determination of having been unable to inspect or investigate completely. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, if there is any regulatory change or step taken by PRC regulators that does not permit our auditor to provide audit documentations located in China or Hong Kong to the PCAOB for inspection or investigation, or the PCAOB expands the scope of the Determination so that we are subject to the HFCAA, as the same may be amended, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected or investigated by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors’ audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate, which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets, and trading of our securities, including trading on the national exchange and trading on “over-the-counter” markets, may be prohibited under the HFCAA and our securities may be delisted by an exchange.\n\nCash may be transferred within our organization in the following manners: (i) Clean Energy Technologies Inc. may transfer funds to the PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya by way of capital contributions or loans, through intermediate holding subsidiaries or otherwise, as investments or lendings, (ii) the PRC Subsidiaries may make dividends or other distributions to Clean Energy Technologies Inc. through intermediate holding companies or otherwise, and (iii) Shuya may make dividends or other distributions to Clean Energy Technologies Inc., which indirectly owns a 49% equity interest in Shuya, through intermediate holding companies or otherwise. Our abilities to use cash held in PRC or in a PRC entity to fund operations or for other purposes outside of the PRC are subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by the PRC government. Current PRC regulations only permit a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or WFOE, to pay dividends to its offshore parent company out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the majority of the revenues of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya are collected in RMB. Thus, foreign exchange shortages and foreign exchange control may also limit their ability to pay dividends or make other payments or otherwise meet our obligations denominated in foreign currencies. Furthermore, we may lose our ability to fund operations or for other uses outside of Hong Kong using cash in Hong Kong or a Hong Kong entity if, in the future, the scope of the current restrictions and limitations applicable to PRC entities were to expand to include Hong Kong or entities based in Hong Kong. Therefore, our ability to transfer cash between PRC entities and entities outside of PRC may be restricted. As of the date of this report, (i) we have transferred $2,671,700 in total to our PRC Subsidiaries, and (ii) JHJ, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the PRC, has transferred $701,836 in total to Shuya as a capital contribution for the formation of Shuya. No other cash flows or transfers of other assets have occurred between us, our PRC Subsidiaries, and Shuya . As of the date of this report, neither any of our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya has declared any dividends or made any other distributions to the Company, and no such dividends or distributions are anticipated in the near future. \n\n5  \n---  \n  \n**PART I – FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.

All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\n\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year end December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have access to, the audited financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nThe summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.\n\n**Corporate History**\n\nWe were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc. We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We manufactured electronics and provided services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products. On September 11, 2015 Clean Energy HRS, or “CE HRS”, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International. In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1340 Reynolds Avenue, Irvine, CA 92614. Our telephone number is (949) 273-4990. Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CETY.”\n\nOur internet website address is www.cetyinc.com. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this document, and you should not consider any information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website as part of this document.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy Heat Recovery Solutions (HRS) & CETY Europe, CETY Renewables waste to energy, engineering & manufacturing services, and CETY HK NG trading.\n\n**Going Concern**\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder’s equity of $3,583,444 and a working capital deficit of $778,464 as of September 30, 2024. The company also had an accumulated deficit of $26,643,673 as of September 30, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**Plan of Operation**\n\nCETY is a rising leader in the zero-emission revolution by providing eco-friendly energy solutions, clean energy fuels, and alternative electric power for small to mid-sized projects across North America, Europe, and Asia. The company harnesses the power of heat and biomass to produce electricity with zero emissions and minimal cost. Additionally, the company offers Waste to Energy Solutions, converting waste materials from manufacturing, agriculture, and wastewater treatment plants into electricity and BioChar. Clean Energy Technologies also provides Engineering, Consulting, and Project Management Solutions, leveraging its expertise to develop clean energy projects for both municipal and industrial customers, as well as Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) companies.\n\n**Our Principal Businesses**\n\n**Heat Recovery Solutions** – Clean Energy Technologies patented Clean Cycle Generator (CCG) is a heat recovery system that captures waste heat from various sources and converts it into electricity. This system can be integrated into various industrial processes, helping to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions.\n\n**Waste to Energy Solutions** - Clean Energy Technologies’ waste to energy solutions involve converting organic waste materials, such as agricultural waste and food waste, into clean energy through its proprietary gasification technology that produce a range of products, including electricity, heat, and biochar.\n\n**Engineering, Consulting and Project Management Solutions** – Clean Energy Technologies offers engineering and manufacturing services to help clients bring their sustainable energy products to market. This includes design, prototyping, testing, and production services. Clean Energy Technologies’ expertise in engineering and manufacturing enables it to provide customized solutions to meet clients’ specific needs.\n\n**Clean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited (“CETY HK”)** – our natural gas (“NG”) trading operations source and supply NG to industries and municipalities in mainland China. NG is principally used for heavy truck refueling stations and urban or industrial users. We purchase large quantities of NG from large wholesale NG depots at fixed prices which are prepaid for in advance at a discount to the market. We sell the NG to our customers at fixed prices or prevailing daily spot prices for the duration of the contracts.\n\n**NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\nThe summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (formerly Probe Manufacturing, Inc.) is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates may be materially different from actual financial results. Significant estimates include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the collection of accounts receivable and valuation of inventory and reserves.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nWe maintain the majority of our cash accounts at JP Morgan Chase bank. The total cash balance is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000, (which we may exceed from time to time) per commercial bank. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows we consider all cash and highly liquid investments with initial maturities of one year or less to be cash equivalents.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**Accounts Receivable**\n\nOur ability to collect receivables is affected by economic fluctuations in the geographic areas and industries served by us. Reserves for un-collectable amounts are provided, based on past experience and a specific analysis of the accounts. Although we expect to collect amounts due, actual collections may differ from the estimated amounts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable accounts receivable of $95,322 and $95,322, respectively. Our policy for reserves for our long-term financing receivables is determined on a contract-by-contract basis and considers the length of the financing arrangement. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable long-term financing receivables of $247,500 and $247,500, respectively.\n\n5 customers accounted for 100% of accounts receivable on September 30, 2024. Our trade accounts primarily represent unsecured receivables. Historically, our bad debt write-offs related to these trade accounts have been insignificant.\n\n**Inventory**\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or net realizable value. Our industry experiences changes in technology, changes in market value and availability of raw materials, as well as changing customer demand. We make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventories based on regular audits and cycle counts of our on-hand inventory levels and forecasted customer demands and at times additional provisions are made. Any inventory write offs are charged to the reserve account. As of September 30, 2024 we had a reserve of $934,344 as compared to a reserve of $934,344 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Property and Equipment**\n\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Assets held under capital leases are recorded at lease inception at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets. The cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES\n\nFurniture and fixtures | 3 to 5 years  \n---|---  \n  \n**Goodwill**\n\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, _Intangibles—Goodwill and Other_. Under ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of underlying identifiable net assets of business acquired.\n\nThe Company tests goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events arise or circumstances change that indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company assesses whether goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed, as required by ASC 350, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists.\n\nThe quantitative test is used to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The determination of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units is based, among other things, on estimates of the future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued. A goodwill impairment test is required to be completed, at minimum, once annually, and any resulting impairment loss recorded upon completion of the assessment. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \nWhen performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company’s methodology includes the use of an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the Company’s cost of capital, otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method (“DCF”). These estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses. Factors affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products and services offered by the businesses, the development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development, the future cost structure of the businesses, and future technological changes. The Company also incorporates market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified.\n\n**Intangible Assets**\n\nThe Company’s intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangibles, licenses and patents. Upon acquisition, estimates are made in valuing acquired intangible assets, which include but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, and estimating cash flows from projects when completed; tradename and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time that customer relationships will continue; and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from the assumptions used in determining the fair values. All intangible assets are capitalized at their original cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\n**Long-Lived Assets**\n\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nRecoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, _“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”_ (“ASC 606”).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10_\n\n15  \n---  \n  \nAn entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\na. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).\n\nb. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).\n\nc. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-30_\n\nIf a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\n\nb. The customer has legal title to the asset\n\nc. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\n\nd. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\n\ne. The customer has accepted the asset\n\nThe core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition, a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \nThe following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:\n\n● | We generate a quotation  \n---|---  \n● | We receive Purchase orders from our customers.  \n● | We build the product to their specification  \n● | We invoice at the time of shipment  \n● | The terms are typically Net 30 days  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \nThe following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:\n\n● | CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service.   \n---|---  \n  \n_A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):_\n\na. | A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer to the customer may not qualify.  \n---|---  \nb. | A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.  \nc. | A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer.  \n  \nIf the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.\n\nAdditionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:\n\nBecause the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.\n\nIn recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.\n\n● | The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY and customer agree to a total EPC contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.  \n---|---  \n  \nSecondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with its agreement with clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.\n\nCETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.\n\nCETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There is no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \nIn review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.\n\nIn reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.\n\nFinally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.\n\nFor CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nDuring the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.\n\nWe have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.\n\nAlso, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $33,000 and $33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of year 2024.\n\nAlso from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding customer deposits of $53,026 and $165,236 respectively.\n\n**Fair Value of Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 820-10 (SFAS No. 157), “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:\n\n● | Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  \n---|---  \n● | Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.  \n● | Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s derivative liabilities have been valued as Level 3 instruments. We value the derivative liability using a lattice model, with a volatility of 56% and using a risk free interest rate of 0.15%  \n  \n18  \n---  \n  \nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and convertible notes payable. The estimated fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses and convertible notes payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n**Foreign Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)**\n\nWe have no material components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods. The accounts of the Company’s Chinese entities are maintained in RMB. The accounts of the Chinese entities were translated into USD in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters.” All assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; stockholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income.” Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the statements of operations.\n\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 220-10, “Comprehensive Income (loss).” Comprehensive income (loss) comprises net income (loss) and all changes to the statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in additional paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders.\n\n**Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation**\n\nIn July 2022, JHJ and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHK owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022, JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya.\n\nShuya was set up as the operating entity for pipeline natural gas (PNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) trading business, while the other two shareholders of Shuaya have large supply relationships.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that Shuya was not a VIE and has evaluated its consolidation analysis under the voting interest model. Because the Company does not own greater than 50% of the outstanding voting shares, either directly or indirectly, it has accounted for its investment in Shuya under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investor (“JHJ”) recognizes its share of the profits and losses of the investee (“Shuya”) in the periods when these profits and losses are also reflected in the accounts of the investee. Any profit or loss recognized by the investing entity appears in its income statement. Also, any recognized profit increases the investment recorded by the investing entity, while a recognized loss decreases the investment.\n\nJHJ made a investment of RMB 3.91 million ($0.55 million) into Shuya during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 recorded in accordance with ASC 323. Shuya had a net loss of approximately $10,750 during the year ending December 31, 2022, of which approximately $5,000 was allocated to the company, reducing the investment by that amount.\n\nHowever, effective January 1, 2023, JHJ, SSET and Chengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (“Xiangyueheng), who is the 10% shareholder of Shuya, entered a Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, wherein these three shareholders (or three parties) will guarantee that the voting rights will be expressed in the same way at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agree that within the validity period of this agreement, before the party intends to propose the motions to the shareholders or the board of directors on the major matters related to the voting rights of the shareholders or the board of directors, the three parties internally will discuss, negotiate and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of Consistent Action Agreement, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (“VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nThe change of control interest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, referred to as ASC, 805, Business Combinations. The management determined that the Company was the acquiror for financial accounting purposes. In identifying the Company as the accounting acquiror, the companies considered the structure of the transaction and other actions contemplated by the Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, relative outstanding share ownership and market values, the composition of the combined company’s board of directors, the relative size of Shuya, and the designation of certain senior management positions of the combined company.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 805, the Company recorded the acquisition based on the fair value of the consideration transferred and then allocated the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of the value of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair value of those net assets was recorded as goodwill. Any identified definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives and any identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The valuation of purchase considerations was based on preliminary estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAs the Consistent Action Agreement did not quantify any considerations to gain the control, the deemed consideration paid is the fair value of 51% non-controlling interest as of January 1, 2023. The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on January 1, 2023, the acquisition date.\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED\n\nFair value of non-controlling interests | $| 650,951  \n---|---|---  \nFair value of previously held equity investment | 556,096  \nSubtotal | $| 1,207,047  \nRecognized value of 100% of identifiable net assets | (1,207,047| )  \nGoodwill Recognized | $| -  \nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (preliminary):  \nInventories | $| 516,131  \nCash and cash equivalents | 50,346  \nTrade and other receivables | 952,384  \nAdvanced deposit | 672,597  \nNet fixed assets | 6,704  \nTrade and other payables | (1,021,897| )  \nAdvanced payments | (5,317| )  \nSalaries and wages payables | (4,692| )  \nOther receivable | 40,791  \nTotal identifiable net assets | $| 1,207,047  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \nUnder ASC-805-10-50-2, initial consolidation of an investee previously reported using fair value or the equity method should be accounted for prospectively as of the date the entity obtained a controlling financial interest. Therefore, the Company should provide pro forma information as if the consolidation had occurred as of the beginning of each of the current and prior comparative reporting period per\n\nOn January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n**Net (Loss) per Common Share**\n\nBasic (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding common shares of 44,591,381. Basic and diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 42,613,090 and 38,227,965, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had convertible notes convertible into approximately 2,536,750 of additional common shares and additional 5,125,331 common shares underlying our outstanding warrants. Fully diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents were withheld from the calculation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as they were considered anti-dilutive.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nWe had no amounts of research and development (R&D) expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Segment Disclosure**\n\nFASB Codification Topic 280, _Segment Reporting_ , establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about an enterprise’s reportable segments. The Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy Heat Recovery Solutions (HRS) & CETY Europe, CETY renewables waste to energy, engineering & manufacturing services, and CETY HK NG trading. The segments are determined based on several factors, including the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, customer base, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics. Refer to note 1 for a description of the various product categories manufactured under each of these segments.\n\nAn operating segment’s performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net sales less cost of sales, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, other charges (income), net and interest and other, net.\n\n**Selected Financial Data** :\n\nSCHEDULE OF FINANCIAL DATA\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nFor the nine months ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nNet Sales  \nManufacturing and Engineering | $ | 9,341 | $ | 59,877  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 158,830 | 399,136  \nNG Trading | 1,185,178 | 4,039,470  \nWaste to Energy | 590,985 | 779,720  \nDiscontinued operations | - | 6,422,915  \nTotal Sales | $ | 1,944,334 | $ | 11,701,118  \nSegment income and reconciliation before tax  \nManufacturing and Engineering | - | 16,528  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 96,960 | 148,706  \nLNG Trading | (12,575 | ) | 89,466  \nWaste to Energy | 549,946 | 738,243  \nTotal Segment income | 634,331 | 992,943  \nLess: operating expense | 3,193,447 | 2,463,090  \nLess: other income and expenses | 998,797 | 1,171,511  \nNet (loss) before income tax | $ | (3,557,913 | ) | $ | (2,641,658 | )  \n  \n21  \n---  \n  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nTotal Assets  \nManufacturing and Engineering | $ | - | $ | 2,544,786  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 3,237,319 | 3,099,223  \nWaste to Energy | 1,063,067 | 486,572  \nLNG Trading | 2,681,271 | 4,798,030  \nTotal Assets | $ | 6,981,657 | $ | 10,928,611  \n  \nThe following table represents revenue by geographic area based on the sales location of our products and solutions:\n\nSCHEDULE OF REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS BASED ON SALES LOCATION OF OUR PRODUCTS\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nFor the nine months ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nUnited States | 752,069 | 1,207,760  \nChina include discontinued operation: $6,422,915 | 1,185,178 | 10,462,385  \nOther international | 7,087 | 30,973  \nTotal Sales | 1,944,334 | 11,701,118  \n  \n**Share-Based Compensation**\n\nThe Company has adopted the use of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) (now contained in FASB Codification Topic 718, _Compensation-Stock Compensation_), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and its related implementation guidance and eliminates the alternative to use Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement 123 as originally issued. This Statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instruments, which includes grants of stock options and stock warrants, based on the fair value of the award, measured at the grant date (with limited exceptions). Under this standard, the fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date, using an option-pricing model that meets certain requirements. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards, including stock options and warrants. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of SFAS No. 123R; however, the fair values generated may not reflect their actual fair values, as it does not consider certain factors, such as vesting requirements, employee attrition and transferability limitations. The Black-Scholes model valuation is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected volatility and estimated life of our stock options at grant date based on historical volatility. For the “risk-free interest rate,” we use the Constant Maturity Treasury rate on 90-day government securities. The term is equal to the time until the option expires. The dividend yield is not applicable, as the Company has not paid any dividends, nor do we anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. The fair value of our restricted stock is based on the market value of our free trading common stock, on the grant date calculated using a 20-trading-day average. At the time of grant, the share-based compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest using historical employee attrition rates and the expense is reduced accordingly. It is also adjusted to account for the restricted and thinly traded nature of the shares. The expense is reviewed and adjusted in subsequent periods if actual attrition differs from those estimates.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nWe re-evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on a quarterly basis and, if changes warrant different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount expensed in the past. We may be required to adjust any remaining share-based compensation expense, based on any additions, cancellations or adjustments to the share-based awards. The expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 we had $62,250 and $148,100 in share-based expense, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 we had no further non-vested expense to be recognized.\n\n**Leases**\n\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, or ASC 842, using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment to be accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019, and accordingly, modified its policy on accounting for leases as stated below. As described under “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements,” below, the primary impact of adopting ASC 842 for the Company was the recognition in the consolidated balance sheet of certain lease-related assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms longer than 12 months.\n\nThe Company’s leases primarily consist of facility leases which are classified as operating leases. The Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company recognizes a lease liability to make contractual payments under all leases with terms greater than twelve months and a corresponding right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term using the collateralized incremental borrowing rate since the implicit rate is unknown. Options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such an option. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the contractual lease liability plus any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made, less any lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLeased right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing as a long-lived asset at the asset-group level. The Company monitors its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. As the Company’s leased right-of-use assets primarily relate to facility leases, early abandonment of all or part of facility as part of a restructuring plan is typically an indicator of impairment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company tests whether the carrying amount of the leased right-of-use asset is recoverable including consideration of sublease income, and if not recoverable, measures impairment loss for the right-of-use asset or asset group.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nFederal Income taxes are not currently due since we have had losses since inception of Clean Energy Technologies.\n\nOn December 22, 2018 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (“Federal Tax Rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company will compute its income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 using a Federal Tax Rate of 21% and an estimated state of California rate of 9%.\n\nIncome taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 _Income Taxes – Recognition._ Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than not” standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nDeferred income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $(15,737,415) and a deferred tax asset of $4,727,224 using the statutory rate of 30%. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked a valuation allowance of $(2,482,763). FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. On September 30, 2024 the Company did not take any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740.\n\nOn February 13, 2018, Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Registrant” or “Corporation”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (“Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and between MGW Investment I Limited (“MGWI”) and the Corporation. The Corporation received $907,388 in exchange for the issuance of 302,462,667 restricted shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Common Stock”).\n\nOn February 13, 2018, the Corporation and Confections Ventures Limited. (“CVL”) entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Convertible Note Purchase Agreement,” together with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder, the “Financing”) pursuant to which the Corporation issued to CVL a convertible promissory Note (the “CVL Note”) in the principal amount of $939,500 with an interest rate of 10% per annum interest rate and a maturity date of February 13, 2020. The CVL Note is convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.12 per share, as adjusted as provided therein. This note was assigned to MGW Investments.\n\nThis resulted in a change in control, which limited the net operating to that date forward. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and the states of California. Further, the Company currently has no open tax years’ subject to audit prior to December 31, 2015. The Company is current on its federal and state tax returns.\n\n**Reclassification**\n\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported income, total assets, or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**\n\n**Deferred Stock Issuance Costs**\n\nDeferred stock issuance costs represent amounts paid for legal, consulting, and other offering expenses in conjunction with the future raising of additional capital to be performed within one year. These costs are netted against additional paid-in capital as a cost of the stock issuance upon closing of the respective stock placement.\n\n**NOTE 3 – ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE**\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts Receivable | $ | 1,064,059 | 1,197,386  \nAccounts Receivable Related Party | 1,082,759 | 491,774  \nLess reserve for uncollectable accounts | (95,322 | ) | (95,000 | )  \nTotal | $ | 2,051,496 | 1,594,160  \n  \n24  \n---  \n  \nOur Accounts Receivable is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\nSCHEDULE OF LEASE RECEIVABLE ASSET\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nLong-term financing receivables | $| 1,249,854 | $| 1,149,854  \nLess Reserve for uncollectable accounts | (247,500| ) | (247,500| )  \nLong-term financing receivables - net | $| 1,002,354 | $| 902,354  \n  \nThe Company is currently modifying the assets subject to lease to meet the provisions of the agreement, and as of September 30, 2024 any collection on the lease payments was not yet considered probable, resulting in no derecognition of the underlying asset and no net lease investments recognized on the sales-type lease pursuant to ASC 842-30-25-3.\n\nOn a contract-by-contract basis or projects that require extensive work from multiple contractors or supply chain challenges or in response to certain situations or installation difficulties, the Company may elect to allow non-interest bearing repayments in excess of 1 year.\n\nOur long-term financing receivable are pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 4 – INVENTORIES, NET**\n\nInventories by major classification were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INVENTORIES\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nInventory | $ | 1,702,798 | 1,600,757  \nLess reserve for uncollectable accounts | (934,344 | ) | (934,344 | )  \nTotal | $ | 768,454 | 666,413  \n  \nOur Inventory is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 5 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nProperty and equipment were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nProperty and Equipment | $ | 1,434,923 | 1,430,076  \nAccumulated Depreciation | (1,431,504 | ) | (1,425,546 | )  \nNet Fixed Assets | $ | 3,419 | 4,530  \n  \nOur depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $5,958 and $13,805 (include depreciation expense of $3,342 from discontinued operation) respectively.\n\nOur property and equipment is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\nIntangible assets were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nGoodwill | $ | 747,976 | 747,976  \nLWL Intangibles | 1,468,709 | 1,468,709  \nInvestment - Shuya | 597,564 | 12,914  \nLicense | 354,322 | 354,322  \nPatents | 190,789 | 190,789  \nAccumulated Amortization | (107,878 | ) | (98,972 | )  \nNet Intangible Assets | $ | 3,251,482 | 2,675,738  \n  \nOur Amortization Expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $8,906 and $13,805 (include amortization expense of $3,342 from discontinued operation) respectively.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nBased on the foregoing analysis of the facts surrounding the Company’s acquisition of LWL, it is the Company’s position that the Company is the acquirer of LWL, under the acquisition method of accounting.\n\nAs such, as of November 8, 2021 (the acquisition date), the Company recognized, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the business combination.\n\nThe following table presents the purchase price allocation:\n\nSCHEDULE OF BUSINESS ACQUISITION PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION\n\n**Consideration:**  \n---  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 1,500,000  \nTotal purchaser consideration | $ | 1,500,000  \n**Assets acquired:**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 6,156  \nPrepayment | 22,035  \nOther receivable | 20,000  \nTrading Contracts | 146,035  \nShenzhen Gas Relationship | 1,314,313  \n**Total assets acquired** | 1,508,539  \n**Liabilities assumed:**  \nAdvance Receipts | $ | (8,539 | )  \n**Net Assets Acquired:** | $ | 1,500,000  \n  \nIf LWL reaches USD 5 million in revenue or net profit of USD 1 million by December 31, 2023, then based on the performance contingency there would be an issuance of 500,000 shares of CETY to the Seller.

Amounts outstanding under the agreement bear interest at the rate of 2.0% per the initial 30 days followed by 1% each 15 day increment thereafter (24% annually). It is secured by the assets of the Company. In addition, it is personally guaranteed by Kambiz Mahdi, our Chief Executive Officer. As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance was $653,536 compared to $626,033 at December 31, 2023.\n\nOn April 1, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the purchase order financing agreement with DHN Capital, LLC dba Nations Interbanc. Nations Interbanc has lowered the accrued fees balance by $275,000 as well as the accrual rate to 2.25% per 30 days. As a result, CETY has agreed to remit a minimum monthly payment of $25,000 by the final calendar day of each month.\n\nOn March 30, 2023 amendment to the purchase order financing agreement with DHN Capital, LLC dba Nations Interbanc in which Nations Interbanc lowered the accrual rate to 1.25% per 30 days (15% annually). We are currently in default of this note.\n\nOn September 11, 2015, our CE HRS subsidiary issued a promissory note in the initial principal amount $1,400,000 and assumed a pension liability of $100,000, for a total liability of $1,500,000, in connection with our acquisition of the heat recovery solutions, or HRS, assets of General Electric International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“GEII”), including intellectual property, patents, trademarks, machinery, equipment, tooling and fixtures. The note bears interest at the rate of 2.66% per annum. The note is payable on the following schedule: (a) $200,000 in principal on December 31, 2015 and (b) thereafter, the remaining principal amount of $1,200,000, together with interest thereon, payable in equal quarterly instalments of principal and interest of $157,609, commencing on December 31, 2016 and continuing until December 31, 2019, at which time the remaining unpaid principal amount of this note and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable in full. CETY stopped making payments and informed GE that it had encountered difficulties because of the valuations of the assets that were acquired from GE. Given that the values of the assets were different than GE’s internal reports and as we discussed at the time of the transaction with GE’s management, we proposed a change in the amount the Company owes GE under the purchase agreement, but GE was non-responsive, and GE’s entire distributed power vertical has been divested.\n\nBased on the California Statute of Limitations, the Nevada Statute of Limitations, and the New York Statute of Limitations it is the view of our legal counsel that the above referenced debt is no longer an enforceable obligation. under California law, Nevada law, and New York law, as it became past due no later than November 3, 2016, more than Six (6) years ago and last payment made on the debt was on November 3, 2016, which is more than Six (6) years ago.

For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but has been updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted the above ASU as of January 1, 2019. The right of use asset and lease liability have been recorded at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, utilizing a 5% average borrowing rate and the company is utilizing the transition relief and “running off” on current leases.\n\nAs of May 1, 2017, our corporate headquarters were located at 2990 Redhill Unit A, Costa Mesa, CA.

In addition, the company established CETY Renewables Ashfield LLC (“CRA”) a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashfield Renewables Ag Development LLC(“ARA”) with our partner, Ashfield AG (“AG”). The purpose of the joint venture was the development of a pyrolysis plant established to convert woody feedstock into electricity and BioChar by using high temperature ablative fast pyrolysis reactor for which Clean Energy Technology, Inc. holds the license for. The CRA was located in Ashfield, Massachusetts. Based upon the terms of the members’ agreement, the CETY Capital LLC owned 75% interest and AG owns a 25% interest in Ashfield Renewables Ag Development LLC. The agreement with CETY Renewables Ashfield has been terminated and CETY Renewable Ashfield was dissolved.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have deconsolidated the CRA business unit. The Liabilities of CRA has been transferred to Vermont Renewable Gas LLC (“VRG”), a newly formed entity. CETY retains 49% equity in VRG.\n\nOn April 2, 2023 the Company formed CETY Capital LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of CETY. In addition, the company established Vermont Renewable Gas LLC (“VRG”) with our partner, Synergy Bioproducts Corporation (“SBC”) The purpose of the joint venture is the development of a pyrolysis plant established to convert wood feedstock into electricity and BioChar by using high temperature ablative fast pyrolysis reactor for which Clean Energy Technology, Inc. holds the license for. The VRG is in Lyndon, Vermont. Based upon the terms of the members’ agreement, CETY Capital LLC owns a 49% interest and SBC owns a 51% interest in Vermont Renewable Gas LLC.\n\nThe Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 49/51 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of 3 members. Two of the three members are from Synergy Bioproducts Corporation, and one is from CETY. Both parties do not have substantial capital at risk and CETY does not have voting interest. However, SBC has controlling interest and more board votes therefore SBC is the beneficiary of the VIE and as a result we record it as an equity investment. Accordingly, the Company has elected to account for the joint venture as an equity method investment in accordance with ASC 323 Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This decision is a result of the company’s evaluation of its involvement with potential variable interest entities and their respective risk and reward scenarios, which collectively affirm that the conditions necessitating the application of the variable interest model are not present.\n\nIn July 2022 JHJ and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHJ owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022 JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya. As a result of Consistent Action Agreement entered on December 31, 2022 the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (“VIE”) of JHJ, and the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023. The non-controlling interest of Shuya represents the 41% equity ownership that is owned by Leishen, and 10% equity ownership owned by another shareholder.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \nOn January 1, 2024 and effective on the same date., JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties release each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company has determined that Shuya no longer constitutes a VIE and the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n**NOTE 15 – DECONSOLIDATION OF SUBSIDIARY**\n\nOn January 1, 2024 and effective on the same date., JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties release each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company has determined that Shuya no longer constitutes a VIE and the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024. Accordingly, started from January 1, 2024, the Company deconsolidated Shuya. Under ASC 810-10-40-5, deconsolidation of a VIE generally results in recognition of a gain or loss in the income statement. In addition, any retained equity interest or investment in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value as of the date of deconsolidation. The consideration for deconsolidating of Shuya is $0, the Company used discounted cash flow method to evaluate the fair value of Shuya, and determined the fair value of retained equity interest for Shuya and NCI approximate its carry value; therefore, no gain or loss was recognized from deconsolidation of Shuya.\n\nThe Company recalculated the fair value of Shuya as of January 1, 2024 using the income approach at $543,788 and recorded a loss of $27,139 from deconsolidation of Shuya for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of Shuya at December 31, 2023.\n\nSCHEDULE OF CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nCash | $| 85,226  \n---|---|---  \nAccounts receivable | 164,744  \nAdvance to supplier-prepayment | 317,557  \nAdvance to supplier-related party | 466,914  \nDue from related party | 752,066  \nInventory | 308,481  \nTotal current assets | 2,094,988  \nFixed assets, net | 74,158  \nIntangible assets, net | 12,914  \nRight of use assets | 207,995  \nTotal non-current assets | 295,067  \nTotal assets | 2,390,055  \nAccounts payable | $| 41,503  \nAccounts payable-related party | 315,361  \nTax payable | 13,225  \nDue to related party-existing companies | 103,939  \nCustomer deposits | 45,074  \nAccrued expense | 135,087  \nFacility lease liability-current | 229,201  \nTotal current liabilities | 883,390  \nFacility lease liability-long term | 81,506  \nTotal liabilities | 964,896  \n  \n41  \n---  \n  \nThe following table shows the results of operations relating to discontinued operations Shuya for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nNINE MONTHS ENDED September 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nRevenues | $| - | $| 6,422,915  \nCost of goods sold | - | 5,988,229  \nGross profit | - | 434,686  \nOperating expenses  \nSelling | - | 182,728  \nGeneral and administrative | - | 64,145  \nTotal operating expenses | - | 246,873  \nIncome from operations | - | 187,813  \n-  \nOther income | - | 2,329  \nIncome before income tax | - | 190,142  \nIncome tax | - | 8,973  \nIncome before noncontrolling interest | - | 181,169  \nLess: income attributable to noncontrolling interest | - | 92,396  \nNet gain to the Company | $| - | $| 88,773  \n  \n**NOTE 16 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nAs of the day of November 19, 2024, the Company issued 300,000 shares for conversion of Series E Preferred share and dividend valued at $170,464. \n\nOn October 15, 2024, Clean Energy Technology, Inc.

Prior to the first quarter of 2022 the Company had three reportable segments but added the CETY HK segment to reflect its recent new businesses in China.\n\nWe specialize in renewable energy & energy efficiency systems design, manufacturing and project implementation. We were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc. We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We provided engineering and manufacturing electronics services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of clean energy, industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products.\n\nWith the vision to combat climate change and creating a better, cleaner and environmentally sustainable future, we formed Clean Energy HRS, LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. and acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International on September 11, 2015. In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. We have 24 full-time employees.\n\nClean Energy Technologies, Inc. established a new company, CETY Europe, SRL (CETY Europe) as a wholly owned subsidiary.

Limited., a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean Energy Technologies Inc. acquired 100% ownership of Leading Wave Limited a liquid natural gas trading company in China.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n**General**\n\nThe Company’s business and operating results are directly affected by changes in overall customer demand, operational costs and performance and leverage of our fixed cost and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) infrastructure.\n\nProduct sales fluctuate in response to several factors including many that are beyond the Company’s control, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, government regulations, consumer spending, labor availability, and our customers’ production rates and inventory levels. Product sales consist of demand from customers in many different markets with different levels of cyclicality and seasonality.\n\nOperating performance is dependent on the Company’s ability to manage changes in input costs for items such as raw materials, labor, and overhead operating costs. Performance is also affected by manufacturing efficiencies, including items such as on time delivery, quality, scrap, and productivity. Market factors of supply and demand can impact operating costs.\n\n**Who We Are**\n\nWe develop renewable energy products and solutions and establish partnerships in renewable energy that make environmental and economic sense. Our mission is to be a segment leader in the Zero Emission Revolution by offering recyclable energy solutions, clean energy fuels and alternative electric power for small and mid-sized projects in North America, Europe, and Asia. We target sustainable energy solutions that are profitable for us, profitable for our customers and represent the future of global energy production.\n\n**Our principal businesses**\n\n**Waste Heat Recovery Solutions** – we recycle wasted heat produced in manufacturing, waste to energy and power generation facilities using our patented Clean CycleTM generator to create electricity which can be recycled or sold to the grid.\n\n**Waste to Energy Solutions** - we convert waste products created in manufacturing, agriculture, wastewater treatment plants and other industries to electricity, renewable natural gas (“RNG”), hydrogen and biochar which are sold or used by our customers.\n\n**Engineering, Consulting and Project Management Solutions** – we bring a wealth of experience in developing clean energy projects for municipal and industrial customers and Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies so they can identify, design and incorporate clean energy solutions in their projects.\n\n**Clean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited (“CETY HK”)** – our natural gas (“NG”) trading operations source and supply NG to industries and municipalities in mainland China. NG is principally used for heavy truck refueling stations and urban or industrial users. We purchase large quantities of NG from large wholesale NG depots at fixed prices which are prepaid for in advance at a discount to the market. We sell the NG to our customers at fixed prices or prevailing daily spot prices for the duration of the contracts.\n\n44  \n---  \n  \n**Business and Segment Information**\n\nWe design, produce and market clean energy products and integrated solutions focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy. Our aim is to become a leading provider of renewable and energy efficiency products and solutions by helping commercial companies and municipalities reduce energy waste and emissions, lower energy costs and generate incremental revenue by providing electricity, renewable natural gas and biochar to the grid.\n\n**Summary of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Same Period in 2023**\n\n**Going Concern**\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a negative working capital of $778,464 as of September 30, 2024, The company also had an accumulated deficit of $26,643,673 as of September 30, 2024 and used $2,788,608 in net cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenue was $1,944,333 compared to $5,278,203 for the same period in 2023. Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the same period in 2023 due to deconsolidation of the China operations.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit was $641,575 compared to $992,943 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin was due to lower revenue from China operations.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our operating expense was $3,193,447 compared to $2,463,090 for the same period in 2023. The increase in expenses was due to higher salaries expenses, professional fees for legal & accounting, for stock compensation for loan inducements.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of $3,550,669 compared to net loss of $2,460,489 for the same period in 2023 due to increase in salaries fir the CETY Renewable engineering Team, professional fees for legal, accounting, IR, and stock compensation.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, stockholder’s equity was $3,583,444, compared to $5,869,198 as of September 30, 2023. This decrease in stockholder’s equity can be attributed to loss of revenue from China operations and lower profits,\n\nCETY has successfully repositioned itself and created 4 different business segments to create a larger, more stable, and more diversified revenue stream that could scale up. The 4 segments are Clean Energy HRS (Heat Recovery), Waste-to-Energy (Pyrolysis Plant), Engineering and manufacturing services, and CETY HK (NG trading and acquisitions). Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly contributed by NG trading and waste to energy project. CETY expects larger revenue contribution from Waste-to-Energy, Heat Recovery, and EPC next year which are higher gross margin segments. Our pilot Waste-to-Energy plant in Vermont which integrates all of CETY’s technologies and expertise into a single solution, is progressing steadily with delays related to permitting. There is a growing market for Heat Recovery in the U.S. and Europe, and CETY HK has begun cross-selling Heat Recovery products in China. CETY is also gearing up for the EPC segment to implement holistic self-generation solutions globally.\n\n45  \n---  \n  \nManagement believes this 4-segment strategy has created many operational synergies and cross-selling opportunities across different markets. The growth in the year ended in 2023 was a result of this strategy. CETY believes that it will continue to deliver growth on all segments due to our belief that there is an optimistic industry macro backdrop. The main macro factor benefiting us is the global commitment to push renewable energy to the forefront from governments across the world. This is evidenced by the Paris Agreement and COP26. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in August 2022 had specific provisions that can take advantage of CETY’s products and solutions. Another catalyst that will potentially help our Company, is a continuously improving global supply chain. The European energy crisis has given rise to the opportunity for CETY to sell more of its products and solutions as customers are in search of self-generation capabilities in renewable energy.\n\nCETY expects to and will continue to execute its corporate strategy to build sustained and profitable growth by providing end to end fully integrated solutions and technologies, expand our global sales and marketing, production, research & development, as well as search for synergistic acquisition opportunities.\n\n**See note 1 to the notes to the financial statements for a discussion on critical accounting policies**\n\n**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**See note 12 to the notes to the financial statements for a discussion on related party transaction**\n\n**Results of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\n**Net Sales**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our total revenue was $1,944,333 compared to $5,278,203 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to deconsolidation of our China subsidiary.\n\n**Segment breakdown**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue from Engineering and Manufacturing was $0 compared to $59,877 for the same period in 2023. Our engineering team has been working on the Vermont project, additionally, some of our engineering revenue is rolled up into our waste heat to power.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue from HRS was $158,830 compared to $399,136 for the same period in 2023. We have a large pipeline of opportunities in this segment and are working diligently to complete the engineering and design, enabling us to execute contractual agreements and close these opportunities. The sales cycle for these types of opportunities is long due to cost factors and the integration of the technology. We are also working with financial institutions to assist in financing the projects as we increasingly move towards Independent Power Producer models.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue from our waste to energy segment was $231,679 compared to $779,720 for the same period in 2023. We have a large $12M contract with Vermont Renewable Gas in this segment and are currently finalizing the certificate of public good permitting to start the construction. We anticipate exponentially higher revenue driven from this segment.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue from our natural gas (NG) business amounted to $1,185,178, down from $10,462,385 for the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease can be attributed to the deconsolidation of Shuya’s revenue, overall substantial lower revenue from China operations due to slow down in economy and our strategic decision to prioritize non-Chinese markets over expansion into the ASEAN region.\n\n**Gross Profit**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profits totaled $641,575, marking higher margins compared to $992,943 recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. This lower gross profit can be attributed to higher revenue and margins from non-Chinese NG business.\n\n46  \n---  \n  \n**Segment breakdown**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit from Engineering and Manufacturing amounted to $0, compared to $16,528 for the same period in 2023. This segment is a recent addition to CETY’s portfolio, currently serving as a support for our ongoing internal projects. Nevertheless, it is anticipated to expand notably as CETY shifts its focus towards providing comprehensive end-to-end integrated solutions.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit from HRS was $96,961 compared to $148,706 for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase in margins primarily stemmed from increased service activities, which did not include equipment sales.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit from waste to energy was $549,947, compared to $738,243 for the corresponding period in 2023. Our waste to energy segment will be driving higher margins than our other segments.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our gross profit from our wholly owned subsidiary, JHJ, was $0, a decrease from $524,152 recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. It’s worth noting that our NG business typically operates on slim margins. Looking ahead, we intend to leverage our presence in China to foster synergistic partnerships and facilitate technology transfers, particularly in the growing EV charging sector. Additionally, we aim to explore cross-selling opportunities for our waste heat recovery and waste-to-energy products within the Chinese market.\n\n**Selling, General and Administrative (SG &A) Expenses**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our SG&A expenses totaled $3,193,447, an increase from $2,463,090 for the same period in 2023. This increase can be attributed to higher expenses from higher salaries from our Newley formed CETY Renewables, professional fees legal & accounting, and stock compensation for loan inducement.\n\n**Salaries Expense**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Salaries expense totaled $1,481,316, marking an increase from $957,759 recorded during the same period in 2023. This increase in expenses can be attributed to the inclusion of key personnel such as our CFO, director of operations, director of technology, and the recruitment of four additional engineers for CETY Renewables, and increased in work force in our NG operations. Our strategy involves fortifying our team from the ground up to establish a robust foundation for scalable growth, reinforced by cutting-edge technology and streamlined systems. We hold strong conviction in the capabilities of our assembled team, envisioning their collective efforts leading us to a position of leadership within the clean energy sector.\n\n**Travel Expense**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our travel expense was $135,964 compared to $326,905 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to less business travels in our China subsidiaries.\n\n**Professional fees legal and accounting**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Professional Fees expense totaled $484,990, marking an increase from $259,476 in the corresponding period of 2023. This rise in accounting fees can be attributed directly to engaging a new audit firm, which incurred higher costs.\n\n**Facility Lease and Maintenance Expense**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our facility lease and maintenance expenses totaled $230,798, marking a significant decrease from the $253,041 incurred during the same period in 2023. This decrease in cost can be attributed to relocating our Heat Recovery Solutions and headquarters to a lower cost facility.\n\n**Consulting**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our consulting expense was $195,640 compared to $ 244,540 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to less market awareness and IR activities.\n\n**Depreciation and Amortization Expense**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our depreciation and amortization expense was $8,907 compared to $9,436 for the same period in 2023.\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n**Change in Derivative Liability**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 0 derivative liability compared to a gain of $326,539 for the same period in 2023. The gain in derivative liability was from a favorable derivative calculation from several convertible notes in the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\n**Interest and Finance Fees**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest and finance fees amounted to $902,002, as opposed to $1,707,690 for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in interest and fees can be attributed to lower amount of borrowing. Despite the decrease in interest and fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we believe that the cost of capital for CETY remains elevated. The delay in securing affordable financing for our Vermont project resulted in our reliance on high-cost financing options. We are working diligently to finalize our financing in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**Net Loss**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our loss amounted to $3,550,669, representing an increase from the loss of $2,460,489 incurred during the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is attributed to lower revenues and higher SG&A expenses.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n**Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.**\n\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\nFor nine months ended September 30,\n\n(unaudited)\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nNet cash (used in) operating activities | $| (2,788,608| ) | $| (3,842,232| )  \nNet cash provided by investing activities | 83,340 | 14,111  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | 2,660,036 | 3,906,498  \nForeign Currency Transaction | 241 | 36,165  \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents | $| (45,477| ) | $| 114,542  \n  \n**Capital Requirements for Long-Term Obligations**\n\nNone.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies**\n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\n\n48  \n---  \n  \nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, _“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”_ (“ASC 606”).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10_\n\nAn entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\na. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).\n\nb. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).\n\nc. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our business:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \n_Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-30_\n\nIf a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\n\nb. The customer has legal title to the asset\n\nc. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\n\nd. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\n\ne. The customer has accepted the asset\n\n49  \n---  \n  \nThe core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and CETY Europe Divisions:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \nThe following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:\n\n● | We generate a quotation  \n---|---  \n● | We receive Purchase orders from our customers.  \n● | We build the product to their specification  \n● | We invoice at the time of shipment  \n● | The terms are typically Net 30 days  \n  \nThe following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:\n\n● | CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service.   \n---|---  \n  \n_A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):_\n\na. | A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer to the customer may not qualify.  \n---|---  \nb. | A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.  \nc. | A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer.  \n  \nIf the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.\n\nDuring the project development and engineering phase of our CETY Renewable projects such as VRG, we employ the input method of revenue recognition to estimate revenue based on projected costs. This approach involves forecasting future costs and revenues to determine the amount of revenue we recognize in the current period. It’s important to understand, however, that these recognized revenue figures are not final and are subject to adjustments. Changes may occur as we gain more clarity on actual costs compared to our initial projections, affecting the revenue recognized accordingly.\n\n50  \n---  \n  \nThe projected costs of the VRG project is based on estimates and profitability will be impacted depending on actual costs. Using the input method for revenue recognition, the amount of recorded revenue is also affected depending on the estimated total costs. The purchase price allocation for Shuya was also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company. The inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company.\n\nAdditionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:\n\nBecause the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.\n\nIn recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.\n\n● | The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n● | CETY and customer agree to a total EPC Contract price.  \n● | The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.  \n● | Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.  \n  \nSecondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with the its agreement with its clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.\n\nCETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.\n\nCETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There are no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.\n\nIn review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.\n\nIn reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.\n\nFinally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.\n\n51  \n---  \n  \nFor CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nDuring the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.\n\nWe have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.\n\nAlso, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $33,000 and $33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of year 2024.\n\nAlso from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of September 30,2024, and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding customer deposits of $41,462 and $210,310 respectively.\n\n**Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation**\n\nChengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (the “Xiangyueheng”), which owns a 10% equity interest in Shuya, entered a three-party Concerted Action Agreement (the “CAA”), wherein the parties agreed to vote in unison at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agreed that during the term of the CAA, before any of the three parties intends to propose motions to the shareholders’ meetings or the board of directors, or exercise their voting rights on any matter that shall be presented to and resolved through the shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the laws, regulations, Articles of Association of Shuya or any relevant shareholders’ agreements, the three parties will discuss, negotiate, and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.\n\nAs a result of the CAA, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (the “VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nOn January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n52  \n---  \n  \n**Series E Valuation**\n\nAdditionally, the inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company and fair value measurements, furthermore, the purchase price allocation was based on estimates of fair market values.\n\n**Future Financing**\n\nWe will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.\n\n**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**\n\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.\n\n**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures.**\n\n**_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_**\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024, for a complete discussion relating to the foregoing evaluation of Disclosures and Procedures.\n\n**_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**\n\nOur management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \n**PART II—OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. The Company is presently not involved in any legal proceedings which in the opinion of management are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors.**\n\nThere have been no material changes in the Company’s risk factors from those previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024.\n\n**Item 2.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this report.\n\nForward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning the following:\n\n● | our possible or assumed future results of operations;  \n---|---  \n● | our business strategies;  \n● | our ability to attract and retain customers;  \n● | our ability to sell additional products and services to customers;  \n● | our cash needs and financing plans;  \n● | our competitive position;  \n● | our industry environment;  \n● | our potential growth opportunities;  \n● | expected technological advances by us or by third parties and our ability to leverage them;  \n● | Our inability to predict or anticipate the duration or long-term economic and business consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;  \n● | the effects of future regulation;  \n● | our ability to protect or monetize our intellectual property;  \n● | changes in United States and China trade policies and relations, as well as relations with other countries, and/or changes in regulations and/or sanctions;  \n● | the impact on us from the actions the Chinese government may take to intervene in or influence our operations;  \n● | the impact on us from the uncertainties in the Chinese legal system, such as Chinese regulations regarding acquisitions of companies based in mainland China by foreign investors and the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to make payments to us; and  \n● | approval, filing, or procedural requirements imposed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) or other Chinese regulatory authorities in connection with issuing securities to foreign investors under Chinese law.  \n  \n3  \n---  \n  \nYou should read any other cautionary statements made in this report as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this report will prove to be accurate and therefore prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. You should read this report completely. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n\n**Disclosures Relating to Our Chinese Operations**\n\nClean Energy Technologies Inc. is a company incorporated in the State of Nevada with operations in North America, Europe, and Asia, including in China. Our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya, an entity in which we own a 49% equity interest, operate our natural gas trading operations in China to source and supply natural gas to industries and municipalities located in China. Throughout this report, unless the context requires otherwise, (i) “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. on a consolidated basis with its wholly-owned subsidiaries; (ii) “the PRC Subsidiaries” refers specifically to those wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours located in the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong), which include Clean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited, Meishan Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., Hainan Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., Element Capital International Limited (H.K.), Sichuan Hunya Jieneng New Energy Co. LTD, and Jiangsu Huanya Jieneng New Energy Co., Ltd.; and (iii) “Shuya” refers to Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited.\n\nWe face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties due to our operations in China. Our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya could be adversely affected by uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system. Rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice. The interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations involve additional uncertainties. Since administrative and court authorities in China have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. In addition, the Chinese government exercises significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of the business of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya and may intervene in or influence their operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals, which could result in a material change in their operations in China and/or the value of the securities we are registering for sale, including causing the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Furthermore, the Chinese government has recently exerted more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies. Any such actions, once taken by the Chinese government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\n\nRecently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. We do not believe that we, our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya are directly subject to these regulatory actions or statements; however, because these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative rule making bodies in China will respond to them, or what existing or new laws or regulations will be modified or promulgated, if any, or the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on the daily business operations or ability to accept foreign investments of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya. On December 24, 2021, nine government agencies jointly issued the Opinions on Promoting the Healthy and Sustainable Development of Platform Economy, which provides that, among others, monopolistic agreements, abuse of dominant market position and illegal concentration of business operators in the field of platform economy will be strictly investigated and punished in accordance with the relevant laws. Neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya hold a dominant market position in their product markets and they have not entered into any monopolistic agreement. Neither have they received any inquiry from the relevant governmental authorities. The Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”), together with 12 other Chinese regulatory authorities, released the final version of the Revised Measures for Cybersecurity Review, or the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, in December 2021, which took effect on February 15, 2022. Pursuant to the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, critical information infrastructure operators procuring network products and services and online platform operators carrying out data processing activities, which affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review pursuant to the provisions therein. In addition, online platform operators possessing personal information of more than one million users seeking to be listed on foreign stock markets must apply for a cybersecurity review. On November 14, 2021, the CAC published the Draft Regulations on the Network Data Security Administration (Draft for Comments) (the “Security Administration Draft”), which provides that data processing operators engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect national security must be subject to cybersecurity review by the relevant Cyberspace Administration of the PRC. We do not believe that our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya are “online platform operators” within the meaning of the Revised Cybersecurity Measures, and neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya currently possess over one million Chinese users’ personal information and do not anticipate that they will be collecting over one million Chinese users’ personal information in the foreseeable future. In addition, neither our PRC Subsidiaries nor Shuya will be subject to Security Administration Draft if the Security Administration Draft is enacted as proposed, since they currently do not collect data that affects or may affect national security and we do not anticipate that our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya will be collecting data that affects or may affect national security in the foreseeable future.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \nOn February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of the Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, and the relevant five guidelines, which became effective on March 31, 2023. The Trial Measures comprehensively reformed the existing regulatory regime for overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities and will regulate both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing of PRC domestic companies’ securities by adopting a filing-based regulatory regime. Pursuant to the Trial Measures, PRC domestic companies that seek to offer and list securities in overseas markets, either in direct or indirect means, are required to fulfill the filing procedure with the CSRC and report relevant information. The Trial Measures provides that if the issuer meets both of the following criteria, the overseas securities offering and listing conducted by such issuer will be deemed as indirect overseas offering by PRC domestic companies: (i) 50% or more of any of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent fiscal year is accounted for by domestic companies; and (ii) the principal parts of the issuer’s business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its principal place(s) of business are located in mainland China, or the majority of senior management staff in charge of its business operations and management are PRC citizens or have their usual place(s) of residence located in mainland China. If we ever are required by the CSRC to submit and complete the filing procedures for our future offerings of our securities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete such filings in a timely manner, or even at all, which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. Any failure by us to comply with such filing requirements under the Trial Measures may result in rectification, warnings, and a fine between RMB 1 million and RMB 10 million on our PRC Subsidiaries or Shuya, which could adversely and materially affect our business operations and financial outlook and could cause the value of our common stock to significantly decline or, in extreme cases, become worthless.\n\nAs of the date of this report, these new laws and guidelines have not impacted the ability of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya to conduct business and accept foreign investments; however, if (i) we inadvertently conclude that permissions or approvals are not required from applicable PRC authorities or (ii) applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change, and we are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, our ability to conduct our business in China may be materially impacted, the interest of the investors may be materially and adversely affected and our common stock may significantly decrease in value.\n\nIn addition, we face risks associated with the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA. Trading in our securities on U.S. markets, including Nasdaq, may be prohibited under the HFCAA if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, determines that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor for two consecutive years. Pursuant to the HFCAA, the PCAOB issued a Determination Report on December 16, 2021, which found that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong because of positions taken by the authorities in those jurisdictions. In addition, the PCAOB’s report identified the specific registered public accounting firms which are subject to these determinations. On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol Agreement with the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance (the “MOF”) of the PRC governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China or Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced in the 2022 Determination its determination that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, and the PCAOB Board voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary. Should the PCAOB again encounter impediments to inspections and investigations in mainland China or Hong Kong as a result of positions taken by any authority in either jurisdiction, including by the CSRC or the MOF, the PCAOB will make determinations under the HFCAA as and when appropriate. Both our current auditor, TAAD LLP, and our former auditor, Fruci & Associates II, PLLC, are headquartered in the United States and, as PCAOB-registered public accounting firms, they are required to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its compliance with the laws of the U.S. and professional standards. TAAD LLP and Fruci & Associates II, PLLC have been subject to PCAOB inspections and are not among the PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC or Hong Kong that are subject to PCAOB’s determination of having been unable to inspect or investigate completely. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, if there is any regulatory change or step taken by PRC regulators that does not permit our auditor to provide audit documentations located in China or Hong Kong to the PCAOB for inspection or investigation, or the PCAOB expands the scope of the Determination so that we are subject to the HFCAA, as the same may be amended, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection. Any audit reports not issued by auditors that are completely inspected or investigated by the PCAOB, or a lack of PCAOB inspections of audit work undertaken in China that prevents the PCAOB from regularly evaluating our auditors’ audits and their quality control procedures, could result in a lack of assurance that our financial statements and disclosures are adequate and accurate, which could result in limitation or restriction to our access to the U.S. capital markets, and trading of our securities, including trading on the national exchange and trading on “over-the-counter” markets, may be prohibited under the HFCAA and our securities may be delisted by an exchange.\n\nCash may be transferred within our organization in the following manners: (i) Clean Energy Technologies Inc. may transfer funds to the PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya by way of capital contributions or loans, through intermediate holding subsidiaries or otherwise, as investments or lendings, (ii) the PRC Subsidiaries may make dividends or other distributions to Clean Energy Technologies Inc. through intermediate holding companies or otherwise, and (iii) Shuya may make dividends or other distributions to Clean Energy Technologies Inc., which indirectly owns a 49% equity interest in Shuya, through intermediate holding companies or otherwise. Our abilities to use cash held in PRC or in a PRC entity to fund operations or for other purposes outside of the PRC are subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by the PRC government. Current PRC regulations only permit a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or WFOE, to pay dividends to its offshore parent company out of their retained earnings, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the majority of the revenues of our PRC Subsidiaries and Shuya are collected in RMB. Thus, foreign exchange shortages and foreign exchange control may also limit their ability to pay dividends or make other payments or otherwise meet our obligations denominated in foreign currencies. Furthermore, we may lose our ability to fund operations or for other uses outside of Hong Kong using cash in Hong Kong or a Hong Kong entity if, in the future, the scope of the current restrictions and limitations applicable to PRC entities were to expand to include Hong Kong or entities based in Hong Kong. Therefore, our ability to transfer cash between PRC entities and entities outside of PRC may be restricted. As of the date of this report, (i) we have transferred $2,671,700 in total to our PRC Subsidiaries, and (ii) JHJ, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the PRC, has transferred $701,836 in total to Shuya as a capital contribution for the formation of Shuya.

All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\n\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year end December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have access to, the audited financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nThe summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.\n\n**Corporate History**\n\nWe were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc. We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We manufactured electronics and provided services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products. On September 11, 2015 Clean Energy HRS, or “CE HRS”, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International. In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1340 Reynolds Avenue, Irvine, CA 92614. Our telephone number is (949) 273-4990. Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CETY.”\n\nOur internet website address is www.cetyinc.com. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this document, and you should not consider any information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website as part of this document.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy Heat Recovery Solutions (HRS) & CETY Europe, CETY Renewables waste to energy, engineering & manufacturing services, and CETY HK NG trading.\n\n**Going Concern**\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder’s equity of $4,579,726 and a working capital of $300,071 as of June 30, 2024. The company also had an accumulated deficit of $25,429,293 as of June 30, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**Plan of Operation**\n\nCETY is a rising leader in the zero-emission revolution by providing eco-friendly energy solutions, clean energy fuels, and alternative electric power for small to mid-sized projects across North America, Europe, and Asia. The company harnesses the power of heat and biomass to produce electricity with zero emissions and minimal cost.

(formerly Probe Manufacturing, Inc.) is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates may be materially different from actual financial results. Significant estimates include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the collection of accounts receivable and valuation of inventory and reserves.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nWe maintain the majority of our cash accounts at JP Morgan Chase bank. The total cash balance is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000, (which we may exceed from time to time) per commercial bank. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows we consider all cash and highly liquid investments with initial maturities of one year or less to be cash equivalents.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**Accounts Receivable**\n\nOur ability to collect receivables is affected by economic fluctuations in the geographic areas and industries served by us. Reserves for un-collectable amounts are provided, based on past experience and a specific analysis of the accounts. Although we expect to collect amounts due, actual collections may differ from the estimated amounts. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable accounts receivable of $95,000 and $95,000, respectively. Our policy for reserves for our long-term financing receivables is determined on a contract-by-contract basis and considers the length of the financing arrangement. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable long-term financing receivables of $247,500 and $247,500, respectively.\n\n8 customers accounted for approximately 90% of accounts receivable on June 30, 2024. Our trade accounts primarily represent unsecured receivables. Historically, our bad debt write-offs related to these trade accounts have been insignificant.\n\n**Inventory**\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or net relizable value. Our industry experiences changes in technology, changes in market value and availability of raw materials, as well as changing customer demand. We make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventories based on regular audits and cycle counts of our on-hand inventory levels and forecasted customer demands and at times additional provisions are made. Any inventory write offs are charged to the reserve account. As of June 30, 2024 we had a reserve of $934,344 as compared to a reserve of $934,344 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Property and Equipment**\n\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Assets held under capital leases are recorded at lease inception at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets. The cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES\n\nFurniture and fixtures | 3 to 5 years  \n---|---  \n  \n**Goodwill**\n\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, _Intangibles—Goodwill and Other_. Under ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of underlying identifiable net assets of business acquired.\n\nThe Company tests goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events arise or circumstances change that indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company assesses whether goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed, as required by ASC 350, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists.\n\nThe quantitative test is used to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The determination of the fair value of the Company’s reporting units is based, among other things, on estimates of the future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued. A goodwill impairment test is required to be completed, at minimum, once annually, and any resulting impairment loss recorded upon completion of the assessment. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \nWhen performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company’s methodology includes the use of an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the Company’s cost of capital, otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method (“DCF”). These estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses. Factors affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products and services offered by the businesses, the development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development, the future cost structure of the businesses, and future technological changes. The Company also incorporates market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified.\n\n**Intangible Assets**\n\nThe Company’s intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangibles, licenses and patents. Upon acquisition, estimates are made in valuing acquired intangible assets, which include but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, and estimating cash flows from projects when completed; tradename and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time that customer relationships will continue; and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from the assumptions used in determining the fair values. All intangible assets are capitalized at their original cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\n**Long-Lived Assets**\n\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nRecoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, _“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”_ (“ASC 606”).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10_\n\n15  \n---  \n  \nAn entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\na. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).\n\nb. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).\n\nc. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-30_\n\nIf a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\n\nb. The customer has legal title to the asset\n\nc. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\n\nd. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\n\ne. The customer has accepted the asset\n\nThe core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition, a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \nThe following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:\n\n● | We generate a quotation  \n---|---  \n● | We receive Purchase orders from our customers.  \n● | We build the product to their specification  \n● | We invoice at the time of shipment  \n● | The terms are typically Net 30 days  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \nThe following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:\n\n● | CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service.   \n---|---  \n  \n_A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):_\n\na. | A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer to the customer may not qualify.  \n---|---  \nb. | A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.  \nc. | A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer.  \n  \nIf the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.\n\nAdditionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:\n\nBecause the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.\n\nIn recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.\n\n● | The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY and customer agree to a total EPC contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.  \n---|---  \n  \nSecondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with its agreement with clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.\n\nCETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.\n\nCETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There is no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \nIn review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.\n\nIn reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.\n\nFinally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.\n\nFor CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nDuring the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.\n\nWe have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.\n\nAlso, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $33,000 and $33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of year 2024.\n\nAlso from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of June 30,2024, and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding customer deposits of $41,462 and $165,236 respectively.\n\n**Fair Value of Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 820-10 (SFAS No. 157), “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:\n\n● | Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  \n---|---  \n● | Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.  \n● | Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s derivative liabilities have been valued as Level 3 instruments. We value the derivative liability using a lattice model, with a volatility of 56% and using a risk free interest rate of 0.15%  \n  \n18  \n---  \n  \nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and convertible notes payable. The estimated fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses and convertible notes payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n**Foreign Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)**\n\nWe have no material components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods. The accounts of the Company’s Chinese entities are maintained in RMB. The accounts of the Chinese entities were translated into USD in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters.” All assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; stockholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income.” Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the statements of operations.\n\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 220-10, “Comprehensive Income (loss).” Comprehensive income (loss) comprises net income (loss) and all changes to the statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in additional paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders.\n\n**Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation**\n\nIn July 2022, JHJ and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHK owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022, JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya.\n\nShuya was set up as the operating entity for pipeline natural gas (PNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) trading business, while the other two shareholders of Shuaya have large supply relationships.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that Shuya was not a VIE and has evaluated its consolidation analysis under the voting interest model. Because the Company does not own greater than 50% of the outstanding voting shares, either directly or indirectly, it has accounted for its investment in Shuya under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investor (“JHJ”) recognizes its share of the profits and losses of the investee (“Shuya”) in the periods when these profits and losses are also reflected in the accounts of the investee. Any profit or loss recognized by the investing entity appears in its income statement. Also, any recognized profit increases the investment recorded by the investing entity, while a recognized loss decreases the investment.\n\nJHJ made a investment of RMB 3.91 million ($0.55 million) into Shuya during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 recorded in accordance with ASC 323. Shuya had a net loss of approximately $10,750 during the year ending December 31, 2022, of which approximately $5,000 was allocated to the company, reducing the investment by that amount.\n\nHowever, effective January 1, 2023, JHJ, SSEN and Chengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (“Xiangyueheng), who is the 10% shareholder of Shuya, entered a Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, wherein these three shareholders (or three parties) will guarantee that the voting rights will be expressed in the same way at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agree that within the validity period of this agreement, before the party intends to propose the motions to the shareholders or the board of directors on the major matters related to the voting rights of the shareholders or the board of directors, the three parties internally will discuss, negotiate and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of Consistent Action Agreement, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (“VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nThe change of control interest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, referred to as ASC, 805, Business Combinations. The management determined that the Company was the acquiror for financial accounting purposes. In identifying the Company as the accounting acquiror, the companies considered the structure of the transaction and other actions contemplated by the Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, relative outstanding share ownership and market values, the composition of the combined company’s board of directors, the relative size of Shuya, and the designation of certain senior management positions of the combined company.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 805, the Company recorded the acquisition based on the fair value of the consideration transferred and then allocated the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of the value of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair value of those net assets was recorded as goodwill. Any identified definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives and any identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The valuation of purchase considerations was based on preliminary estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nAs the Consistent Action Agreement did not quantify any considerations to gain the control, the deemed consideration paid is the fair value of 51% non-controlling interest as of January 1, 2023. The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on January 1, 2023, the acquisition date.\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED\n\nFair value of non-controlling interests | $| 650,951  \n---|---|---  \nFair value of previously held equity investment | 556,096  \nSubtotal | $| 1,207,047  \nRecognized value of 100% of identifiable net assets | (1,207,047| )  \nGoodwill Recognized | $| -  \nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (preliminary):  \nInventories | $| 516,131  \nCash and cash equivalents | 50,346  \nTrade and other receivables | 952,384  \nAdvanced deposit | 672,597  \nNet fixed assets | 6,704  \nTrade and other payables | (1,021,897| )  \nAdvanced payments | (5,317| )  \nSalaries and wages payables | (4,692| )  \nOther receivable | 40,791  \nTotal identifiable net assets | $| 1,207,047  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \nUnder ASC-805-10-50-2, initial consolidation of an investee previously reported using fair value or the equity method should be accounted for prospectively as of the date the entity obtained a controlling financial interest. Therefore, the Company should provide pro forma information as if the consolidation had occurred as of the beginning of each of the current and prior comparative reporting period per\n\nOn January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n**Net (Loss) per Common Share**\n\nBasic (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. As of June 30, 2024, we had outstanding common shares of 44,576,381. Basic and diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, were 41,618,349 and 37,939,667 respectively. As of June 30, 2024, we had convertible notes convertible into approximately 2,811,390 of additional common shares and additional 5,423,389 common shares underlying our outstanding warrants. Fully diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents were withheld from the calculation for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 as they were considered anti-dilutive.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nWe had no amounts of research and development (R&D) expense during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June, 30, 2023.\n\n**Segment Disclosure**\n\nFASB Codification Topic 280, _Segment Reporting_ , establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about an enterprise’s reportable segments. The Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy Heat Recovery Solutions (HRS) & CETY Europe, CETY renewables waste to energy, engineering & manufacturing services, and CETY HK NG trading. The segments are determined based on several factors, including the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, customer base, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics. Refer to note 1 for a description of the various product categories manufactured under each of these segments.\n\nAn operating segment’s performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net sales less cost of sales, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, other charges (income), net and interest and other, net.\n\n**Selected Financial Data** :\n\nSCHEDULE OF FINANCIAL DATA\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nFor the six months ended June 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nNet Sales  \nManufacturing and Engineering | $| 9341 | $| 36,332  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 120,874 | 28,338  \nNG Trading | 1,219,629 | 2,796,649  \nWaste to Energy | 359,307 | 412,682  \nDiscontinued operations | - | 4,422,400  \nTotal Sales | $| 1,709,151 | $| 7,696,401  \nSegment income and reconciliation before tax  \nManufacturing and Engineering | 7,806 | 18,355  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 79,889 | 30  \nLNG Trading | 9,853 | 40,293  \nWaste to Energy | 331,487 | 385,404  \nTotal Segment income | 429,035 | 444,082  \nLess: operating expense | (2,221,990| ) | (1,498,702| )  \nLess: other income and expenses | (458,323| ) | (813,543| )  \nNet (loss) before income tax | $| (2,251,278| ) | $| (1,868,163| )  \n  \n21  \n---  \n  \nJune 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nTotal Assets  \nManufacturing and Engineering | $| 2,801,567 | $| 2,544,786  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 3,222,939 | 3,099,223  \nWaste to Energy | 830,956 | 486,572  \nLNG Trading | 2,457,449 | 4,798,030  \nTotal Assets | $| 9,312,911 | $| 10,928,611  \n  \nThe following table represents revenue by geographic area based on the sales location of our products and solutions:\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nFor the six months ended June 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nUnited States | 482,435 | 449,014  \nChina (include discontinued operation: $4,422,400) | 1,219,629 | 7,219,049  \nOther international | 7,087 | 28,338  \nTotal Sales | 1,709,151 | 7,696,401  \n  \n**Share-Based Compensation**\n\nThe Company has adopted the use of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) (now contained in FASB Codification Topic 718, _Compensation-Stock Compensation_), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and its related implementation guidance and eliminates the alternative to use Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement 123 as originally issued. This Statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instruments, which includes grants of stock options and stock warrants, based on the fair value of the award, measured at the grant date (with limited exceptions). Under this standard, the fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date, using an option-pricing model that meets certain requirements. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards, including stock options and warrants. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of SFAS No. 123R; however, the fair values generated may not reflect their actual fair values, as it does not consider certain factors, such as vesting requirements, employee attrition and transferability limitations. The Black-Scholes model valuation is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected volatility and estimated life of our stock options at grant date based on historical volatility. For the “risk-free interest rate,” we use the Constant Maturity Treasury rate on 90-day government securities. The term is equal to the time until the option expires. The dividend yield is not applicable, as the Company has not paid any dividends, nor do we anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. The fair value of our restricted stock is based on the market value of our free trading common stock, on the grant date calculated using a 20-trading-day average. At the time of grant, the share-based compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest using historical employee attrition rates and the expense is reduced accordingly. It is also adjusted to account for the restricted and thinly traded nature of the shares. The expense is reviewed and adjusted in subsequent periods if actual attrition differs from those estimates.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \nWe re-evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on a quarterly basis and, if changes warrant different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount expensed in the past. We may be required to adjust any remaining share-based compensation expense, based on any additions, cancellations or adjustments to the share-based awards. The expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 we had $62,250 and $148,100 in share-based expense, respectively. As of June 30, 2024 we had no further non-vested expense to be recognized.\n\n**Leases**\n\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, or ASC 842, using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment to be accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019, and accordingly, modified its policy on accounting for leases as stated below. As described under “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements,” below, the primary impact of adopting ASC 842 for the Company was the recognition in the consolidated balance sheet of certain lease-related assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms longer than 12 months.\n\nThe Company’s leases primarily consist of facility leases which are classified as operating leases. The Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company recognizes a lease liability to make contractual payments under all leases with terms greater than twelve months and a corresponding right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term using the collateralized incremental borrowing rate since the implicit rate is unknown. Options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such an option. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the contractual lease liability plus any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made, less any lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLeased right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing as a long-lived asset at the asset-group level. The Company monitors its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. As the Company’s leased right-of-use assets primarily relate to facility leases, early abandonment of all or part of facility as part of a restructuring plan is typically an indicator of impairment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company tests whether the carrying amount of the leased right-of-use asset is recoverable including consideration of sublease income, and if not recoverable, measures impairment loss for the right-of-use asset or asset group.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nFederal Income taxes are not currently due since we have had losses since inception of Clean Energy Technologies.\n\nOn December 22, 2018 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (“Federal Tax Rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company will compute its income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 using a Federal Tax Rate of 21% and an estimated state of California rate of 9%.\n\nIncome taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 _Income Taxes – Recognition._ Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than not” standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nDeferred income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $(15,737,415) and a deferred tax asset of $4,727,224 using the statutory rate of 30%. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked a valuation allowance of $(2,482,763). FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. On June 30, 2024 the Company did not take any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740.\n\nOn February 13, 2018, Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Registrant” or “Corporation”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (“Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and between MGW Investment I Limited (“MGWI”) and the Corporation. The Corporation received $907,388 in exchange for the issuance of 302,462,667 restricted shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Common Stock”).\n\nOn February 13, 2018, the Corporation and Confections Ventures Limited. (“CVL”) entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Convertible Note Purchase Agreement,” together with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder, the “Financing”) pursuant to which the Corporation issued to CVL a convertible promissory Note (the “CVL Note”) in the principal amount of $939,500 with an interest rate of 10% per annum interest rate and a maturity date of February 13, 2020. The CVL Note is convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.12 per share, as adjusted as provided therein. This note was assigned to MGW Investments.\n\nThis resulted in a change in control, which limited the net operating to that date forward. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and the states of California. Further, the Company currently has no open tax years’ subject to audit prior to December 31, 2015. The Company is current on its federal and state tax returns.\n\n**Reclassification**\n\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported income, total assets, or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**\n\n**Deferred Stock Issuance Costs**\n\nDeferred stock issuance costs represent amounts paid for legal, consulting, and other offering expenses in conjunction with the future raising of additional capital to be performed within one year. These costs are netted against additional paid-in capital as a cost of the stock issuance upon closing of the respective stock placement. \n\n**NOTE 3 – ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE**\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE\n\nJune 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts Receivable | $| 1,189,582 | 1,197,386  \nAccounts Receivable Related Party | 851,080 | 491,774  \nLess reserve for uncollectable accounts | (95,000| ) | (95,000| )  \nTotal | $| 1,945,662 | 1,594,160  \n  \n24  \n---  \n  \nOur Accounts Receivable is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\nSCHEDULE OF LEASE RECEIVABLE ASSET\n\nJune 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nLong-term financing receivables | $| 1,149,854 | $| 1,149,854  \nLess Reserve for uncollectable accounts | (247,500| ) | (247,500| )  \nLong-term financing receivables - net | $| 902,354 | $| 902,354  \n  \nThe Company is currently modifying the assets subject to lease to meet the provisions of the agreement, and as of June 30, 2024 any collection on the lease payments was not yet considered probable, resulting in no derecognition of the underlying asset and no net lease investments recognized on the sales-type lease pursuant to ASC 842-30-25-3.\n\nOn a contract-by-contract basis or projects that require extensive work from multiple contractors or supply chain challenges or in response to certain situations or installation difficulties, the Company may elect to allow non-interest bearing repayments in excess of 1 year.\n\nOur long-term financing receivable are pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 4 – INVENTORIES, NET**\n\nInventories by major classification were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INVENTORIES\n\nJune 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nInventory | $| 1,653,612 | 1,600,757  \nLess reserve for uncollectable accounts | (934,344| ) | (934,344| )  \nTotal | $| 719,268 | 666,413  \n  \nOur Inventory is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 5 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nProperty and equipment were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nJune 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nProperty and Equipment | $| 1,430,075 | 1,430,076  \nAccumulated Depreciation | (1,426,399| ) | (1,425,546| )  \nNet Fixed Assets | $| 3,676 | 4,530  \n  \nOur Depreciation Expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 was 2,969 and $3,254 (include depreciation expense of $2,075 from discontinued operation) respectively.\n\nOur property and equipment is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\nIntangible assets were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nJune 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nGoodwill | $| 747,976 | 747,976  \nLWL Intangibles | 1,468,709 | 1,468,709  \nIntangible assets - Shuya | - | 12,914  \nLicense | 354,322 | 354,322  \nPatents | 190,789 | 190,789  \nAccumulated Amortization | (104,910| ) | (98,972| )  \nNet Intangible Assets | $| 2,656,886 | 2,675,738  \n  \nOur Amortization Expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $5,938 and $2,969 (include amortization expense of $674 from discontinued operation) respectively.\n\n25  \n---  \n  \nBased on the foregoing analysis of the facts surrounding the Company’s acquisition of LWL, it is the Company’s position that the Company is the acquirer of LWL, under the acquisition method of accounting.\n\nAs such, as of November 8, 2021 (the acquisition date), the Company recognized, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the business combination.\n\nThe following table presents the purchase price allocation:\n\nSCHEDULE OF BUSINESS ACQUISITION PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION\n\nConsideration:  \n---  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 1,500,000  \nTotal purchaser consideration | $| 1,500,000  \nAssets acquired:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 6,156  \nPrepayment | 22,035  \nOther receivable | 20,000  \nTrading Contracts | 146,035  \nShenzhen Gas Relationship | 1,314,313  \nTotal assets acquired | 1,508,539  \nLiabilities assumed:  \nAdvance Receipts | $| (8,539| )  \nNet Assets Acquired: | $| 1,500,000  \n  \nIf LWL reaches USD 5 million in revenue or net profit of USD 1 million by December 31, 2023, then based on the performance contingency there would be an issuance of 500,000 shares of CETY to the Seller.

For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but has been updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted the above ASU as of January 1, 2019.

The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 49/51 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of 3 members. Two of the three members are from Synergy Bioproducts Corporation, and one is from CETY. Both parties do not have substantial capital at risk and CETY does not have voting interest. However, SBC has controlling interest and more board votes therefore SBC is the beneficiary of the VIE and as a result we record it as an equity investment. Accordingly, the Company has elected to account for the joint venture as an equity method investment in accordance with ASC 323 Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This decision is a result of the company’s evaluation of its involvement with potential variable interest entities and their respective risk and reward scenarios, which collectively affirm that the conditions necessitating the application of the variable interest model are not present.\n\nIn July 2022 JHJ and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHJ owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022 JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya. As a result of Consistent Action Agreement entered on December 31, 2022 the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (“VIE”) of JHJ, and the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023. The non-controlling interest of Shuya represents the 41% equity ownership that is owned by Leishen, and 10% equity ownership owned by another shareholder.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \nOn January 1, 2024 and effective on the same date., JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties release each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company has determined that Shuya no longer constitutes a VIE and the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n**NOTE 15 – DECONSOLIDATION OF SUBSIDIARY**\n\nOn January 1, 2024 and effective on the same date., JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties release each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company has determined that Shuya no longer constitutes a VIE and the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024. Accordingly, started from January 1, 2024, the Company deconsolidated Shuya. Under ASC 810-10-40-5, deconsolidation of a VIE generally results in recognition of a gain or loss in the income statement. In addition, any retained equity interest or investment in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value as of the date of deconsolidation. The consideration for deconsolidating of Shuya is $0, the Company used discounted cash flow method to evaluate the fair value of Shuya, and determined the fair value of retained equity interest for Shuya and NCI approximate its carry value; therefore, no gain or loss was recognized from deconsolidation of Shuya.\n\nThe Company recalculated the fair value of Shuya as of January 1, 2024 using the income approach at $1,387,213 and recorded a loss of $27,139 from deconsolidation of Shuya for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of Shuya at December 31, 2023.\n\nSCHEDULE OF CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nCash | $| 85,226  \n---|---|---  \nAccounts receivable | 164,744  \nAdvance to supplier-prepayment | 317,557  \nAdvance to supplier-related party | 466,914  \nDue from related party | 752,066  \nInventory | 308,481  \nTotal current assets | 2,094,988  \nFixed assets, net | 74,158  \nIntangible assets, net | 12,914  \nRight of use assets | 207,995  \nTotal non-current assets | 295,067  \nTotal assets | 2,390,055  \nAccounts payable | $| 41,503  \nAccounts payable-related party | 315,361  \nTax payable | 13,225  \nDue to related party-existing companies | 103,939  \nCustomer deposits | 45,074  \nAccrued expense | 135,087  \nFacility lease liability-current | 229,201  \nTotal current liabilities | 883,390  \nFacility lease liability-long term | 81,506  \nTotal liabilities | 964,896  \n  \n41  \n---  \n  \nThe following table shows the results of operations relating to discontinued operations Shuya for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nSIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  \n2024 | 2023  \nRevenues | $| - | $| 4,422,400  \nCost of goods sold | - | 4,192,172  \nGross profit | - | 230,228  \nOperating expenses  \nSelling | - | 137,606  \nGeneral and administrative | - | 17,433  \nTotal operating expenses | - | 155,039  \nIncome from operations | - | 75,189  \n-  \nOther income | - | 2,329  \nIncome before income tax | - | 77,518  \nIncome tax | - | 2,739  \nIncome before noncontrolling interest | - | 74,779  \nLess: income attributable to noncontrolling interest | - | 38,137  \nNet gain to the Company | $| - | $| 36,642  \n  \n**NOTE 16 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nNo subsequent event to report.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 2.

Prior to the first quarter of 2022 the Company had three reportable segments but added the CETY HK segment to reflect its recent new businesses in China.\n\nWe specialize in renewable energy & energy efficiency systems design, manufacturing and project implementation. We were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc. We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We provided engineering and manufacturing electronics services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of clean energy, industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products.\n\nWith the vision to combat climate change and creating a better, cleaner and environmentally sustainable future, we formed Clean Energy HRS, LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. and acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International on September 11, 2015. In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. We have 24 full-time employees.\n\nClean Energy Technologies, Inc. established a new company, CETY Europe, SRL (CETY Europe) as a wholly owned subsidiary. CETY Europe is a Sales and Service Center in Silea (Treviso), Italy established in 2017. The service center became operational in November 2018. Their offices are located at Alzaia Sul Sile, 26D, 31057 Silea (TV) and they have 1 full time employee.\n\n43  \n---  \n  \nClean Energy Technologies, Inc. established a wholly owned subsidiary called CETY Capital, a financing arm of CETY to fund captive renewable energy projects producing low carbon energy. CETY Capital will add flexibility to the capacity CETY offers its customers and fund projects utilizing its products and clean energy solutions.\n\nCETY Capital retains 49% ownership interest in Vermont Renewable Gas LLC established to develop a biomass plant in Vermont utilizing CETY’s High Temperature Ablative Pyrolysis system.\n\nClean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited., a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean Energy Technologies Inc. acquired 100% ownership of Leading Wave Limited a liquid natural gas trading company in China.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n**General**\n\nThe Company’s business and operating results are directly affected by changes in overall customer demand, operational costs and performance and leverage of our fixed cost and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) infrastructure.\n\nProduct sales fluctuate in response to several factors including many that are beyond the Company’s control, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, government regulations, consumer spending, labor availability, and our customers’ production rates and inventory levels. Product sales consist of demand from customers in many different markets with different levels of cyclicality and seasonality.\n\nOperating performance is dependent on the Company’s ability to manage changes in input costs for items such as raw materials, labor, and overhead operating costs. Performance is also affected by manufacturing efficiencies, including items such as on time delivery, quality, scrap, and productivity. Market factors of supply and demand can impact operating costs.\n\n**Who We Are**\n\nWe develop renewable energy products and solutions and establish partnerships in renewable energy that make environmental and economic sense. Our mission is to be a segment leader in the Zero Emission Revolution by offering recyclable energy solutions, clean energy fuels and alternative electric power for small and mid-sized projects in North America, Europe, and Asia. We target sustainable energy solutions that are profitable for us, profitable for our customers and represent the future of global energy production.\n\n**Our principal businesses**\n\n**Waste Heat Recovery Solutions** – we recycle wasted heat produced in manufacturing, waste to energy and power generation facilities using our patented Clean CycleTM generator to create electricity which can be recycled or sold to the grid.\n\n**Waste to Energy Solutions** - we convert waste products created in manufacturing, agriculture, wastewater treatment plants and other industries to electricity, renewable natural gas (“RNG”), hydrogen and biochar which are sold or used by our customers.\n\n**Engineering, Consulting and Project Management Solutions** – we bring a wealth of experience in developing clean energy projects for municipal and industrial customers and Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies so they can identify, design and incorporate clean energy solutions in their projects.\n\n**Clean Energy Technologies (H.K.)

NG is principally used for heavy truck refueling stations and urban or industrial users. We purchase large quantities of NG from large wholesale NG depots at fixed prices which are prepaid for in advance at a discount to the market. We sell the NG to our customers at fixed prices or prevailing daily spot prices for the duration of the contracts.\n\n44  \n---  \n  \n**Business and Segment Information**\n\nWe design, produce and market clean energy products and integrated solutions focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy. Our aim is to become a leading provider of renewable and energy efficiency products and solutions by helping commercial companies and municipalities reduce energy waste and emissions, lower energy costs and generate incremental revenue by providing electricity, renewable natural gas and biochar to the grid.\n\n**Summary of Operating Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Same Period in 2023**\n\n**Going Concern**\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a working capital of $300,071 as of June 30, 2024, The company also had an accumulated deficit of $25,429,293 as of June 30, 2024 and used $1,612,034 in net cash from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our total revenue was $1,709,151 compared to $3,274,001 for the same period in 2023. Our first half of 2024’s total revenue was lower than the same period in 2023 due to deconsolidation of our Shuya entity and substantially lower revenue from our NG business in general due to slow down of economy in China.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our gross profit was $429,035 compared to $444,018 for the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit margin was due to higher-margin business from non-NG operations.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our operating expense was $2,221,990 compared to $1,498,702 for the same period in 2023. The increase in expenses contributed to salaries expenses and professional fees for legal & accounting.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, we had a net loss of $2,251,278 compared to net loss of $1,868,163 for the same period in 2023 due to increased in salaries expense contributed to CETY Renewables new engineers and operational and technology directors, fees and marketing campaign expenses attributed to CETY’s expansion plans and loss from deconsolidation of Shuya.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, stockholder’s equity was $4,579,726, compared to $5,869,198 as of December 31, 2023. This decrease in stockholder’s equity can be attributed to net loss for the year-to-date results.\n\nCETY has successfully repositioned itself and created 4 different business segments to create a larger, more stable, and more diversified revenue stream that could scale up. The 4 segments are Clean Energy HRS (Heat Recovery), Waste-to-Energy (Pyrolysis Plant), Engineering and manufacturing services, and CETY HK (NG trading and acquisitions). Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was mainly contributed by NG trading and waste to energy project. The revenue in this segment is expected to continue to stay stable which will help establish CETY as a player in the China market and allows cross-selling of CETY products and solutions and transfer of advanced clean energy with lower cost technologies. CETY expects larger revenue contribution from Waste-to-Energy, Heat Recovery, and EPC in the latter of this year which are higher gross margin segments. Our pilot Waste-to-Energy plant in Vermont which integrates all of CETY’s technologies and expertise into a single solution, is progressing steadily with updates coming soon. There is a growing market for Heat Recovery in the U.S. and Europe, and CETY HK has begun cross-selling Heat Recovery products in China. CETY is also gearing up for the EPC segment to implement holistic self-generation solutions globally.\n\n45  \n---  \n  \nManagement believes this 4-segment strategy has created many operational synergies and cross-selling opportunities across different markets. The growth in the year ended in 2023 was a result of this strategy. CETY believes that it will continue to deliver growth on all segments this year due to our belief that there is an optimistic industry macro backdrop. The main macro factor benefiting us is the global commitment to push renewable energy to the forefront from governments across the world. This is evidenced by the Paris Agreement and COP26. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in August 2022 had specific provisions that can take advantage of CETY’s products and solutions. Another catalyst that will potentially help our Company, is a continuously improving global supply chain. The European energy crisis has given rise to the opportunity for CETY to sell more of its products and solutions as customers are in search of self-generation capabilities in renewable energy.\n\nCETY expects to and will continue to execute its corporate strategy to build sustained and profitable growth by providing end to end fully integrated solutions and technologies, expand our global sales and marketing, production, research & development, as well as search for synergistic acquisition opportunities.\n\n**See note 1 to the notes to the financial statements for a discussion on critical accounting policies**\n\n**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**See note 13 to the notes to the financial statements for a discussion on related party transaction**\n\n**Results of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024, Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023**\n\n**Net Sales**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our total revenue was $1,709,151 compared to $3,274,001 for the same period in 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to the lower revenue form the NG business and delays in funding for the Vermont Renewable Gas project, which supports the $12 million backlog.\n\n**Segment breakdown**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our revenue from Engineering and Manufacturing was $9,341 compared to $36,332 for the same period in 2023. Our engineering team is in transition to establish the innovation center in Europe and has executed a master services agreement with RPG to support its fortune 500 customers with its sustainability goals. Additionally, our engineering team will be commencing work on the Vermont project starting in the second quarter of 2023. Additionally, some of our engineering revenue is rolled up into our waste heat to power and waste to energy contracts.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our revenue from HRS was $120,874 compared to $28,338 for the same period in 2023. We have a large pipeline of opportunities in this segment and are working diligently to complete the engineering and design, enabling us to execute contractual agreements and close these opportunities. The sales cycle for these types of opportunities is long due to cost factors and the integration of the technology. We are also working with financial institutions to assist in financing the projects as we increasingly move towards Independent Power Producer models.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our revenue from our waste to energy segment was $331,487 compared to $385,404 for the same period in 2023. We have a large $12M contract with Vermont Renewable Gas in this segment and are currently finalizing the engineering and design, and permitting to start the construction. We anticipate exponentially higher revenue driven from this segment.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our revenue from our natural gas (NG) business amounted to $1,219,629, down from $2,796,649 for the corresponding period in 2023. This decrease can be attributed to the deconsolidation of Shuya’s revenue, overall substantial lower revenue from China operations due to slow down in economy and our strategic decision to prioritize non-Chinese markets over expansion into the ASEAN region.\n\n**Gross Profit**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our gross profits totaled $429,035, marking higher margins compared to $444,018 recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. This higher gross profit can be attributed to higher revenue and margins from none Chinese NG business.\n\n46  \n---  \n  \n**Segment breakdown**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our gross profit from Engineering and Manufacturing amounted to $7,806, compared to $18,355for the same period in 2023. This segment is a recent addition to CETY’s portfolio, currently serving as a support for our ongoing internal projects. Nevertheless, it is anticipated to expand notably as CETY shifts its focus towards providing comprehensive end-to-end integrated solutions.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our gross profit from HRS was $79,889, compared to $18,355 for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase in margins primarily stemmed from increased service activities, which did not include equipment sales.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our gross profit from waste to energyt was $331,487, compared to $385,404 for the corresponding period in 2023. Our waste to energy segment will be driving higher margins that our other segments.\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, our gross profit from our wholly owned subsidiary, JHJ, was $9,853, a decrease from $385,404 recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. It’s worth noting that our NG business typically operates on slim margins. Looking ahead, we intend to leverage our presence in China to foster synergistic partnerships and facilitate technology transfers, particularly in the growing EV charging sector. Additionally, we aim to explore cross-selling opportunities for our waste heat recovery and waste-to-energy products within the Chinese market.\n\n**Selling, General and Administrative (SG &A) Expenses.**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our SG&A expenses totaled $487,391, an increase from $267,062 for the same period in 2023. This increase can be attributed to increased spending in one-time JHJ misc. expense, IT, insurance expenditures particularly the D&O policy, and increased spending on repairs and maintenance, largely driven by the recent relocation of our HRS operations.\n\n**Salaries Expense**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our Salaries expense totaled $966,843, marking a significant increase from $535,237 recorded during the same period in 2023. This surge in expenses can be attributed to the inclusion of key personnel such as our CFO, director of operations, director of technology, and the recruitment of four additional engineers, and increased in work force in our NG operations. Our strategy involves fortifying our team from the ground up to establish a robust foundation for scalable growth, reinforced by cutting-edge technology and streamlined systems. We hold strong conviction in the capabilities of our assembled team, envisioning their collective efforts leading us to a position of leadership within the clean energy sector.\n\n**Travel Expense**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our travel expense was $81,224 compared to $200,139 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to lower travel expenses related to China NG business development.\n\n**Professional fees legal and accounting**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our Professional Fees expense totaled $353,065, marking an increase from $177,437 in the corresponding period of 2023. This rise in accounting fees can be attributed directly to engaging a new audit firm, which incurred higher costs.\n\n**Facility Lease and Maintenance Expense**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our Facility Lease and maintenance expenses totaled $150,883, marking a significant decrease from the $126,766 incurred during the same period in 2023. This increase in cost can be attributed to the NG operations increased in rent.\n\n**Depreciation and Amortization Expense**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our depreciation and amortization expense was $5,938 compared to $6,454 for the same period in 2023.\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n**Change in Derivative Liability**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, we had [no] derivative liability compared to a gain of $326,539 for the same period in 2023. The gain in derivative liability was from a favorable derivative calculation from several convertible notes in the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\n**Interest and Finance Fees**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, interest and finance fees amounted to $422,863, as opposed to $1,349,594 for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in interest and fees can be attributed to less number of notes and bridge financing aimed at facilitating the uplisting to Nasdaq. Despite the decrease in interest and fees for the June 30, 2024 period, we believe that the cost of capital for CETY remains elevated. The delay in securing affordable financing for our Vermont project resulted in our reliance on high-cost financing options. We are working diligently to finalize our financing in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Net Loss**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, our loss amounted to $2,251,278, representing an increase from the loss of $1,868,163 incurred during the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is attributed to expenditures in salaries, IT, relocation, and legal and professional fees.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n**Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.**\n\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\nfor the six months ended June 30,\n\n(unaudited)\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nNet cash (used in) operating activities | $| (1,612,034| ) | $| (2,620,809| )  \nNet cash provided by investing activities | 83,160 | 14,319  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | 1,828,380 | 3,159,324  \nForeign Currency Transaction | (1,188| ) | -  \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents | $| 298,318 | $| 583,899  \n  \n**Capital Requirements for Long-Term Obligations**\n\nNone.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies**\n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\n\n48  \n---  \n  \nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, _“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”_ (“ASC 606”).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10_\n\nAn entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\na. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).\n\nb. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).\n\nc. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our business:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \n_Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-30_\n\nIf a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\n\nb. The customer has legal title to the asset\n\nc. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\n\nd. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\n\ne. The customer has accepted the asset\n\n49  \n---  \n  \nThe core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and CETY Europe Divisions:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \nThe following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:\n\n● | We generate a quotation  \n---|---  \n● | We receive Purchase orders from our customers.  \n● | We build the product to their specification  \n● | We invoice at the time of shipment  \n● | The terms are typically Net 30 days  \n  \nThe following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:\n\n● | CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service.   \n---|---  \n  \n_A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):_\n\na. | A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer to the customer may not qualify.  \n---|---  \nb. | A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.  \nc. | A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer.  \n  \nIf the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.\n\nDuring the project development and engineering phase of our CETY Renewable projects such as VRG, we employ the input method of revenue recognition to estimate revenue based on projected costs. This approach involves forecasting future costs and revenues to determine the amount of revenue we recognize in the current period. It’s important to understand, however, that these recognized revenue figures are not final and are subject to adjustments. Changes may occur as we gain more clarity on actual costs compared to our initial projections, affecting the revenue recognized accordingly.\n\n50  \n---  \n  \nThe projected costs of the VRG project is based on estimates and profitability will be impacted depending on actual costs. Using the input method for revenue recognition, the amount of recorded revenue is also affected depending on the estimated total costs. The purchase price allocation for Shuya was also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company. The inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company.\n\nAdditionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:\n\nBecause the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.\n\nIn recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.\n\n● | The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n● | CETY and customer agree to a total EPC Contract price.  \n● | The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.  \n● | Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.  \n  \nSecondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with the its agreement with its clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.\n\nCETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.\n\nCETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There are no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.\n\nIn review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.\n\nIn reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.\n\nFinally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.\n\n51  \n---  \n  \nFor CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nDuring the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.\n\nWe have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.\n\nAlso, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $33,000 and $33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter of year 2024.\n\nAlso from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of June 30,2024, and December 31, 2023, we had outstanding customer deposits of $41,462 and $210,310 respectively.\n\n**Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation**\n\nChengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (the “Xiangyueheng”), which owns a 10% equity interest in Shuya, entered a three-party Concerted Action Agreement (the “CAA”), wherein the parties agreed to vote in unison at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agreed that during the term of the CAA, before any of the three parties intends to propose motions to the shareholders’ meetings or the board of directors, or exercise their voting rights on any matter that shall be presented to and resolved through the shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the laws, regulations, Articles of Association of Shuya or any relevant shareholders’ agreements, the three parties will discuss, negotiate, and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.\n\nAs a result of the CAA, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (the “VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nOn January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n52  \n---  \n  \n**Series E Valuation**\n\nAdditionally, the inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company and fair value measurements, furthermore, the purchase price allocation was based on estimates of fair market values.\n\n**Future Financing**\n\nWe will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.\n\n**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**\n\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.\n\n**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.\n\n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures.**\n\n**_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_**\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024, for a complete discussion relating to the foregoing evaluation of Disclosures and Procedures.\n\n**_Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**\n\nOur management has also evaluated our internal control over financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes during the six months ended June 30, 2024 in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of our last evaluation.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \n**PART II—OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. The Company is presently not involved in any legal proceedings which in the opinion of management are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors.**\n\nThere have been no material changes in the Company’s risk factors from those previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on June 20, 2024.\n\n**Item 2.

All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\n\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s fiscal year end December 31, 2023 report. The Company assumes that the users of the interim financial information herein have read, or have access to, the audited financial statements for the preceding period, and that the adequacy of additional disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that context. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nThe summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.\n\n**Corporate History**\n\nWe were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc. We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We manufactured electronics and provided services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products. On September 11, 2015 Clean Energy HRS, or “CE HRS”, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International. In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1340 Reynolds Avenue, Irvine, CA 92614. Our telephone number is (949) 273-4990. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CETY.”\n\nOur internet website address is www.cetyinc.com. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this document, and you should not consider any information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website as part of this document.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy HRS (HRS) & CETY Europe, CETY Renewables waste to energy, and engineering & manufacturing services, and CETY HK NG trading.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**Going Concern**\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder’s equity of $4,414,986 and a working capital of $324,893 as of March 31, 2024. The company also had an accumulated deficit of $24,473,587 as of March 31, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.\n\n**Plan of Operation**\n\nCETY is a rising leader in the zero-emission revolution by providing eco-friendly energy solutions, clean energy fuels, and alternative electric power for small to mid-sized projects across North America, Europe, and Asia. The company harnesses the power of heat and biomass to produce electricity with zero emissions and minimal cost. Additionally, the company offers Waste to Energy Solutions, converting waste materials from manufacturing, agriculture, and wastewater treatment plants into electricity and BioChar. Clean Energy Technologies also provides Engineering, Consulting, and Project Management Solutions, leveraging its expertise to develop clean energy projects for both municipal and industrial customers, as well as Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) companies.\n\n**Our principal businesses**\n\n**Heat Recovery Solutions** – Clean Energy Technologies patented Clean Cycle Generator (CCG) is a heat recovery system that captures waste heat from various sources and converts it into electricity. This system can be integrated into various industrial processes, helping to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions.\n\n**Waste to Energy Solutions** - Clean Energy Technologies’ waste to energy solutions involve converting organic waste materials, such as agricultural waste and food waste, into clean energy through its proprietary gasification technology that produce a range of products, including electricity, heat, and biochar.\n\n**Engineering, Consulting and Project Management Solutions** – Clean Energy Technologies offers engineering and manufacturing services to help clients bring their sustainable energy products to market. This includes design, prototyping, testing, and production services. Clean Energy Technologies’ expertise in engineering and manufacturing enables it to provide customized solutions to meet clients’ specific needs.\n\n**Clean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited (“CETY HK”)** consists of two business ventures in mainland China:(i) our natural gas (“NG”) trading operations sourcing and suppling NG to industries and municipalities. NG is principally used for heavy truck refueling stations and urban or industrial users. We purchase large quantities of NG from large wholesale NG depots at fixed prices which are prepaid for in advance at a discount to the market. We sell the NG to our customers at fixed prices or prevailing daily spot prices for the duration of the contracts\n\n**NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:**\n\nThe summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (formerly Probe Manufacturing, Inc.) is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**Use of Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates may be materially different from actual financial results. Significant estimates include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the collection of accounts receivable and valuation of inventory and reserves.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nWe maintain the majority of our cash accounts at JP Morgan Chase bank. The total cash balance is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000, (which we may exceed from time to time) per commercial bank. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows we consider all cash and highly liquid investments with initial maturities of one year or less to be cash equivalents.\n\n**Accounts Receivable**\n\nOur ability to collect receivables is affected by economic fluctuations in the geographic areas and industries served by us. Reserves for un-collectable amounts are provided, based on past experience and a specific analysis of the accounts. Although we expect to collect amounts due, actual collections may differ from the estimated amounts. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable accounts receivable of $95,000. Our policy for reserves for our long-term financing receivables is determined on a contract-by-contract basis and considers the length of the financing arrangement. As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable long-term financing receivables of $247,500.\n\nEight customers accounted for approximately 98% of accounts receivable on March 31, 2024. Our trade accounts primarily represent unsecured receivables. Historically, our bad debt write-offs related to these trade accounts have been insignificant.\n\n**Inventory**\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market value. Our industry experiences changes in technology, changes in market value and availability of raw materials, as well as changing customer demand. We make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventories based on regular audits and cycle counts of our on-hand inventory levels and forecasted customer demands and at times additional provisions are made. Any inventory write offs are charged to the reserve account. As of March 31, 2024 we had a reserve of $934,344 as compared to a reserve of $934,344 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**Property and Equipment**\n\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Assets held under capital leases are recorded at lease inception at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets. The cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES\n\nFurniture and fixtures | 3 to 5 years  \n---|---  \n  \n10  \n---  \n  \n**Long – Lived Assets**\n\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nRecoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, _“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”_ (“ASC 606”).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10_\n\nAn entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\na. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).\n\nb. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).\n\nc. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n_Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-30_\n\nIf a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\n\nb. The customer has legal title to the asset\n\nc. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\n\nd. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\n\ne. The customer has accepted the asset\n\nThe core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition, a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \nThe following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:\n\n● | We generate a quotation  \n---|---  \n● | We receive Purchase orders from our customers.  \n● | We build the product to their specification  \n● | We invoice at the time of shipment  \n● | The terms are typically Net 30 days  \n  \nThe following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:\n\n● | CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service.   \n---|---  \n  \n_A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):_\n\na. | A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer to the customer may not qualify.  \n---|---  \nb. | A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.  \nc. | A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer.  \n  \nIf the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \nAdditionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:\n\nBecause the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.\n\nIn recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.\n\n● | The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY and customer agree to a total EPC contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.  \n---|---  \n  \nSecondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with its agreement with clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.\n\nCETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.\n\nCETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There is no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.\n\nIn review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.\n\nIn reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.\n\nFinally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.\n\nFor CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nDuring the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.\n\nWe have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.\n\nAlso, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31,2024 we had $33,000 and 33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of year 2024.\n\nAlso from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of March 31,2024, and December 31, 2023 and, we had outstanding customer deposits of $119,121 and $165,236 respectively.\n\n**Fair Value of Financial Instruments**\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 820-10 (SFAS No. 157), “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:\n\n● | Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  \n---|---  \n● | Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.  \n● | Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s derivative liabilities have been valued as Level 3 instruments. We value the derivative liability using a lattice model, with a volatility of 56% and using a risk free interest rate of 0.15%  \n  \nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and convertible notes payable. The estimated fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses and convertible notes payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n**Foreign Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)**\n\nWe have no material components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods. The accounts of the Company’s Chinese entities are maintained in RMB. The accounts of the Chinese entities were translated into USD in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters.” All assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; stockholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income.” Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the statements of operations.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 220-10, “Comprehensive Income (loss).” Comprehensive income (loss) comprises net income (loss) and all changes to the statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in additional paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders.\n\n**Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation**\n\nIn July 2022, JHJ and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHK owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022, JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya.\n\nShuya was set up as the operating entity for pipeline natural gas (PNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) trading business, while the other two shareholders of Shuaya have large supply relationships.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that Shuya was not a VIE and has evaluated its consolidation analysis under the voting interest model. Because the Company does not own greater than 50% of the outstanding voting shares, either directly or indirectly, it has accounted for its investment in Shuya under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investor (“JHJ”) recognizes its share of the profits and losses of the investee (“Shuya”) in the periods when these profits and losses are also reflected in the accounts of the investee. Any profit or loss recognized by the investing entity appears in its income statement. Also, any recognized profit increases the investment recorded by the investing entity, while a recognized loss decreases the investment.\n\nJHJ made a investment of RMB 3.91 million ($0.55 million) into Shuya during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 recorded in accordance with ASC 323. Shuya had a net loss of approximately $10,750 during the year ending December 31, 2022, of which approximately $5,000 was allocated to the company, reducing the investment by that amount.\n\nHowever, effective January 1, 2023, JHJ, SSEN and Chengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (“Xiangyueheng), who is the 10% shareholder of Shuya, entered a Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, wherein these three shareholders (or three parties) will guarantee that the voting rights will be expressed in the same way at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agree that within the validity period of this agreement, before the party intends to propose the motions to the shareholders or the board of directors on the major matters related to the voting rights of the shareholders or the board of directors, the three parties internally will discuss, negotiate and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.\n\nAs a result of Consistent Action Agreement, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (“VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nThe change of control interest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, referred to as ASC, 805, Business Combinations. The management determined that the Company was the acquiror for financial accounting purposes. In identifying the Company as the accounting acquiror, the companies considered the structure of the transaction and other actions contemplated by the Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, relative outstanding share ownership and market values, the composition of the combined company’s board of directors, the relative size of Shuya, and the designation of certain senior management positions of the combined company.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 805, the Company recorded the acquisition based on the fair value of the consideration transferred and then allocated the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of the value of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair value of those net assets was recorded as goodwill. Any identified definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives and any identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The valuation of purchase considerations was based on preliminary estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. \n\nAs the Consistent Action Agreement did not quantify any considerations to gain the control, the deemed consideration paid is the fair value of 51% non-controlling interest as of January 1, 2023. The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on January 1, 2023, the acquisition date.\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED\n\nFair value of non-controlling interests | $| 650,951  \n---|---|---  \nFair value of previously held equity investment | 556,096  \nSubtotal | $| 1,207,047  \nRecognized value of 100% of identifiable net assets | (1,207,047| )  \nGoodwill Recognized | $| -  \nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (preliminary):  \nInventories | $| 516,131  \nCash and cash equivalents | 50,346  \nTrade and other receivables | 952,384  \nAdvanced deposit | 672,597  \nNet fixed assets | 6,704  \nTrade and other payables | (1,021,897| )  \nAdvanced payments | (5,317| )  \nSalaries and wages payables | (4,692| )  \nOther receivable | 40,791  \nTotal identifiable net assets | $| 1,207,047  \n  \nUnder ASC-805-10-50-2, initial consolidation of an investee previously reported using fair value or the equity method should be accounted for prospectively as of the date the entity obtained a controlling financial interest. Therefore, the Company should provide pro forma information as if the consolidation had occurred as of the beginning of each of the current and prior comparative reporting period per\n\nOn January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**Net (Loss) per Common Share**\n\nBasic (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. At March 31, 2024, we had outstanding common shares of 40,143,893. Basic Weighted average common shares and equivalents for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 were 42,550,948 and 37,255,674 respectively. As of March 31, 2024, we had convertible notes, convertible into approximately 2,659,288 of additional common shares and outstanding warrants of 2,099,352 shares. Fully diluted weighted average common shares and equivalents were withheld from the calculation for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 as they were considered anti-dilutive.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nWe had no amounts of research and development (R&D) expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023.\n\n**Segment Disclosure**\n\nFASB Codification Topic 280, _Segment Reporting_ , establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about an enterprise’s reportable segments. The Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy HRS (HRS), CETY Europe, CETY HK and engineering & manufacturing services division. The segments are determined based on several factors, including the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, customer base, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics. Refer to note 1 for a description of the various product categories manufactured under each of these segments.\n\nAn operating segment’s performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net sales less cost of sales, and segment selling, general and administrative expenses, and does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, other charges (income), net and interest and other, net.\n\n**Selected Financial Data** :\n\nSCHEDULE OF FINANCIAL DATA\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nFor the three months ended March 31,  \n2024 | 2023  \nNet Sales  \nManufacturing and Engineering | $| 9,341 | $| -  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 72,488 | 10,942  \nNG Trading | 1,219,629 | 540,927  \nWaste to Energy | 211,568 | -  \nDiscontinued operations | - | 2,345,138  \nTotal Sales | $| 1,513,026 | $| 2,897,007  \nSegment income and reconciliation before tax  \nManufacturing and Engineering | 7,806 | -  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 51,599 | 5,127  \nLNG Trading | 9,852 | 14,360  \nWaste to Energy | 183,748 | -  \nTotal Segment income | 253,005 | 19,487  \nLess: operating expense | (1,073,926| ) | (698,107| )  \nLess: other income and expenses | (295,193| ) | (431,770| )  \nNet (loss) before income tax | $| (1,116,114| ) | $| (1,110,390| )  \nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nTotal Assets  \nManufacturing and Engineering | $| 2,528,055 | $| 2,544,786  \nHeat Recovery Solutions | 3,167,896 | 3,099,223  \nWaste to Energy | 690,435 | 486,572  \nNG Trading | 2,946,189 | 4,798,030  \nTotal Assets | $| 9,332,575 | $| 10,928,611  \n2023 | 2023  \n---|---  \nFor the three months ended March 31,  \n2024 | 2023  \nUnited States | 286,311 | 5,194  \nChina | 1,219,629 | 540,927  \nOther international | 7,086 | 5,748  \nTotal Sales | 1,513,026 | 551,869  \n  \n15  \n---  \n  \n**Share-Based Compensation**\n\nThe Company has adopted the use of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123R) (now contained in FASB Codification Topic 718, _Compensation-Stock Compensation_), which supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and its related implementation guidance and eliminates the alternative to use Opinion 25’s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement 123 as originally issued. This Statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instruments, which includes grants of stock options and stock warrants, based on the fair value of the award, measured at the grant date (with limited exceptions). Under this standard, the fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date, using an option-pricing model that meets certain requirements. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards, including stock options and warrants. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of SFAS No. 123R; however, the fair values generated may not reflect their actual fair values, as it does not consider certain factors, such as vesting requirements, employee attrition and transferability limitations. The Black-Scholes model valuation is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected volatility and estimated life of our stock options at grant date based on historical volatility. For the “risk-free interest rate,” we use the Constant Maturity Treasury rate on 90-day government securities. The term is equal to the time until the option expires. The dividend yield is not applicable, as the Company has not paid any dividends, nor do we anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. The fair value of our restricted stock is based on the market value of our free trading common stock, on the grant date calculated using a 20-trading-day average. At the time of grant, the share-based compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest using historical employee attrition rates and the expense is reduced accordingly. It is also adjusted to account for the restricted and thinly traded nature of the shares. The expense is reviewed and adjusted in subsequent periods if actual attrition differs from those estimates.\n\nWe re-evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on a quarterly basis and, if changes warrant different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount expensed in the past. We may be required to adjust any remaining share-based compensation expense, based on any additions, cancellations or adjustments to the share-based awards. The expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. \n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**Leases**\n\nThe Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, or ASC 842, using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment to be accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019, and accordingly, modified its policy on accounting for leases as stated below. As described under “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements,” below, the primary impact of adopting ASC 842 for the Company was the recognition in the consolidated balance sheet of certain lease-related assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms longer than 12 months.\n\nThe Company’s leases primarily consist of facility leases which are classified as operating leases. The Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company recognizes a lease liability to make contractual payments under all leases with terms greater than twelve months and a corresponding right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term using the collateralized incremental borrowing rate since the implicit rate is unknown. Options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such an option. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the contractual lease liability plus any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made, less any lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLeased right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing as a long-lived asset at the asset-group level. The Company monitors its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. As the Company’s leased right-of-use assets primarily relate to facility leases, early abandonment of all or part of facility as part of a restructuring plan is typically an indicator of impairment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company tests whether the carrying amount of the leased right-of-use asset is recoverable including consideration of sublease income, and if not recoverable, measures impairment loss for the right-of-use asset or asset group.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nFederal Income taxes are not currently due since we have had losses since inception of Clean Energy Technologies.\n\nOn December 22, 2018 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (“Federal Tax Rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company will compute its income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 using a Federal Tax Rate of 21% and an estimated state of California rate of 9%.\n\nIncome taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 _Income Taxes – Recognition._ Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than not” standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5.\n\nDeferred income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $(8,275,877) and a deferred tax asset of $2,482,763 using the statutory rate of 30%. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked a valuation allowance of $(2,482,763). FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. On March 31, 2024 the Company did not take any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740.\n\nOn February 13, 2018, Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Registrant” or “Corporation”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (“Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and between MGW Investment I Limited (“MGWI”) and the Corporation. The Corporation received $907,388 in exchange for the issuance of 302,462,667 restricted shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Common Stock”).\n\nOn February 13, 2018, the Corporation and Confections Ventures Limited. (“CVL”) entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Convertible Note Purchase Agreement,” together with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder, the “Financing”) pursuant to which the Corporation issued to CVL a convertible promissory Note (the “CVL Note”) in the principal amount of $939,500 with an interest rate of 10% per annum interest rate and a maturity date of February 13, 2020. The CVL Note is convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.12 per share, as adjusted as provided therein. This note was assigned to MGW Investments.\n\nThis resulted in a change in control, which limited the net operating to that date forward. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and the states of California. Further, the Company currently has no open tax years’ subject to audit prior to December 31, 2015. The Company is current on its federal and state tax returns.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n**Reclassification**\n\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported income, total assets, or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**\n\n**Deferred Stock Issuance Costs**\n\nDeferred stock issuance costs represent amounts paid for legal, consulting, and other offering expenses in conjunction with the future raising of additional capital to be performed within one year. These costs are netted against additional paid-in capital as a cost of the stock issuance upon closing of the respective stock placement. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024 no stock issuance costs were capitalized.\n\n**NOTE 3 – ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE**\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nAccounts Receivable | $| 1,221,528 | 1,197,386  \nAccounts Receivable Related Party | 660,464 | 491,774  \nLess reserve for uncollectable accounts | (95,000| ) | (95,000| )  \nTotal | $| 1,786,992 | 1,594,160  \n  \nOur Accounts Receivable is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\nSCHEDULE OF LEASE RECEIVABLE ASSET\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nLong-term financing receivables | $| 1,149,854 | $| 1,149,854  \nLess Reserve for uncollectable accounts | (247,500| ) | (247,500| )  \nLong-term financing receivables - net | $| 902,354 | $| 902,354  \n  \nThe Company is currently modifying the assets subject to lease to meet the provisions of the agreement, and as of March 31, 2024 any collection on the lease payments was not yet considered probable, resulting in no derecognition of the underlying asset and no net lease investments recognized on the sales-type lease pursuant to ASC 842-30-25-3.\n\nOn a contract by contract basis or projects that require extensive work from multiple contractors or supply chain challenges or in response to certain situations or installation difficulties, the Company may elect to allow non-interest bearing repayments in excess of 1 year.\n\nOur long - term financing Receivable are pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 4 – INVENTORIES, NET**\n\nInventories by major classification were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INVENTORIES\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nInventory | $| 1,590,881 | 1,600,757  \nLess reserve for uncollectable accounts | (934,344| ) | (934,344| )  \nTotal | $| 656,537 | 666,413  \n  \nOur Inventory is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 5 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nProperty and equipment were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nProperty and Equipment | $| 1,434,792 | 1,430,076  \nAccumulated Depreciation | (1,430,588| ) | (1,425,546| )  \nNet Fixed Assets | $| 4,204 | 4,530  \n  \nOur Depreciation Expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 was zero and $5,949 respectively.\n\nOur Property Plant and Equipment is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\nIntangible assets were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nMarch 31, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nGoodwill | $| 747,976 | 747,976  \nLWL Intangibles | 1,468,709 | 1,468,709  \nIntangible assets - Shuya | - | 12,914  \nLicense | 354,322 | 354,322  \nPatents | 190,789 | 190,789  \nAccumulated Amortization | (101,941| ) | (98,972| )  \nNet Intangible Assets | $| 2,659,855 | 2,675,738  \n  \nOur Amortization Expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $2,969 and 2,969 respectively.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nBased on the foregoing analysis of the facts surrounding the Company’s acquisition of LWL, it is the Company’s position that the Company is the acquirer of LWL, under the acquisition method of accounting.\n\nAs such, as of November 8, 2021 (the acquisition date), the Company recognized, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the Business combination.\n\nThe following table presents the purchase price allocation:\n\nSCHEDULE OF BUSINESS ACQUISITION PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION\n\nConsideration:  \n---  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 1,500,000  \nTotal purchaser consideration | $| 1,500,000  \nAssets acquired:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 6,156  \nPrepayment | $| 13,496  \nOther receivable | $| 20,000  \nTrading Contracts | $| 146,035  \nShenzhen Gas Relationship | $| 1,314,313  \nTotal assets acquired | $| 1,508,539  \nLiabilities assumed:  \nAdvance Receipts | $| (8539  \nTaxes Payable | $| 179  \nNet Assets Acquired: | $| 1,500,000  \n  \nIf LWL reach USD 5 million in revenue or net profit of USD 1 million by December 31, 2023, then based on the performance contingency there will be issuance of 500,000 shares of CETY to the Seller.

For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but has been updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted the above ASU as of January 1, 2019. The right of use asset and lease liability have been recorded at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, utilizing a 5% average borrowing rate and the company is utilizing the transition relief and “running off” on current leases.\n\nAs of May 1, 2017, our corporate headquarters were located at 2990 Redhill Unit A, Costa Mesa, CA.

Based upon the terms of the members’ agreement, the CETY Capital LLC owned 75% interest and AG owns a 25% interest in Ashfield Renewables Ag Development LLC. The agreement with CETY Renewables Ashfield has been terminated and CETY Renewable Ashfield was dissolved.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have deconsolidated the CRA business unit. The Liabilities of CRA has been transferred to Vermont Renewable Gas LLC (“VRG”), a newly formed entity. CETY retains 49% equity in VRG.\n\nOn April 2, 2023 the Company formed CETY Capital LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of CETY. In addition, the company established Vermont Renewable Gas LLC (“VRG”) with our partner, Synergy Bioproducts Corporation (“SBC”) The purpose of the joint venture is the development of a pyrolysis plant established to convert wood feedstock into electricity and BioChar by using high temperature ablative fast pyrolysis reactor for which Clean Energy Technology, Inc. holds the license for. The VRG is in Lyndon, Vermont. Based upon the terms of the members’ agreement, CETY Capital LLC owns a 49% interest and SBC owns a 51% interest in Vermont Renewable Gas LLC.\n\nThe Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 49/51 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of 3 members. Two of the three members are from Synergy Bioproducts Corporation, and one is from CETY. Both parties do not have substantial capital at risk and CETY does not have voting interest. However, SBC has controlling interest and more board votes therefore SBC is the beneficiary of the VIE and as a result we record it as an equity investment. Accordingly, the Company has elected to account for the joint venture as an equity method investment in accordance with ASC 323 Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This decision is a result of the company’s evaluation of its involvement with potential variable interest entities and their respective risk and reward scenarios, which collectively affirm that the conditions necessitating the application of the variable interest model are not present.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \nIn July 2022 JHJ and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHJ owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022 JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya. As a result of Consistent Action Agreement entered on December 31, 2022 the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (“VIE”) of JHJ, and the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023. The non-controlling interest of Shuya represents the 41% equity ownership that is owned by Leishen, and 10% equity ownership owned by another shareholder.\n\nOn January 1, 2024 and effective on the same date., JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties release each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company has determined that Shuya no longer constitutes a VIE and the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n**NOTE 16 – DECONSOLIDATION OF SUBSIDIARY**\n\nOn January 1, 2024 and effective on the same date., JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties release each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company has determined that Shuya no longer constitutes a VIE and the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024. Accordingly, started from January 1, 2024, the Company deconsolidated Shuya. Under ASC 810-10-40-5, deconsolidation of a VIE generally results in recognition of a gain or loss in the income statement. In addition, any retained equity interest or investment in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value as of the date of deconsolidation. The consideration for deconsolidating of Shuya is $0, the Company used discounted cash flow method to evaluate the fair value of Shuya, and determined the fair value of retained equity interest for Shuya and NCI approximate its carry value; therefore, no gain or loss was recognized from deconsolidation of Shuya.\n\nThe Company recalculated the fair value of Shuya investment as of January 1, 2024 using the income approach at $399,993 and recorded a loss of $303,286 from deconsolidation of Shuya for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of Shuya at December 31, 2023.\n\nSCHEDULE OF CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nCash | $| 85,226  \n---|---|---  \nAccounts receivable | 164,744  \nAdvance to Supplier-Prepayment | 317,557  \nAdvance to Supplier-Related Party | 463,621  \nDue from related party | 752,066  \nInventory | 308,481  \nTotal current assets | 2,091,695  \nFixed assets, net | 74,158  \nIntangible assets, net | 12,914  \nRight of use asset | 207,995  \nTotal non-current assets | 295,067  \nTotal assets | 2,386,762  \nAccounts payable | $| 41,503  \nAccounts payable-related party | 328,587  \nCustomer Deposits | 45,074  \nAccrued Expense | 135,087  \nFacility Lease liability-current | 229,201  \nTotal current liabilities | 779,452  \nFacility Lease liability-long term | 81,506  \nTotal liabilities | 860,958  \n  \n36  \n---  \n  \nThe following table shows the results of operations relating to discontinued operations Shuya for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nTHREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  \n2024 | 2023  \nRevenues | $| - | $| 2,345,138  \nCost of goods sold | - | 2,204,056  \nGross profit | - | 141,082  \nOperating expenses  \nSelling | - | 59,680  \nGeneral and administrative | - | 5,624  \nTotal operating expenses | - | 65,304  \nIncome from operations | - | 75,778  \n- | -  \nOther income | - | 72  \nIncome before income tax | - | 75,850  \nIncome tax | - | (1,295| )  \nIncome before noncontrolling interest | - | 74,555  \nLess: income attributable to noncontrolling interest | - | 38,023  \nNet gain to the Company | $| - | $| 36,532  \n  \n**NOTE 17 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nAs of the day of May 20, 2024, the Company issued 378,800 shares for conversion of Series E Preferred share valued at $400,521.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 2.

Prior to the first quarter of 2022 the Company had three reportable segments but added the CETY HK segment to reflect its recent new businesses in China.\n\n38  \n---  \n  \nWe specialize in renewable energy & energy efficiency systems design, manufacturing and project implementation. We were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc. We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We provided engineering and manufacturing electronics services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of clean energy, industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products.\n\nWith the vision to combat climate change and creating a better, cleaner and environmentally sustainable future, we formed Clean Energy HRS, LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. and acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International on September 11, 2015. In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. We have 24 full-time employees.\n\nClean Energy Technologies, Inc. established a new company, CETY Europe, SRL (CETY Europe) as a wholly owned subsidiary. CETY Europe is a Sales and Service Center in Silea (Treviso), Italy established in 2017. The service center became operational in November 2018. Their offices are located at Alzaia Sul Sile, 26D, 31057 Silea (TV) and they have 1 full time employee.\n\nClean Energy Technologies, Inc. established a wholly owned subsidiary called CETY Capital, a financing arm of CETY to fund captive renewable energy projects producing low carbon energy. CETY Capital will add flexibility to the capacity CETY offers its customers and fund projects utilizing its products and clean energy solutions.\n\nCETY Capital retains 49% ownership interest in Vermont Renewable Gas LLC established to develop a biomass plant in Vermont utilizing CETY’s High Temperature Ablative Pyrolysis system.\n\nClean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited., a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean Energy Technologies Inc. acquired 100% ownership of Leading Wave Limited a liquid natural gas trading company in China.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\n**General**\n\nThe Company’s business and operating results are directly affected by changes in overall customer demand, operational costs and performance and leverage of our fixed cost and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) infrastructure.\n\nProduct sales fluctuate in response to several factors including many that are beyond the Company’s control, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, government regulations, consumer spending, labor availability, and our customers’ production rates and inventory levels. Product sales consist of demand from customers in many different markets with different levels of cyclicality and seasonality.\n\nOperating performance is dependent on the Company’s ability to manage changes in input costs for items such as raw materials, labor, and overhead operating costs. Performance is also affected by manufacturing efficiencies, including items such as on time delivery, quality, scrap, and productivity. Market factors of supply and demand can impact operating costs.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \n**Who We Are**\n\nWe develop renewable energy products and solutions and establish partnerships in renewable energy that make environmental and economic sense. Our mission is to be a segment leader in the Zero Emission Revolution by offering recyclable energy solutions, clean energy fuels and alternative electric power for small and mid-sized projects in North America, Europe, and Asia. We target sustainable energy solutions that are profitable for us, profitable for our customers and represent the future of global energy production.\n\n**Our principal businesses**\n\n**Waste Heat Recovery Solutions** – we recycle wasted heat produced in manufacturing, waste to energy and power generation facilities using our patented Clean CycleTM generator to create electricity which can be recycled or sold to the grid.\n\n**Waste to Energy Solutions** - we convert waste products created in manufacturing, agriculture, wastewater treatment plants and other industries to electricity, renewable natural gas (“RNG”), hydrogen and biochar which are sold or used by our customers.\n\n**Engineering, Consulting and Project Management Solutions** – we bring a wealth of experience in developing clean energy projects for municipal and industrial customers and Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies so they can identify, design and incorporate clean energy solutions in their projects.\n\n**CETY HK**\n\nClean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited (“CETY HK”) consists of two business ventures in mainland China:(i) our natural gas (“NG”) trading operations sourcing and suppling NG to industries and municipalities. Natural Gas is principally used for heavy truck refueling stations and urban or industrial users. We purchase large quantities of NG from large wholesale NG depots at fixed prices which are prepaid for in advance at a discount to the market. We sell the NG to our customers at fixed prices or prevailing daily spot prices for the duration of the contracts.\n\n**Business and Segment Information**\n\nWe design, produce and market clean energy products and integrated solutions focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy. Our aim is to become a leading provider of renewable and energy efficiency products and solutions by helping commercial companies and municipalities reduce energy waste and emissions, lower energy costs and generate incremental revenue by providing electricity, renewable natural gas and biochar to the grid.\n\n**Summary of Operating Results the three months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to the same period in 2023**\n\n**Going Concern**\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder’s equity of $4,414,986 and a working capital of $324,893 as of March 31, 2024, The company also had an accumulated deficit of $24,473,587 as of March 31, 2024 and used $871,636 in net cash from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve its goals and reach profitable operations and is still dependent upon its ability (1) to obtain sufficient debt and/or equity capital and/or (2) to generate positive cash flow from operations.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our total revenue was $1,513,026 compared to $551,869 for the same period in 2023. Our first quarter 2024 total revenue was higher than the same period in 2023 due to deconsolidation of our Shuya entity.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our gross profit was $253,005 compared to $19,487 for the same period in 2023. The higher gross profit margins were a result of increased revenue from CETY’s non-NG business in China.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, our operating expense was $1,073,926 compared to $698,107 for the same period in 2023. The increase in expenses contributed to salaries expenses and professional fees for legal & accounting.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, we had a net loss of $1,419,400 compared to $1,110,390 for the same period in 2023 due to increased in salaries expense contributed to CETY Renewables new engineers and operational and technology directors, fees and marketing campaign expenses attributed to CETY’s expansion plans and loss from deconsolidation of Shuya.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, stockholder’s equity was $4,414,986, compared to $5,869,198 as of December 31, 2023. This decrease of $1,454,212 in stockholder’s equity can be attributed to net loss for the quarter.\n\nCETY has successfully repositioned itself and created 4 different business segments to create a larger, more stable, and more diversified revenue stream that could scale up. The 4 segments are Clean Energy HRS (Heat Recovery), Waste-to-Energy (Pyrolysis Plant), Engineering Procurement and Consulting (EPC), and CETY HK (NG trading and acquisitions). First quarter revenue was mainly contributed by NG trading. The revenue in this segment is expected to continue to stay stable which will help establish CETY as a player in the China market and allows cross-selling of CETY products and solutions and transfer of advanced clean energy with lower cost technologies. CETY expects larger revenue contribution from Waste-to-Energy, Heat Recovery, and EPC in the latter of this year which are higher gross margin segments. Our pilot Waste-to-Energy plant in Vermont which integrates all of CETY’s technologies and expertise into a single solution, is progressing steadily with updates coming soon. There is a growing market for Heat Recovery in the U.S. and Europe, and CETY HK has begun cross-selling Heat Recovery products in China. CETY is also gearing up for the EPC segment to implement holistic self-generation solutions globally.\n\nManagement believes this 4-segment strategy has created many operational synergies and cross-selling opportunities across different markets. The growth in the year ended 2024 vs. 2023 was a result of this strategy. CETY believes that it will continue to deliver growth on all segments this year due to our belief that there is an optimistic industry macro backdrop. The main macro factor benefiting us is the global commitment to push renewable energy to the forefront from governments across the world. This is evidenced by the Paris Agreement and COP26. The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in August 2022 had specific provisions that can take advantage of CETY’s products and solutions. Another catalyst that will potentially help our Company, is a continuously improving global supply chain. The European energy crisis has given rise to the opportunity for CETY to sell more of its products and solutions as customers are in search of self-generation capabilities in renewable energy.\n\nCETY expects to and will continue to execute its corporate strategy to build sustained and profitable growth by providing end to end fully integrated solutions and technologies, expand our global sales and marketing, production, research & development, as well as search for synergistic acquisition opportunities.\n\n**See note 1 to the notes to the financial statements for a discussion on critical accounting policies**\n\n41  \n---  \n  \n**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**See note 13 to the notes to the financial statements for a discussion on related party transaction**\n\n**Results of the three Ended March 31, 2024, Compared to the three ended March 31, 2023**\n\n**Net Sales**\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, our total revenue was $1,513,026 compared to $551,869 for the same period in 2023. The higher revenue was contributed to the deconsolidation of Shya’s business.\n\n**Segment breakdown**\n\nThe three months ended March 31, 2024, our revenue from Engineering and Manufacturing was $9,342 compared to zero for the same period in 2023. Our engineering team is in transition to establish the innovation center in Europe and has executed a master services agreement with RPG to support its fortune 500 customers with its sustainability goals. Additionally, our engineering team will be commencing work on the Vermont project starting in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, our revenue from HRS was $72,488 compared to $10,942 for the same period in 2023. We have a large pipeline of opportunities in this segment and are working diligently to complete the engineering and design, enabling us to execute contractual agreements and close these opportunities. The sales cycle for these types of opportunities is long due to cost factors and the integration of the technology. We are also working with financial institutions to assist in financing the projects as we increasingly move towards Independent Power Producer models.\n\nFor the three months ending March 31, 2024, our revenue from our natural gas (NG) business amounted to $1,219,629, down from $540,927 for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase can be attributed to the deconsolidation of Shuya’s revenue and our strategic decision to prioritize non-Chinese markets over expansion into the ASEAN region.\n\n**Gross Profit**\n\nIn the three months ending March 31, 2024, our gross profits totaled $253,004, marking an favorable increase compared to $160,569 recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. This uptick in gross profit can be attributed to elevated margins stemming from the increase from our non-Chinese NG business, alongside the successful launch of our waste-to-energy plant in Vermont.\n\n**Segment breakdown**\n\nFor the three months ending March 31, 2024, our gross profit from Engineering and Manufacturing amounted to $7,806, compared for the same period in 2023. This segment is a recent addition to CETY’s portfolio, currently serving as a support for our ongoing internal projects. Nevertheless, it is anticipated to expand notably as CETY shifts its focus towards providing comprehensive end-to-end integrated solutions.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, our gross profit from HRS was $51,598, in compared to $5,128 for the corresponding period in 2023. This increase in margins primarily stemmed from increased service activities, which did not include equipment sales.\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, our gross profit from our wholly owned subsidiary, JHJ, was $9,852, a decrease from $12,959 recorded for the corresponding period in 2023. This decline was primarily attributed to the deconsolidation of the Shuya business unit. It’s worth noting that our NG business typically operates on slim margins. Looking ahead, we intend to leverage our presence in China to foster synergistic partnerships and facilitate technology transfers, particularly in the growing EV charging sector. Additionally, we aim to explore cross-selling opportunities for our waste heat recovery and waste-to-energy products within the Chinese market.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**Selling, General and Administrative (SG &A) Expenses.**\n\nFor the three-month period ending March 31, 2024, our SG&A expenses totaled $218,658, an increase from $88,891 for the same period in 2023. This increase can be attributed to increased spending in IT, insurance expenditures particularly the D&O policy, and increased spending on repairs and maintenance, largely driven by the recent relocation of our HRS operations.\n\n**Salaries Expense**\n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, our Salaries expense totaled $511,111, marking a significant increase from $158,557 recorded during the same period in 2023. This surge in expenses for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, can be attributed to the inclusion of key personnel such as our CFO, director of operations, director of technology, and the recruitment of four additional engineers. Our strategy involves fortifying our team from the ground up to establish a robust foundation for scalable growth, reinforced by cutting-edge technology and streamlined systems. We hold strong conviction in the capabilities of our assembled team, envisioning their collective efforts leading us to a position of leadership within the clean energy sector.\n\n**Travel Expense**\n\nThe three months ended March 31, 2024; our travel expense was $29,652 compared to $71,662 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to lower travel expenses related to China NG business development.\n\n**Professional fees legal and accounting**\n\nFor the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, our Professional Fees expense totaled $126,105, marking an increase from $88,210 in the corresponding period of 2023. This rise in accounting fees can be attributed directly to engaging a new audit firm, which incurred higher costs.\n\n**Facility Lease and Maintenance Expense**\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, our Facility Lease and maintenance expenses totaled $71,275, marking a significant decrease from the $122,779 incurred during the same period in 2023. This reduction in cost can be attributed to the strategic relocation and separation of our corporate offices from our HRS operations, resulting in a cost-saving measure.\n\n**Depreciation and Amortization Expense**\n\nThe three months ended March 31, 2024, our depreciation and amortization expense was 2,969 compared to $5,949 for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Change in Derivative Liability**\n\nThe three months ended March 31, 2024; we had no derivative liability compared to a gain of $326,539 for the same period in 2023. The gain in derivative liability was from a favorable derivative calculation from several convertible notes in the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\n**Interest and Finance Fees**\n\nDuring the three months ending on March 31, 2024, interest and finance fees amounted to $295,193, as opposed to $837,391 for the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in interest and fees for the March 31, 2024 period can be attributed to less number of notes and bridge financing aimed at facilitating the uplisting to Nasdaq. Despite the decrease in interest and fees for the March 31, 2024 period, we believe that the cost of capital for CETY remains elevated. The delay in securing affordable financing for our Vermont project resulted in our reliance on high-cost financing options. We are working diligently to finalize our financing in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n43  \n---  \n  \n**Net Loss**\n\nFor the three months ending March 31, 2024, our loss amounted to $1,419,400, representing an increase from the loss of $1,110,390 incurred during the corresponding period in 2023. This increase is attributed to expenditures in salaries, IT, relocation, and legal and professional fees.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n**Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.**\n\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\nfor the three months ended March 31,\n\n(unaudited)\n\n2024 | 2023  \n---|---  \nNet cash (used in) operating activities | $| (871,636| ) | $| (641,093| )  \nNet cash provided by investing activities | 83,460 | 39,797  \nNet cash provided by financing activities | 987,871 | 3,247,540  \nForeign Currency Transaction | 161 | 63,313  \nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents | $| 289,481 | $| 2,709,557  \n  \n**Capital Requirements for Long-Term Obligations**\n\n**None.**\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies**\n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\n\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, _“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”_ (“ASC 606”).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10_\n\nAn entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\na. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).\n\nb. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).\n\nc. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).\n\n44  \n---  \n  \nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our business:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \n_Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-30_\n\nIf a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\n\nb. The customer has legal title to the asset\n\nc. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\n\nd. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\n\ne. The customer has accepted the asset\n\nThe core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \n45  \n---  \n  \nThe following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:\n\n● | We generate a quotation  \n---|---  \n● | We receive Purchase orders from our customers.  \n● | We build the product to their specification  \n● | We invoice at the time of shipment  \n● | The terms are typically Net 30 days  \n  \nThe following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:\n\n● | CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service.   \n---|---  \n  \n_A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):_\n\na. | A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer to the customer may not qualify.  \n---|---  \nb. | A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.  \nc. | A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer.  \n  \nIf the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.\n\nDuring the project development and engineering phase of our CETY Renewable projects such as VRG, we employ the input method of revenue recognition to estimate revenue based on projected costs. This approach involves forecasting future costs and revenues to determine the amount of revenue we recognize in the current period. It’s important to understand, however, that these recognized revenue figures are not final and are subject to adjustments. Changes may occur as we gain more clarity on actual costs compared to our initial projections, affecting the revenue recognized accordingly.\n\nThe projected costs of the VRG project is based on estimates and profitability will be impacted depending on actual costs. Using the input method for revenue recognition, the amount of recorded revenue is also affected depending on the estimated total costs. The purchase price allocation for Shuya was also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company. The inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company.\n\nAdditionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:\n\nBecause the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.\n\nIn recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.\n\n● | The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n● | CETY and customer agree to a total EPC Contract price.  \n● | The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.  \n● | Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.  \n  \n46  \n---  \n  \nSecondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with the its agreement with its clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.\n\nCETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.\n\nCETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There are no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.\n\nIn review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.\n\nIn reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.\n\nFinally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.\n\nFor CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nDuring the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.\n\nWe have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.\n\nAlso, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 we had $33,000 and 33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of year 2024.\n\nAlso from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding customer deposits of $210,310 and $80,475 respectively.\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n**Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation**\n\nChengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (the “Xiangyueheng”), which owns a 10% equity interest in Shuya, entered a three-party Concerted Action Agreement (the “CAA”), wherein the parties agreed to vote in unison at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agreed that during the term of the CAA, before any of the three parties intends to propose motions to the shareholders’ meetings or the board of directors, or exercise their voting rights on any matter that shall be presented to and resolved through the shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the laws, regulations, Articles of Association of Shuya or any relevant shareholders’ agreements, the three parties will discuss, negotiate, and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.\n\nAs a result of the CAA, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (the “VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nOn January 1, 2024, and effective on the same date, JHJ, SSET and Xiangyueheng entered into the Agreement on the Termination of the Concerted Action Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), pursuant to which the parties released each other from any and all obligations under the CAA. Due to the Termination Agreement, the Company now holds less than 50% of the voting rights in Shuya. The Company analyzed whether Shuya should be consolidated under ASC 810 and determined Shuya is no longer required to be consolidated on January 1, 2024 after the execution of the Termination Agreement. Accordingly, the Company will not consolidate Shuya into its consolidated financial statements on or after January 1, 2024.\n\n**Series E Valuation**\n\nAdditionally, the inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company and fair value measurements, furthermore, the purchase price allocation was based on estimates of fair market values.\n\n**Future Financing**\n\nWe will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares to continue to fund our business operations. Issuance of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.\n\n**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**\n\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.\n\n**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.\n\n48  \n---  \n  \n**Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures.**\n\n**_Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures_**\n\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024, due to the material weaknesses resulting from the Board of Directors not currently having any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and controls were not designed and in place to ensure that all disclosures required were originally addressed in our financial statements.

Product sales consist of demand from customers in many different markets with different levels of cyclicality and seasonality.\n\nOperating performance is dependent on the Company’s ability to manage changes in input costs for items such as raw materials, labor, and overhead operating costs. Performance is also affected by manufacturing efficiencies, including items such as on time delivery, quality, scrap, and productivity. Market factors of supply and demand can impact operating costs.\n\n**Who We Are**\n\nWe develop renewable energy products and solutions and establish partnerships in renewable energy that make environmental and economic sense. Our mission is to be a segment leader in the Zero Emission Revolution by offering eco-friendly green energy solutions, clean energy fuels and alternative electric power for small and mid-sized projects in North America, Europe, and Asia. We target sustainable energy solutions that are profitable for us, profitable for our customers and represent the future of global energy production.\n\n**Our principal businesses**\n\n**Waste Heat Recovery Solutions** – we recycle wasted heat produced in manufacturing, waste to energy and power generation facilities using our patented Clean CycleTM generator to create electricity which can be recycled or sold to the grid.\n\n**Waste to Energy Solutions** - we convert waste products created in manufacturing, agriculture, wastewater treatment plants and other industries to electricity, renewable natural gas (“RNG”), hydrogen and bio char which are sold or used by our customers.\n\n**Engineering, Consulting and Project Management Solutions** – We have expanded our legacy electronics and manufacturing business and plan to manufacture component parts for our Waste Heat Recovery and Waste to Energy business and to provide consulting services to municipal and industrial customers and Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) companies so they can identify, design and incorporate clean energy solutions in their projects.\n\n**CETY HK**\n\nClean Energy Technologies (H.K.) Limited (“CETY HK”) consists of two business ventures in mainland China:(i) our natural gas (“NG”) trading operations sourcing and suppling NG to industries and municipalities. The NG is principally used for heavy truck refueling stations and urban or industrial users. We purchase large quantities of NG from large wholesale NG depots at fixed prices which are prepaid for in advance at a discount to market. We sell the NG to our customers at prevailing daily spot prices for the duration of the contracts; and (ii) our planned joint venture with a large state-owned gas enterprise in China called Shenzhen Gas (Hong Kong) International Co. Ltd. (“Shenzhen Gas”), acquiring natural gas pipeline operator facilities, primarily located in the southwestern part of China. Our planned joint venture with Shenzhen Gas plans to acquire, with financing from Shenzhen Gas, natural gas pipeline operator facilities with the goal of aggregating and selling the facilities to Shenzhen Gas in the future. According to our Framework Agreement with Shenzhen Gas, we will be required to contribute $8 million to the joint venture which plans to raise in future rounds of financing. The terms of the joint venture are subject to the execution of definitive agreements.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n**_Our Business Strategy_**\n\nOur strategy is focused on further developing our existing Waste Heat Recovery business while expanding into the rapidly growing markets for Waste to Energy Solutions and integrated clean energy engineering, and project management services. We are initiating a strategic transition to function increasingly as an independent power producer.\n\n_Our strategy focuses on three main elements:_\n\n● | Expanding our Waste Heat Recovery product line to include waste heat recovery ORC systems producing over 1 MW of power so we can qualify for midsized and large heat recovery projects in the United States, China, Southeast Asian and Pacific Rim countries.  \n---|---  \n● | Establishing a Waste to Energy business by selling our ablative thermal processing products based on proprietary HTAP technology and developing small and mid-sized waste to energy power plants producing electricity and RNG for the grid and methane, hydrogen and biochar for resale.  \n● | Leveraging our engineering, procurement and manufacturing experience in Waste Heat Recovery and Waste to Energy to assist companies and EPCs incorporate clean energy solutions into energy and industrial construction projects.  \n  \nWe intend to implement this strategy through:\n\n◌ | Adding a new ORC system manufactured by Enertime for Waste Heat Recovery that will enable us to implement projects in the U.S. markets producing between 1 MW and 10 MW of electricity.  \n---|---  \n◌ | Taking advantage of Inflation Reduction act of 2022 federal investment tax credits and state incentives that now include waste heat recover as a recognized clean energy source making our Clean Cycle Generator and ORC systems more profitable to install. On August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction act offering 30% Investment Tax Credit and technology neutral tax credits offering clean electricity production credit and investment credit. CETY’s products directly benefit from these tax credits.  \n◌ | Benefiting from higher energy costs which provide higher returns on our Waste Heat Recovery and Waste to Energy products and projects.  \n◌ | Improving our balance sheet and capital position to permit us to invest in more products and projects.  \n◌ | Establishing HTAP manufacturing facilities in Turkey for our Waste to Energy products and expanding patent protection on the proprietary technology.  \n◌ | Leveraging our existing marketing channels to sell HTAP Waste to Energy products to industrial companies and government agencies.  \n◌ | Working with clean energy project development and finance companies to establish Waste to Energy power plants producing electricity, RNG, hydrogen, methane and biochar from biomass, municipal waste, timber waste and other biomass and while retaining an equity interest in these facilities to provide re-occurring revenue.  \n◌ | Participate in other minority investments in medium to large clean energy projects being developed in ASEAN countries that may be sourced by our majority stockholder in Hong Kong and other capital partners.  \n◌ | Leveraging the LNG trading and investment relationships to create opportunities for us to sell our Waste Recovery and Waste to Energy products in China and to provide engineering, consulting and project management services.  \n  \n5  \n---  \n  \n**Business and Segment Information**\n\nWe design, produce and market clean energy products and integrated solutions focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy. Our aim is to become a leading provider of renewable and energy efficiency products and solutions by helping commercial companies and municipalities reduce energy waste and emissions, lower energy costs and generate incremental revenue by providing electricity, renewable natural gas and biochar to the grid.\n\nSegment Information\n\nOur four segments for accounting purposes are:\n\n**Clean Energy HRS & CETY Europe** – Our Waste Heat Recovery Solutions, converting thermal energy to zero emission electricity.\n\n**CETY Renewables Waste to Energy Solutions** – Providing Waste to Energy technologies and solutions.\n\n**Engineering and Manufacturing Business** – providing customers with comprehensive design, manufacturing, and project management solutions.\n\n**CETY HK** – The parent company of our NG trading operations in China. Prior to the first quarter of 2022 the Company had three reportable segments but added the CETY HK segment to reflect its recent new businesses in China.\n\nOur Clean Energy Solutions Business\n\n_Waste Heat Recovery Solutions_\n\nWe provide our customers with power plants that capture wasted heat energy and produce electricity using a unique Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) system containing our Clean CycleTM generator. Our magnetic bearing Integrated Power Modules is at the heart of our Clean CycleTM generator which can fit into a standard cargo container we call our Containerized System Module, producing 140KW per Clean Cycle generator and can be linked together for projects generating up to 1MW of power.\n\nOur recent agreement with Enertime now permits us to install midsized and large ORC systems (between 1 MW and 10 MW) in the United States, allowing us to offer a full range of ORC systems to our customers. We believe this new capacity will enable us to expand our product offerings into larger scale waste recovery products in the United States. Enertime is a leader in producing ORC systems in Europe.\n\nORC waste heat recycling systems use pressurized working fluids that have a lower boiling point than water which make them ideal to repurpose waste heat into electricity. While most manufacturing processes do not produce enough heat to turn water into steam, there is enough heat to generate pressurized refrigerant in our ORC systems which is used to turn a turbine at high speeds to generate electricity.\n\nWe can link up to 10 Clean Cycle Generators together which can generate up to 10 GWh of electricity per year from waste heat which we estimate would reduce up to 5000 metric tons of CO2 production per year in an industrial heat recovery system or the annual equivalent of the CO2 emissions of approximately 2000 cars per year.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \nWe believe the most important component in any ORC system is the turbine generator because it converts the steam heat into electricity and accounts for approximately 60% of the cost of the system. The more efficiently the turbine generator works, the better the ORC power plant operates. The remaining components consisting of the low boiling point fluid, condensers, which cool the fluids, the feed pumps, which pressurize the fluids to reduce boiling points and the heat exchangers, which extract the heat from the heat sources. These are more commoditized products and tend to perform at similar levels of efficiencies at similar price points.\n\nWe believe our Clean CycleTM generator is the most efficient turbine generator in it’s class and size available in the market for ORC systems generating up to 1 MW. We estimate that the Clean CycleTM generator has higher efficiency of approximately 15% than our competitors and its magnetic design eliminates the use of oils and lubricants, significantly reducing down time, repairs and operating costs. Our Integrated Power Module is compact and fit into a standard cargo container that can be delivered on a turnkey basis resulting in lower installation and implementation costs than on-site assembly.\n\nWe believe these features and benefits give us an important competitive advantage when building heat recovery power plants for our customers and provide us with the opportunity to compete with and obtain market share from the dominant industrial waste heat to power systems.\n\nOver 121 Clean CycleTM generators have been deployed to date with 88 units used in biomass and waste to energy projects, 4 with diesel electric generators, 3 with turbine electric generators and 26 in industrial electric production applications. We expect to raise additional funds to expand our capacity to install 6-8 units per year which should approximately double our sales on a year-to-year basis.\n\nThe patented technology used in Clean CycleTM generator was purchased from General Electric International, together with over 100 installation sites, making us one of the leading provider of small-scale industrial waste heat to power systems. We have an exclusive license from Calnetix to use their magnetic turbine for heat waste recovery applications.\n\n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/ceff411554bd58f0ebbe7fe487ca8330-form10-k_001.jpg) | ![](https://cdn.kscope.io/ceff411554bd58f0ebbe7fe487ca8330-form10-k_002.jpg)  \n---|---  \nOur Integrated Power Module | Our Clean Cycle TM Generator  \n  \n7  \n---  \n  \n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/ceff411554bd58f0ebbe7fe487ca8330-form10-k_003.jpg)\n\nA complete ORC System with Integrated Power Module housed in a Containerized System Module (CSM)\n\n_Waste to Energy Solutions_\n\nWe are adding a new business line in our clean energy solutions segment consisting of Waste to Energy processing equipment, engineering services and Waste to Energy processing power plant joint ventures where we expect to retain an ownership interest in the project.\n\nWaste-to-Energy technologies that process non-renewable waste can reduce environmental and health damages while generating sustainable energy. Waste-to-Energy technologies consist of waste treatment process that creates energy in the form of electricity, heat or fuels from a waste source. These technologies can be applied to several types of waste: from the biomass (e.g. woodchips) to semi-solid (e.g. thickened sludge from effluent treatment plants) to liquid (e.g. domestic sewage) and gaseous (e.g. refinery gases) waste.\n\n**Waste to Energy Solutions can be used:**\n\n● | In any town, city or province with established waste management and collection.  \n---|---  \n● | Where there is a consistent supply of solid waste.  \n● | Places where treatment costs increase with shortages of space to store waste.  \n● | In areas with high energy prices to allow for cost of recovery from waste.  \n  \n**Waste to Energy Solutions have many benefits:**\n\n● | Electricity from Waste to Energy plants can be generated from small amounts up to 30 MW providing for a wide range of opportunities to sell it back to the grid.  \n---|---  \n● | The synthetic renewable fuel gas produced from waste can be used for various production recyclable energy such as hot water, thermo-oil or steam, renewable natural gas or hydrogen.  \n● | Landfill waste is reduced and so is leachate and methane released from decomposing landfills.  \n● | Waste is a reliable source of energy and production is typically predictable and low cost whereas fossil fuel prices can fluctuate dramatically.  \n  \n8  \n---  \n  \n**But Traditional Incineration Methods Have Significant Downsides:**\n\n● | Air pollution can increase because scrubbing technologies are very expensive to install.  \n---|---  \n● | Many industrial, agricultural, and mixed municipal solid wastes have high moisture content at source and direct incineration of such waste requires burning fossil fuel.  \n● | to maintain thermal conversion process.  \n● | Carbon is released into the air which would otherwise be stored in landfill.  \n● | Ash and flue gas cleaning residues from incineration can also cause poisonous leachate problems if not properly disposed of which is costly and causes downstream environmental issues.  \n● | Generating electricity from incineration releases _more_ CO2, SO2, NOx and mercury than natural gas.  \n  \n(Source: https://www.energyforgrowth.org/memo/waste-to-energy-one-solution-for-two-problems/)\n\nThe most common form of waste to energy systems are based on incinerators which simply burn waste using air. The Thermal Treatment on Grate is the most widespread technology being used by large waste landfills to generate electricity and heat. These systems produce substantial amounts of ash, heavy metals and carbon dioxide which need to be treated and disposed of to minimize its impact on the environment. They also require substantial amounts of pre-treatments prior to burning.\n\nThe Thermal on Grate incineration process, while wide-spread, is too expensive and complex for smaller and mid-sized waste to energy projects creating, what we believe, a significant market opportunity in small and mid-sized waste processing applications to create not only electricity but valuable renewable natural gas, bio diesel oil, hydrogen, methane, and biochar.\n\nOur solution is a patented High Temperature Ablative Pyrolysis (HTAP) Biomass Reactor as viable commercial solution to the costs and environmental problems posed by traditional incarnation methods. We have the exclusive license and right to sell the HTAP10 and HTAP5 and related products manufactured by Enex which has a proven installed commercial base of customers using its waste to energy solutions. We believe this is an ideal solution to process waste for small to mid-sized waste to energy generation applications needed for processing industrial and municipality solid waste, agriculture waste, and forestry waste.\n\nPyrolysis systems decompose waste without the use of oxygen under varying pressurized conditions and at temperatures ranging from 300 degrees Celsius and 1,300 degrees Celsius. The major advantage of pyrolysis is that it is a cost-effective technology and helps curb environmental pollution. Pyrolysis systems are gradually replacing traditional incineration and gaining momentum in the waste to energy processing market addresses many of the pre-treatment issues and, when using high temperature and high-pressure, substantially reduce or eliminates pollutant. (Source: “Life Cycle Assessment of Waste-to-Bioenergy Processes: a Review” Pooja Ghosh,... Arunaditya Sahay, in Bioreactors, 2020)\n\nPyrolysis systems can produce hydrogen, renewable natural gas, bio-diesel oil, charcoal, and biochar which are used to power hydrogen, diesel, and natural gas engines or electrical turbines which can be sold and often are eligible for substantial tax and pricing benefits. When compared with the conventional incineration plant that runs in the capacity of kilotons per day, the scale of the pyrolysis plant is more flexible, and the output of pyrolysis can be integrated with other downstream technologies for product upgrading. (Source: Influential Aspects in Waste Management Practices Karthik Rajendran PhD,. Jerry D. Murphy PhD, in Sustainable Resource Recovery and Zero Waste Approaches, 2019) In addition, BioChar stores and reduces atmospheric CO2 and can be used as a soil conditioner, an organic component of animal feeds, construction materials, wastewater treatment and in textiles. (Source: https://www.bioenergyconsult.com/applications-of-biochar/)\n\nThe ablative pyrolysis system is a waste to energy process that largely eliminates pre-treatment and the harmful pollutants and storage waste produced when using standard incineration and other pyrolysis technologies. It uses high pressure to generate fast pyrolysis and is designed so that the heat transferred from a hot reactor wall softens the feedstock under pressure and permits larger feedstock particles to be processed without pre-treatment. These systems create high relative motion between the reactor wall and the feedstock. The process avoids the need of inert gas and hence the processing equipment is small and the reaction system is more intense. (Source: http://biofuelsacademy.org/index.html%3Fp=608.html )\n\n9  \n---  \n  \nCETY has licensed proprietary patented ablative pyrolysis system for commercial use that has been installed in 7 sites for use in waste to energy creating applications processing including peat, coal, flax waste, sawdust and wood scrap, straw, buckwheat husks, and cardboard, tapes, films and paper machine sludge. The technology has been implemented over 1,500 onsite power generation projects in Russia working with major energy production companies such as Gazprom, Rosneft, Lukoil and Rostelecom as well as completing several projects for customers in the European Union, Middle East and United States. Due to the conflict in the Ukraine, ENEX is redomiciling and relocating key personnel to Turkey where it will complete an existing project and is expected to wind down its operations. CETY will develop additional ablative technology and expects to manufacture units in the United States. Sales and European distribution will be run out of a CETY office that has been established in Turkey.\n\nCETY has global rights (except Russia and CIS countries) to design, build, manufacture, sell and operate renewable energy and waste recovery facilities HTAP10 and HTAP5 systems and other products and technologies we expect to develop in the future.\n\nThe patented HTAP technology utilizes a higher temperature that uses a cleaner gas for the heating process and a more efficient biogas turbine. The units can be customized to produce hydrogen, natural gas, diesel oil and bio char in varying quantities which can be sold or used to produce electricity. We believe that the key benefits of the HTAP Biomass Reactor are:\n\n● | Flexibility in waste sourcing and mixing.  \n---|---  \n● | Customized outputs of hydrogen, synthetic fuels, natural gas, methane, biochar, carbon black, or construction materials.  \n● | Better waste sourcing and mixing flexibility,  \n● | Near-zero emissions,  \n● | Modular design,  \n● | Zero liquid discharge,  \n● | Zero solid waste residue waste.  \n● | Modular, containerize design reducing implementation costs  \n● | Proven commercial implementation.  \n  \nWe are targeting industrial and municipality solid waste, landfill waste, agriculture waste (straw, stems, plant biomass, manure, crop wastage), and forestry waste from tree cuttings and shredded products.\n\nWe are in the process of identifying projects domestically and internationally for the HTAP Biomass Reactor. We believe the first project where we expect to implement the HTAP10 technology with Vermont Renewable Gas to develop a biomass renewable energy processing facility. The project is planned for a location in Lyndon, Vermont to convert forest and agriculture biomass waste products to renewably generated electricity and BioChar fertilizer. We expect to annually deliver up to 18,000 MWh of renewable electricity and 1,500 tons of BioChar. The Vermont Renewable Gas project is one of the many renewable energy processing facilities we plan to commission.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/ceff411554bd58f0ebbe7fe487ca8330-form10-k_004.jpg)\n\nENEX HTAP 10 Waste to Energy Processing Plant.\n\nWe established a wholly owned subsidiary called CETY Capital that we expect will help us finance our customers renewable energy projects producing low carbon energy. CETY Capital, when implemented, should add flexibility to the capacity CETY offers its customers and fund projects utilizing its products and clean energy solutions. The in-house financing arm is expected to support our sales and build new renewable energy facilities. To date we have conducted no material operations in this subsidiary.\n\n_Our Clean Energy Initiatives in China_\n\nNatural gas is China’s fastest-growing primary fuel with demand quadrupling in the past decade. Developing the natural gas sector is a critical aspect China’s effort to reduce reliance on coal. According to the International Energy Agency, China is the world’s sixth-largest natural gas producer, the third-largest consumer, and the second-largest importer. In 2050, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects China to consume nearly three times as much natural gas as it did in 2018, which was 280.30 b/cm. China’s natural gas consumption accounted for 8.3% of its total energy mix in 2019. China anticipates boosting the share of natural gas as part of total energy consumption to 14% by 2030. Before COVID 19, China was expected to account for a third of global demand growth through 2022, thanks in part to the country’s “Blue Skies” policy and the strong drive to improve air quality. China’s relatively strong economic recovery from the COVID 19 crisis will probably increase that share. Natural gas is imported either through pipelines or as liquefied natural gas (LNG) on ships. According to Reuters, in 2019, the largest sources for Chinese LNG imports were Australia, Qatar, Malaysia, and Indonesia. ( Source: U.S. Department of Commerce, International TradeAdministration.https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/china energy#:~:text=China%20anticipates%20boosting%20the%20share,drive%20to%20improve%20air%20quality.)\n\nLiquid Natural Gas in the Chinese energy market produces half as much carbon dioxide, less than a third as much nitrogen oxides, and 1 percent as much sulfur oxides at the power plant compared to the average air emissions from coal-fired generation. In addition to reduced air emissions, natural gas has other environmental benefits that make it a smart fuel choice. Natural gas-fired power plants use about 60 percent less water than coal plants and 75 percent less water than nuclear power plants for the same electricity output. (Source: Conoco Phillips)\n\nIn 2021, we acquired through our subsidiary, CETY Hong Kong, a liquefied natural gas trading operation called Jiangsu Huanya Jieneng (“JHJ”) which sources LNG from large LNG producers and distributors and sells it to non-state-owned industries and downstream customers in mainland China.\n\nCETY also plans to sell its waste heat recovery and waste to energy products in China as well as provide consulting services relating to the same to projects in China.\n\nThe JHJ team has more than 10 years of experience in the natural gas and clean energy industry and has maintained relationships and partners with many natural gas enterprises in China.\n\n11  \n---  \n  \n_CETY HK_\n\n**_LNG Trading Operations_**\n\nJHJ’s principal service is to source and supply LNG to industries and municipalities located in the southern part of Sichuan Province and portions of Yunnan Province. The LNG is principally used for heavy truck refueling stations and urban or industrial users in areas that do not have a connection to local LNG pipeline systems. We purchase large quantities of LNG from large wholesale LNG depots at fixed prices which are prepaid for in advance at a discount to market. We sell the LNG to our customers at prevailing daily spot prices for the duration of the contracts.\n\nEither our sources or customers arrange for delivery of the LNG. Our profitability depends on our ability to purchase LNG at volume discounts at the beginning of a season and sell it at a delivered price that is higher than the price we pay.\n\nJHJ traders are experienced LNG traders, familiar with the spot and future markets and have relationships with the major users of LNG in the areas that we serve. Our customers may be local or may be as far as 700km from each depot.\n\nWe compete with other LNG trading based on availability and price. We target our discount with our sources to partially hedge against falling spot prices and give us a gross profit targeted at substantially higher rate than our competitors which are approximately 20-30 percent margins compared against what we believe are 1-5 percent margins by our competitors. So long as there are no major fluctuations in the spot market, we can offer more competitive prices due to the discounts we receive from the large volumes purchased and the prepayments for the LNG. JHJ has currently established a supply of approximately 8,000 tons of LNG for distribution.\n\nWe are able to purchase LNG at a significant discount from our suppliers because our prepayments offer suppliers more certainty with respect to the sales of their inventory, address their cash flow issues, and allow them to better plan for production. We believe our downstream customers get better prices from us because of our bulk buying power, ease of inventory management and cash flow.\n\nBoth our suppliers and customers can reduce costs by using JHJ as a centralized procurement center and establishing professional logistics distribution based on stable supply and downstream demand.\n\nequity interests subject to dilution by additional equity investment into HHNG by third parties. We do not expect the project to require additional investment from us, JHJ or HHNG. The project is currently planning and constructing additional pipelines in the Heze area and is expected to generate cash flow by the first quarter of 2023. We do not expect to make further direct minority investments in other pipeline operators as we expect these acquisitions to take place through our joint venture with Shenzhen Gas.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**Engineering, Consulting and Project Management Services**\n\nEngineering _._ Our global engineering team supports the design, build, installation, and maintenance of our Clean CycleTM generators, supports our technology customers and innovative start-ups with a broad range of electrical, mechanical and software engineering services.

(Source: https://wteinternational.com/news/waste-to-energy-technologies-overview/). The waste-to-energy (WTE) market is expected to register a CAGR of 7.35% during the forecast period of 2021 – 2026, reaching a market size of USD 69.94 billion by 2026, up from USD 43.66 billion in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the market negatively in the form of supply chain disruptions and delays in project implementation. However, the market is expected to recover from 2021, owing to the increasing efforts to promote waste-to-energy plants by various countries across the world. In addition to this, an increasing amount of waste generation and growing concern for waste management to meet the need for sustainable urban living and increasing focus on non-fossil fuel sources of energy are driving the demand for the waste-to-energy market. Thermal technology is expected to dominate the waste-to-energy market in the coming years, owing to the increasing development in incineration and gasification technologies, as well as the increasing amount of waste generated, especially from the emerging economies of Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific has witnessed significant development in the waste-to-energy industry in the past few years. It has dominated the market across the world with increasing efforts taken by the government in adopting better MSW management practices, providing incentives for waste-to-energy projects in the form of capital subsidies and feed-in tariffs, and providing financial support for R&D projects on a cost-sharing basis. Due to economic development and rapid urbanization in China, the generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been increasing rapidly. Therefore, the effective disposal of municipal solid waste has become a serious environmental challenge in China.

For instance, according to Federal Power Act 2019, this act gives federal authority over electric utilities in U.S. Also the acts like Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) and Energy Policy Act are applied by the government to increase the waste to energy and decrease the CO2 emission by fossil fuels. In addition, escalating investments in R&D by different countries is also fostering the growth of global waste to energy market.

Moreover, a shift in trend towards replacing conventional energy generating from fossil fuels with renewable energy to ensure energy security and reduce carbon emissions are potential factors to drive industry growth. The global waste to energy market size was valued at $35.1 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $50.1 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 4.6% from 2020 to 2027.\n\nhttps://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/waste-to-energy-market\n\nWaste Heat Recovery\n\nA study by Market Research Future in October of 2021 forecasted the waste heat recover market would be worth USD 114 billion by 2028 registering a CAGR of 9.2 per year from a baseline of USD 59.44 billion in 2020. The primary economic driver in the waste heat recovery market are “rising energy use, economic development, and rising electricity prices. The use of energy in many sectors to manufacture products is steadily growing. The need for energy has increased in industrialized regions as industrialization has occurred. Companies are developing numerous strategies to transform waste heat into energy as the demand for energy grows. As a result, it is fueling the growth of the Waste Heat Recovery market. The government has taken various initiatives and enacted rules to save energy, which has promoted the usage of Waste Heat Recovery technologies. Due to environmental concerns, the government is taking steps to save energy; as a result, the Waste Heat Recovery sector is booming. Energy-efficient technology has become critical for industries looking to save money.” (Source: https://www.yahoo.com/now/waste-heat-recovery-market-worth-095200052.html)\n\nIn 2020 North America constituted the largest share of the market accounting for approximately 33% of the global total but countries in Asia and the Asia Pacific constitute the fasting growing geographic sectors due to rapid industrial expansion.\n\nWaste heat recovery systems in the United States now qualify for beneficial investment tax credits of up to 26% on the investment driving additional companies to install ORC industrial waste heat to power units. Owners of waste energy recovery property can claim a 26% ITC if construction of such property begins during 2021 or 2022, and a 22% ITC if construction begins during 2023, provided in each case that the property is placed in service by the end of 2025.

It diversifies the energy portfolio of the state while encouraging economic development. By establishing an RPS a state creates a market for Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). Each utility must obtain and retire a certain number of RECs annually. Several states including Colorado, Wisconsin, Illinois and California among others have now list waste heat to power as an eligible resource in their RPS program.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \nLNG Trading and Joint Venture\n\nSince 2012, the National Development and Reform Commission has stressed that “natural gas vehicles, including urban buses, taxis, logistics distribution vehicles, trucks and other natural gas-fueled transportation vehicles” are the most important users of natural gas and require a consistent supply chain. As a result, regions and provinces in the PRC have accelerated the construction of a network of LNG refueling stations and encouraged the expansion of fleets of delivery vehicles. Due to China’s “carbon peak, carbon neutral” goal commitment, China’s environmental protection policies are gradually being tightened resulting in increased utilization rates of natural gas as a clean energy alternative is getting higher and higher. (Source China 13th Renewable Energy Development Five Year Plan https://www.iea.org/policies/6277-china-13th-renewable-energy-development-five-year-plan-2016-2020)\n\nBy 2027, analysts forecast spot trade in LNG will be $20 billion, more than double its 2020 value. Last year, China’s imports soared by 18% to a record 79 million tons, overtaking Japan as the world’s largest LNG buyer. China’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was one factor, but the other was a pipeline reform that allowed more firms to become importers. (Source: Reuters U.S. supplies give China muscle to become major force in global LNG trade https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-supplies-give-china-muscle-become-major-force-global-lng-trade-2022-02-11/)\n\nAligning with many policy goals, natural gas will remain a growth engine for energy supply in the 14th FYP period. The policy direction on air pollution reduction, carbon emission control, and gas supply and midstream infrastructure development indicates continued support for higher penetration of gas in the growing energy mix. On the other hand, the focus on supply security and cost reduction from market reforms indicate an expectation of decelerating gas demand growth in the 14th FYP period compared with that in the previous five years. In the current IHS Markit outlook, China’s gas demand will grow 6% compound annual average during 2021-25—compared with the 11% growth in the previous five year—to reach 429 Bcm in 2025.

China’s Five Yar Plan’s Review and Expectation: Batural Gas Tick the Box for Many Policy Goals. https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/chinas-fiveyear-plans-review-and-expectation-natural-gas-ticks.html).\n\nWe believe that Southwest China is rich in natural gas resources providing us with a stable source of supply and is an important major natural gas producing area in the country. We estimate that there are 16 LNG production plants with a capacity of more than 300,000 cubic meters per day in Southwest China, with a total design capacity of 11.7 million cubic meters per day. We believe the supply is mainly to satisfy LNG refueling stations and LNG vehicles which are among our primary downstream customers.\n\nWe estimate that by the end of 2022, a total of about 240 LNG refueling stations were operating in South Western China, including about 170 in Sichuan, about 30 in Yunnan, and about 40 in Guizhou; the daily consumption of LNG refueling stations that have been put into operation in Yunguichuan is about 7,200 tons per day, which is basically the same as the upstream output, reaching a “balance of production and sales”.\n\nIn order to help achieve the goal of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality”, accelerate the clean and low-carbon transformation of transportation energy, the Sichuan Provincial Development and Reform Commission and Sichuan Provincial Energy Administration issued the “Sichuan Province Natural Gas Vehicle Refueling Station Layout Plan (2021-2025)”, which proposed that by 2025, Sichuan will build 500 new refueling stations (including 141 stations in the expressway service area ), including 15 CNG refueling stations, 401 LNG refueling stations, 8 L-CNG refueling stations, and 76 CNG/LNG joint refueling stations.\n\nBased on the development plan for LNG refueling stations in the southwest region we believe that the downstream demand for LNG by our customers will maintain a steady growth rate over the next five years.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**Sales and Marketing**\n\nWe utilize both a direct sales force and global distribution group with expertise in heat recovery solutions and clean energy markets.\n\nCETY maintains an online presence through our web portal and social media.

We believe our waste to energy products are more efficient for use in small and medium sized operations than our competitors and provide us with a competitive advantage on that basis.\n\nIn China, our NG trading operations compete with large state-owned LNG producers and importers such as Sinopec and many smaller local energy trading companies in the PRC. We compete based on price and consistency of services.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**Company Information**\n\nWe were incorporated in California in July 1995 under the name Probe Manufacturing Industries, Inc. We redomiciled to Nevada in April 2005 under the name Probe Manufacturing, Inc. We manufactured electronics and provided services to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of industrial, automotive, semiconductor, medical, communication, military, and high technology products. On September 11, 2015 Clean Energy HRS, or “CE HRS”, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired the assets of Heat Recovery Solutions from General Electric International. In November 2015, we changed our name to Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.\n\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1340 Reynolds Avenue Unit 120, Irvine, California 92614. Our telephone number is (949) 273-4990. Our common stock is listed on the OTCQB Markets under the symbol “CETY.”\n\nOur internet website address is www.cetyinc.com and our subsidiary’s web site is www.heatrecoverysolutions.com The information contained on our websites are not incorporated by reference into this document, and you should not consider any information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website as part of this document.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy HRS (HRS), CETY Europe, and the legacy electronic manufacturing services (Electronic Assembly) division and CETY Hong Kong\n\n**Patents**\n\nWe currently hold 16 patents in 6 countries and 28 pending applications in 8 countries, which were acquired from General Electric International relating to our magnetic turbine technology.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nAs part of our asset acquisition from General Electric International we acquired an exclusive, irrevocable, sublicensable, limited transferable, royalty free, fully paid, worldwide perpetual license to develop, improve and commercialize Calnetix’s magnetic turbine in any Organic Rankine Cycle based application where heat is sourced from a reciprocating combustion engine of any type, except marine vessels, any gas or steam turbine systems for electrical power generation applications or any type of biomass boiler system.\n\nWe have a intellectual property rights purchase and transfer agreement with ENEX for its pyrolysis system.\n\n**Facilities**\n\nWe’re headquartered in Irvine, California. Our Heat Recovery Solutions business unit operates from a 7,000 sq-ft state of the art facility in Irvine, California USA. We have in-house electro-mechanical assembly and testing capabilities. Our products are compliant with American Society of Mechanical Engineers and are UL and CE approved. We also have a 5000 sq-ft sales and service center located in Treviso, Italy. We also have a 2000 sq-ft R&D center in Antalya, Turky. Our Asian headquarters is located in Hong Kong and our 3000 sq-ft Engineering consultancy and Natural Gas Trading company is located in Chengdu.\n\n**Employees**\n\nWe presently have approximately 20 employees, including operational, engineering, accounting and marketing personnel. We utilize extensive number of consultants as well and have never experienced work stoppages and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. We have 7 employees in JSJ in China.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \n**Government Regulation**\n\nOur operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. We believe we operate in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements. However, material costs and liabilities may arise from these requirements or from new, modified or more stringent requirements. Material cost may rise due to additional manufacturing cost of raw or made parts with the application of new regulations. Our liabilities may also increase due to additional regulations imposed by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, and health and safety matters. In addition, our past, current and future operations and those of businesses we acquire, may give rise to claims of exposure by employees or the public or to other claims or liabilities relating to environmental, waste management or health and safety concerns.\n\nOur markets can be positively or negatively impacted by the effects of governmental and regulatory matters. We are affected not only by energy policy, laws, regulations and incentives of governments in the markets into which we sell, but also by rules, regulations and costs imposed by utilities. Utility companies or governmental entities could place barriers on the installation of our product or the interconnection of the product with the electric grid. Further, utility companies may charge additional fees to customers who install on-site power generation, thereby reducing the electricity they take from the utility, or for having the capacity to use power from the grid for back-up or standby purposes. These types of restrictions, fees or charges could hamper the ability to install or effectively use our products or increase the cost to our potential customers for using our systems in the future. This could make our systems less desirable, thereby adversely affecting our revenue and profitability potential. In addition, utility rate reductions can make our products less competitive which would have a material adverse effect on our future operations. These costs, incentives and rules are not always the same as those faced by technologies with which we compete. However, rules, regulations, laws and incentives could also provide an advantage to our Heat Recovery Solutions as compared with competing technologies if we are able to achieve required compliance at a lower cost when our Clean Cycle TM generators are commercialized. Additionally, reduced emissions and higher fuel efficiency could help our future customers combat the effects of global warming. Accordingly, we may benefit from increased government regulations that impose tighter emission and fuel efficiency standards.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nWe had no expenses in Research and Development costs during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**WHERE YOU CAN GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\n\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.

You can obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You can also access these reports and other filings electronically on the SEC’s web site, www.sec.gov.\n\n**Item 1a. Risk Factors.**\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. We reserve the right not to provide risk factors in our future filings. Our primary risk factors and other considerations include:\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n**RISKS ABOUT OUR BUSINESS**\n\n**OUR INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS HAVE ISSUED A GOING CONCERN OPINION AND IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND/OR REDUCE OUR OPERATING COSTS SUFFICIENTLY, WE MAY HAVE TO CURTAIL OPERATIONS AND MAY ULTIMATELY CEASE TO EXIST.**\n\n**Going Concern**\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a total stockholder’s equity of $5,869,198 and a working capital deficit of $1,949,206 and an accumulated deficit of $22,984,163 as of December 31, 2023 and used $4,783,077 in net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023. CETY has a clear strategy in place and has the capability to successfully restructure its existing debt and secure additional financing. With its current strategic approach and diversification of its products and solutions, the management has created a favorable environment for the company to transition towards profitability.\n\nFor the fiscal year closing on December 31, 2023, our company reported a net loss amounting to $5,659,723, to the net profit of $147,395 we achieved during the equivalent period in 2022. This downturn in profitability for 2023 can largely be attributed to several key factors: our strategic expansion which included the integration of two new business ventures, a rise in employee compensation and general overhead costs, diminished profit margins within our NG operations, significantly increased overhead expenses following our listing on NASDAQ, and a notable uptick in interest expenses and fees related to convertible debts and bridge loans, marking a higher interest expenditure compared to the previous year.\n\nFollowing the close of the 2022 fiscal year, the company’s equity for the fiscal year ending in 2023 saw a significant increase, rising from 1,878,196 to 5,869,198. This remarkable growth is primarily attributed to the success of the company’s public offering, which generated gross proceeds of $3.9 million, and conversion of some of its convertible notes into Series E preferred shares. Looking ahead, the company is poised for further growth with the anticipated launch of its biomass project in Vermont in 2024, which is expected to contribute to both profitability and growth. Additionally, the company’s ability to secure funding has been greatly enhanced following its listing on the Nasdaq on March 23, 2023. With a focus on optimizing operations and expanding global sales, management is confident in the company’s ability to sustain long-term profitability and maintain a strong capital position.\n\n**WE HAVE AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT AND MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES; THEREFORE, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING NEEDED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS.**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had current liabilities of $4,801526,297 and total current asset of 6,750,728.\n\nOur debt could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, or other purposes in the future, as needed; to plan for, or react to, changes in technology and in our business and competition; and to react in the event of an economic downturn.\n\nWe may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for required payments, or if we fail to comply with covenants in our revolving lines of credit, we will be in default.\n\n**WE ARE IN DEFAULT IN OUR OBLIGATIONS TO A MAJOR CREDITORS**\n\n**OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMICS, INCLUDING THE CORONAVIRUS OR COVID-19.**\n\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if a public health epidemic such as coronavirus or COVID-19 interferes with the ability of us, our employees, workers, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. We maintain offices in HaiXi with employees and workers upon whom we rely to, among other things, identify sources of supply in China, conduct factory inspections, place orders for merchandise, perform factory monitoring with respect to production, quality control and other requirements, and arrange shipping. A public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, poses the risk that we or our employees, workers, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. We face similar risks if a public health epidemic, including the coronavirus, affects other geographic areas where our employees, workers, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners are located.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n**IF DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT THE COMPANY OFFERS SLOWS, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.**\n\nDemand for products which it intends to sell depends on many factors, including:\n\n● | the economy, and in periods of rapidly declining economic conditions, customers may defer purchases or may choose alternate products;  \n---|---  \n● | the cost of oil, gas and solar energy;  \n● | the competitive environment in the heat to power sectors may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending;  \n● | our ability to maintain efficient, timely and cost-effective production and delivery of the products and services; and,  \n● | All of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for the products and services that we offer, which could adversely affect our sales, cash flows and overall financial condition.   \n  \n**WE OPERATE IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET. IF WE DO NOT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR PROSPECTS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.**\n\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive, with companies offering a variety of competitive products and services. We expect competition in our markets to intensify in the future as new and existing competitors introduce new or enhanced products and services that are potentially more competitive than our products and services. We believe many of our competitors and potential competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, ability to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products and services, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a larger number of suppliers, contract manufacturers, and channel partners, greater brand recognition, and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we do and the ability to offer financing for projects. Our competitors and potential competitors may also be able to develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours, achieve greater market acceptance of their products and services, and increase sales by utilizing different distribution channels than we do. Some of our competitors may aggressively discount their products and services in order to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, lost market share, or a failure to grow market share for us. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current or potential competitors, our prospects, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n**WE MAY LOSE OUT TO LARGER AND BETTER-ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS.**\n\nThe alternative power industry is intensely competitive. Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources as well as greater experience in the industry than we have. Our products may not be competitive with other technologies, both existing at the current time and in the future. If this happens, our sales and revenues will decline, or fail to develop at all. In addition, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with larger companies to gain access to greater development or marketing resources. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \n**OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.**\n\nOur international operations are exposed to the following risks, several of which are out of our control:\n\npolitical and economic instability, international terrorism and anti-American sentiment, particularly in emerging markets;\n\n● | preference for locally branded products, and laws and business practices favoring local competition;  \n---|---  \n● | unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulations, and unexpected changes to those laws or regulations;  \n● | |import and export license requirements, tariffs, taxes and other barriers;  \n● | costs of customizing products for foreign countries;  \n● | increased difficulty in managing inventory;  \n● | less effective protection of intellectual property; and  \n● | difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations.  \n  \nAny or all of these factors could adversely affect our ability to execute any geographic expansion strategies or have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n**OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE DISPLACED BY NEWER TECHNOLOGY.**\n\nThe alternative power industry is undergoing rapid and significant technological change. Third parties may succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than those developed or marketed by us, or that would make our technology obsolete or non-competitive. Accordingly, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to respond quickly to technological changes. We may not have the resources to do this.\n\n**WE MUST HIRE QUALIFIED ENGINEERING, DEVELOPMENT AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES PERSONNEL.**\n\nWe cannot be certain that we can attract or retain a sufficient number of highly qualified mechanical engineers, industrial technology and manufacturing process developers and professional services personnel. To deploy our products quickly and efficiently, and effectively maintain and enhance them, we will require an increasing number of technology developers. We expect customers that license our technology will typically engage our professional engineering staff to assist with support, training, consulting and implementation. We believe that growth in sales depends on our ability to provide our customers with these services and to attract and educate third-party consultants to provide similar services. As a result, we plan to hire professional services personnel to meet these needs. New technical and professional services personnel will require training and education and it will take time for them to reach full productivity. To meet our needs for engineers and professional services personnel, we also may use costlier third-party contractors and consultants to supplement our own staff. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly because our technology is specialized and only a limited number of individuals have acquired the needed skills. Additionally, we will rely on third-party implementation providers for these services. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with third-party implementation providers.\n\n**WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SHORTAGES OF REQUIRED COMPONENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS TO PROCURE OUR PARTS FOR PRODUCTION WHICH IF AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS BECOMES COMPROMISED IT COULD ADD TO OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD AND AFFECT OUR REVENUE GROWTH.**\n\nAt various times, there have been shortages of some of the components that we use, as a result of strong demand for those components or problems experienced by suppliers. These unanticipated component shortages have resulted in curtailed production or delays in production, which prevented us from making scheduled shipments to customers in the past and may do so in the future. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a reduction in our sales and an increase in our costs and could adversely affect our relationship with existing customers as well as prospective customers. Component shortages may also increase our cost of goods sold because we may be required to pay higher prices for components in short supply and redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate substitute components.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \n**OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, IN THE AGGREGATE, BENEFICIALLY OWN MORE THAN 50% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND THESE SHAREHOLDERS, IF ACTING TOGETHER, WILL BE ABLE TO EXERT SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER ALL MATTERS REQUIRING APPROVAL OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS _._**\n\nOur principal shareholders, directors and executive officers in the aggregate, beneficially own more than 50% our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. These shareholders, if acting together, will be able to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval of our shareholders, including amendments to our Articles of Incorporation, fundamental corporate transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, the sale of the company, and other matters involving the direction of our business and affairs and specifically the ability to determine the members of our board of directors. (See “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Managements”).\n\n**IF WE LOSE KEY SENIOR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL OUR BUSINESS COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. FURTHER, WE WILL NEED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL SKILLED MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO SO, OUR BUSINESS AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO GROW COULD BE HARMED.**\n\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive officers. We could be seriously harmed by the loss of any of our executive officers. In order to manage our growth, we will need to recruit and retain additional skilled management personnel and if we are not able to do so, our business and our ability to continue to grow could be harmed. Although a number of companies in our industry have implemented workforce reductions, there remains substantial competition for highly skilled employees.\n\n**WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE RISKS AND UNEXPECTED COSTS THAT WE MAY INCUR WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES, THE QUANTIFICATION OF WHICH CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME.**\n\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances in the ordinary course of our manufacturing process. If more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, or the results of future testing and analyses at our current or former operating facilities indicate that we are responsible for the release of hazardous substances, we may be subject to additional remediation liability. Further, additional environmental matters may arise in the future at sites where no problem is currently known or at sites that we may acquire in the future. Currently unexpected costs that we may incur with respect to environmental matters may result in additional loss contingencies, the quantification of which cannot be determined at this time.\n\n**OUR SALES AND CONTRACT FULFILLMENT CYCLES CAN BE LONG, UNPREDICTABLE AND VARY SEASONALLY, WHICH CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER.**\n\nThe timing of our sales and related customer contract fulfillment is difficult to predict. Many of our customers are large enterprises, whose purchasing decisions, budget cycles and constraints and evaluation processes are unpredictable and out of our control. Further, the timing of our sales is difficult to predict. The length of our sales cycle, from initial evaluation to payment for our products and services, can range from several months to well over a year and can vary substantially from customer to customer. Our sales efforts involve significant investment in resources in field sales, marketing and educating our customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our products and services. Customers often undertake a prolonged evaluation process. As a result, it is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale to a potential customer or if we can increase sales to our existing customers. Large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. In addition, the fulfillment of our customer contracts is partially dependent on other factors related to our customers’ businesses that are not in our control. as with the sales cycle, this can also cause revenues and earnings to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. If our sales and/or contract fulfillment cycles lengthen or our substantial upfront investments do not result in sufficient revenue to justify our investments, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced seasonal and end-of-quarter concentration of our transactions and variations in the number and size of transactions that close in a particular quarter, which impacts our ability to grow revenue over the long term and plan and manage cash flows and other aspects of our business and cost structure. Our transactions vary by quarter, with the fourth quarter typically being our largest. If expectations for our business turn out to be inaccurate, our revenue growth may be adversely affected over time and we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis and our cash flows may suffer.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**OUR OPERATING MARGINS MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT OF INCREASING PRODUCT COSTS.**\n\nOur business is subject to significant pressure on pricing and costs caused by many factors, including competition, the cost of components used in our products, labor costs, constrained sourcing capacity, inflationary pressure, pressure from customers to reduce the prices we charge for our products and services, and changes in consumer demand. Costs for the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are affected by, among other things, energy prices, consumer demand, fluctuations in commodity prices and currency, and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. Increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products or in the cost of labor and other costs of doing business in the United States and internationally could have an adverse effect on, among other things, the cost of our products, gross margins, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nOUR SALES AND PROFITABLITY OF OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN THE PRC ARE DEPENDANT ON THE PRICE OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS.\n\nOur Waste Heat Recovery products and Waste Recovery products are dependent on the prices of traditional energy sources. Our products reuse wasted heat and create electricity or reusable fuel. As the price of energy increases, the economic justification for our products increases. At the same time, as the price for traditional fuel decreases, there is less incentive for customers to purchase our products and it may impair our ability to sell our products.\n\nIF THE SPOT PRICE OF NG IN CHINA DROPS BELIOW THE PURCHASE PRICE OUR TRADERS NETOTIATE WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL OUR LNG OR MAY HAVE TO SELL IT AT A LOSS.\n\nOur traders at JHJ purchase NG at a fixed price in large volumes. If the spot prices for NG drop below our purchase price, we may not be able to sell our NG to our customers or may have to sell the NG at a substantial loss. We do not purchase a sufficient volume of LNG to be able to hedge against price declines of this commodity. If we believe that NG prices are too high and we are unable to purchase because we believe that prices will drop, we will not have sufficient supply of NG to conduct trading operations until the market pricing returns to a level at which we can conduct operations.\n\nWE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICENT FUNDS TO CONDUCT OUR TRADING OPERATIONS IN THE PRC.\n\nWe are funding our trading operations through cash flow generated by JHJ and from funds provided by our parent. If we or JHJ does not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to conduct trading operations.\n\nOUR WASTE TO ENERGY PRODUCTS FROM ENEX HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND DEPEND ON DATA OBTAINED FROM OPERATIONS IN THE UKRAINE AND RUSSIA.\n\nENEX’s HTAP 5 and 10 have not been installed in the United States. In order to commence sales, our purchasers will need to accept data from Russia or the Ukraine that they may not deem reliable. As a result we may be required to post large bonds or find an EPC that will guarantee performance of the ENEX systems. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to finance the bonds or find an EPC willing to guaranty performance.\n\nTHE IMPLEMENTAION OF OUR WASTE TO ENERGY JOINT VENTURES DEPENDS ON US FINDING FUNDING FO THE PROJECTS.\n\nIn order to implement the ENEX system in our waste to energy joint ventures, we will need to finance directly or obtain third party financing for these projects. We cannot give any assurances that we will be able to directly finance these projects or be able to find a third party to provide financing to them. If we are not able to finance the projects we will not be able to implement our business plan in this sector.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nPRC REGULATION OF LOANS TO AND DIRECT INVESTMENT IN PRC ENTITIES BY OFFSHORE HOLDING COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF CURRENCY CONVERSION MAY DELAY OR PREVENT US FROM MAKING LOANS OR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR CHINESE SUBSIDIARIES.\n\nWe are an offshore holding company conducting a portion of our operations in China. We may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries to the approval, registration, and filing with governmental authorities and limitation of amount, or we may make additional capital contributions to our subsidiaries in China and Hong Kong. Any loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries in China, which are treated as foreign-invested enterprises under PRC law, are subject to foreign exchange loan registrations\n\nIn light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals or filings on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future loans by us to our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries or with respect to future capital contributions by us to our Hong Kong or PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds from this Underwritten Offering and to capitalize or otherwise fund our Chinese operations may be negatively affected.\n\nFLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HAVE A AN EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR HONG KONG AND CHINA SUBSIDIARIES.\n\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions in China and by China’s foreign exchange policies. Since June 2010, the Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Renminbi has depreciated significantly in the backdrop of a surging U.S. dollar and persistent capital outflows of China. This depreciation halted in 2017, and the RMB appreciated approximately 7% against the U.S. dollar during this one-year period. With the development of the foreign exchange market and progress towards interest rate liberalization and Renminbi internationalization, the PRC government may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate system, and we cannot assure you that the Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the future which may impact the profitability of our operations in China.\n\nPRC REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFSHORE SPECIAL PURPOSE COMPANIES BY PRC DOMESTIC RESIDENTS MAY SUBJECT OUR PRC RESIDENT BENEFICIAL OWNERS TO PERSONAL LIABILITY, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INJECT CAPITAL INTO OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES, LIMIT OUR SUBSIDIARIES’ ABILITY TO INCREASE THEIR REGISTERED CAPITAL OR DISTRIBUTE PROFITS TO US, OR MAY OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT US.\n\nSAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75” promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 (the “SAFE Notice”) requires PRC residents to register with local branches of SAFE regarding their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle” (the “SPV”). SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. Under the SAFE Notice, failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth above could result in liability under Chinese law for foreign exchange evasion and may result in penalties and legal sanctions, including fines, the imposition of restrictions on a Chinese subsidiary’s foreign exchange activities and its ability to distribute dividends to the SPV, its ability to pay the SPV proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation in respect of the Chinese subsidiary and the SPV’s ability to contribute additional capital into or provide loans to the Chinese subsidiary. After consultation with China counsel, we do not believe that any of our PRC domestic resident stockholders are subject to the SAFE registration requirement. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all our stockholders who are PRC residents will not be required to make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by these SAFE regulations in the future. The failure or inability of our PRC resident stockholders to comply with the registration procedures set forth therein may subject us to fines and legal sanctions, restrict our cross-border investment activities, or limit our PRC subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends or obtain foreign-exchange-dominated loans to our company.\n\nAs it is uncertain how the SAFE regulations will be interpreted or implemented, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. For example, we may be subject to more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the SAFE regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \n**WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIRED TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL.**\n\nGrowing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. We have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations as sources of liquidity. If cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through equity or debt financing, to fund our growth. Our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions.\n\nIn addition, any equity securities we issue, including any preferred stock, may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the offering price per share of our Common Stock. The holders of any equity securities we issue, including any preferred stock, may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of Common Stock. If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business.\n\n**NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.**\n\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as fires, hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes; geo-political events, such as civil unrest in a country in which our suppliers are located or terrorist or military activities disrupting transportation, communication or utility systems; or other highly disruptive events, such as nuclear accidents, pandemics, unusual weather conditions or cyber-attacks, could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events could result, among other things, in operational disruptions, physical damage to or destruction or disruption of one or more of our properties or properties used by third parties in connection with the supply of products or services to us, the lack of an adequate workforce in parts or all of our operations and communications and transportation disruptions. These factors could also cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States and global financial markets and economy. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and could also have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.\n\n**WE HAVE ISSUED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES WHICH IF CONVERTED WILL SUBSTANTIALLY DILUTE ALL OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS.**\n\nWe have issued a substantial number of convertible securities which, if converted, would result in substantial dilution to our stockholders:\n\nConvertible Notes - and Approximate common share equivalents | 1,293,801  \n---|---  \nSeries E preferred shares | 1,857,590  \nWarrants and Common Stock equivalent’s | 70,104  \nTotal Convertible Common Stock equivalents | 2,376,821  \n  \n25  \n---  \n  \n**OUR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH FINANCINGS, ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS, OR OTHERWISE WILL DILUTE ALL OTHER STOCKHOLDERS.**\n\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies, and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.\n\n**WE MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE DILUTIVE TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, OUR LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN ACQUIRING OTHER BUSINESSES, PRODUCT LINES AND TECHNOLOGIES MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO OVERCOME PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ACQUISITIONS WE MAY UNDERTAKE.**\n\nWe intend to evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise, including business combinations, strategic partnerships, and the purchase, licensing or sale of assets. In connection with any such future transaction, we could issue dilutive equity securities, incur substantial debt, reduce our cash reserves or assume contingent liabilities.\n\nOur experience in acquiring other businesses, product lines and technologies is limited. Our inability to overcome problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions could divert the attention of management, utilize scarce corporate resources and otherwise harm our business. Any potential future acquisitions also involve numerous risks, including:\n\n● | problems assimilating the purchased operations, technologies or products;  \n---|---  \n● | costs associated with the acquisition;  \n● | adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;  \n● | risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;  \n● | potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations; and  \n● | potential litigation arising from the acquired company’s operations before the acquisition.  \n  \nFurthermore, acquisitions may require material charges and could result in adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges, in-process research and development charges, the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, any of which could negatively affect our results of operations.\n\n**WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS PARTICULAR TO OUR OPERATIONS WITH WHICH WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPLY.**\n\nWe may not be able to comply with all current and future government regulations which are applicable to our business. Our business operations are subject to all government regulations normally incident to conducting business (e.g., occupational safety and health acts, workmen’s compensation statutes, unemployment insurance legislation, income tax, and social security laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations, consumer safety laws and regulations, etc.) as well as to governmental laws and regulations applicable to small public companies and their capital formation efforts. Although we will make every effort to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we can provide no assurance of our ability to do so, nor can we predict the effect of those regulations on our proposed business activities. Our failure to comply with material regulatory requirements would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business and could result in our cessation of active business operations.\n\n**COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGING REGULATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES.**\n\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the public markets and public reporting. Our management team will need to invest significant management time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE DEPENDS PRIMARILY ON OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN.**\n\nWe may not be able to identify and maintain the necessary relationships within our industry. Our ability to execute our business plan also depends on other factors, including the ability to:\n\n1. Negotiate and maintain contracts and agreements with acceptable terms;\n\n2. Hire and train qualified personnel;\n\n3. Maintain marketing and development costs at affordable rates; and,\n\n4. Maintain an affordable labor force.\n\n**OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND SHARE PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AFTER THIS OFFERING MAY DROP BELOW THE PRICE YOU PAY.**\n\nOur quarterly operating results have in the past fluctuated and are likely to do so in the future. As a result, the trading price of the shares of our common stock following this offering is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Offering Circular, these factors include:\n\n● | the success of competitive products or technologies;  \n---|---  \n● | actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;  \n● | announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;  \n● | regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;  \n● | the recruitment or departure of key personnel;  \n---|---  \n● | the level of expenses;  \n● | changes in our backlog in a given period;  \n● | actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;  \n● | variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;  \n● | fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;  \n● | inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;  \n● | announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;  \n● | sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;  \n● | market conditions in the clean energy sector; and  \n● | general economic, industry and market conditions.  \n  \nThese and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, may cause our operating results and the market price and demand for our shares to fluctuate substantially. While we believe that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results, fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the market price and liquidity of our shares. In addition, the stock market in general, and companies in our markets in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of these risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these “Risk Factors,” could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of the shares of our common stock.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO SECURITIES LITIGATION, WHICH IS EXPENSIVE AND COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION.**\n\nThe market price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\n\n**Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.**\n\nNone.\n\n**Item 2. Properties.**\n\nOur corporate headquarters was located at 2990 Redhill Unit A, Costa Mesa, CA., which ended in November 2023. On March 10, 2016, the Company signed a lease agreement for a 18,200-square foot CTU Industrial Building. Lease term were seven years and two months beginning July 1, 2017. In October of 2018 we signed a sublease agreement with our facility in Italy with an indefinite term that may be terminated by either party with a 60-day notice for 1,000 Euro per month. Due to the short termination clause, we are treating this as a month-to-month lease.\n\nWe have relocated our corporate offices to 1340 Reynolds Avenue Unit 120, Irvine, CA 92614. On December 1, 2023, the Company signed a lease agreement for a 3000-square foot of office space with Metro Creekside California, LLC.

This location is used as CETY’s headquarters and coordination center for all domestic and global business units. On October 16 of 2023 we signed a sublease agreement to relocate the HRS operations from Costa Mesa to Irvine, California for one year and 7 months commencing December 1, 2023 and ending June 30, 2025. This location is used for Heat Recovery Solutions design, manufacturing, testing, and support. We also signed a temporary storage lease and Due to the short termination clause, we are treating this as a month-to-month lease. The lease payments for the years ending December 31, are:\n\nYear | Lease Payment  \n---|---  \n2023 | 401,293  \n  \nOur lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 was $401,293. and $349, 610, respectively, which also included common area maintenance.\n\nWe also maintain an 800 sq-ft R&D office located in Alanya city, within the Antalya region of Turkey. This facility is leased for a duration of two years, with payments made biannually. Our primary activities within this office include conducting marketing research for our CETY renewable business unit, facilitating sales operations, managing sourcing activities, and coordinating support for CETY’s engineering services.\n\nWe also operate offices in Chengdu, China, which serve as operational bases for our NG trading business and a gas storage and pumping station in Chengdu, China as well.\n\n**Item 3. Legal Proceedings.**\n\nFrom time to time, we may be party to litigation matters occurring in the ordinary course of our business. As of the date of this Annual Report, however, there are no material pending legal or governmental proceedings relating to our Company to which we are a party, and to our knowledge there are no material proceedings to which any of our directors, executive officers or affiliates are a party adverse to us or which have a material interest adverse to us.\n\n**Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures**\n\nNot Applicable.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**PART II**\n\n**Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.**\n\nBid and ask quotations for our common shares are routinely submitted by registered broker dealers who are members of the National Association of Securities Dealers on the NASD Over-the-Counter Electronic Bulletin Board. These quotations reflect inner-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not represent actual transactions.

The Company had a total stockholder’s equity of $5,869,198 and a working capital deficit of $1,949,205 and an accumulated deficit of $22,984,163 as of December 31, 2023 and used $4,783,077 in net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023. CETY has a clear strategy in place and has the capability to successfully restructure its existing debt and secure additional financing. With its current strategic approach and diversification of its products and solutions, the management has created a favorable environment for the company to transition towards profitability.\n\nFor the fiscal year closing on December 31, 2023, our company reported a net loss amounting to $5,531,762, to the net profit of $147,395 we achieved during the equivalent period in 2022. This downturn in profitability for 2023 can largely be attributed to several key factors: our strategic expansion which included the integration of two new business ventures, a rise in employee compensation and general overhead costs, diminished profit margins within our NG operations, significantly increased overhead expenses following our listing on NASDAQ, and a notable uptick in interest expenses and fees related to convertible debts and bridge loans, marking a higher interest expenditure compared to the previous year.\n\nFollowing the close of the 2022 fiscal year, the company’s equity for the fiscal year ending in 2023 saw a significant increase, rising from 1,878,196 to 5,111,982. This remarkable growth is primarily attributed to the success of the company’s public offering, which generated gross proceeds of $3.9 million, and conversion of some of its convertible notes into Series E preferred shares. Looking ahead, the company is poised for further growth with the anticipated launch of its biomass project in Vermont in 2024, which is expected to contribute to both profitability and growth. Additionally, the company’s ability to secure funding has been greatly enhanced following its listing on the Nasdaq on March 23, 2023. With a focus on optimizing operations and expanding global sales, management is confident in the company’s ability to sustain long-term profitability and maintain a strong capital position.\n\n**RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**\n\n**See note 13 to the notes to the financial statements for a discussion on related party transaction**\n\n**Results for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.**\n\n**Net Sales**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our total revenue was $15,113,463 compared to $2,663,212 for the same period in 2022. The Company has four reportable segments: Clean Energy HRS (HRS), CETY Europe and the engineering & manufacturing services division, CETY HK.\n\n**Segment breakdown**\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, our revenue from Engineering and Manufacturing amounted to $47,091, a decrease from $203,078 for the corresponding period in 2022. This decline can be attributed to the phased closure of our legacy manufacturing operations and a strategic reallocation of resources towards becoming a fully integrated clean energy solution provider, thereby strengthening support for our other technology segments.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue from HRS was $497,584 compared to $488,453 for the same period in 2022. However, we’re optimistic that the new government incentives will support an increase in revenue from our heat recovery solutions.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, our revenue from CETY Renewables, our newly launched waste-to-energy business, amounted to $429,999. There was no revenue generated from this segment in the preceding year.\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, our revenue from the NG business reached $14,138,789, a significant rise from $1,890,439 in the corresponding period of 2022. This substantial growth can be attributed to our enhanced capacity to secure additional NG allocations, coupled with the successful consolidation of our newly established joint venture.\n\n**Gross Profit**\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2023, our gross profit was $1,090,254, compared to $1,174,196 for the same period in 2022. It’s important to note that our gross profit margins can fluctuate due to a variety of factors, such as changes in production and supply chain efficiencies, material costs, logistics, and personnel expenses. The decrease in our gross profit for the year can be primarily attributed to the incorporation of additional revenue from our newly formed entity, CETY HK, which operates at lower margins.\n\n33  \n---  \n  \n**Segment breakdown.**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our gross profit from HRS was $157,179 compared to $459,362 for the same period in 2022, the decrease was due to lower revenue.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our gross profit from CETY Renewables was $392,298.\n\nFor the year ended December 31,2023, our gross profit from CETY HK was $594,041, compared to $631,082 for the same period in 2022.\n\n**Selling, General and Administrative (SG &A) Expenses**\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2023, our Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses amounted to $684,893, a rise from $400,322 in the corresponding period of 2022. This increase is largely due to enhanced spending across various sectors, notably in Media and Investor Relations, marketing, sales initiatives, the transition to a new facility, the launch of two new businesses, subscription services, and IT-related costs.\n\n**Salaries Expense**\n\nFor the fiscal year concluding on December 31, 2023, our total salaries expense amounted to $1,671,071, marking a significant increase from the previous year’s total of $782,657. The escalation in expenses for 2023 can be largely ascribed to the expansion of our team, including the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer, two directors responsible for operations and technology, four engineers, and additional personnel within our NG trading sector.\n\n**Travel Expense**\n\nFor the year concluding on December 31, 2023, our travel expenditure amounted to $405,334, in contrast to $166,025 for the corresponding timeframe in 2022. This increase in expenses is attributed to our efforts in expanding our business in Asia, specifically concerning the NG trading sector.\n\n**Facility Lease Expense**\n\nFor the fiscal year concluding on December 31, 2023, our Facility Lease expense totaled $401,293, as opposed to $349,610 for the corresponding period in 2022. This rise can be attributed to the addition of a new lease for our operations in China.\n\n**Consulting Expense**\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, our consulting expense amounted to $199,594, representing a notable increase from $119,896 recorded during the corresponding period in 2022. This rise can be attributed to the engagement of investor relations and marketing sub-contractors.\n\n**Bad Debt**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our bad debt expense was $0 compared to $0 for the same period in 2022.\n\n**Depreciation and Amortization Expense**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our depreciation and amortization expense was $26,692 compared to $30,076 for the same period in 2022.\n\n34  \n---  \n  \n**Professional fees legal and accounting**\n\nFor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, our Professional fees expense totaled $356,785, reflecting an uptick from $315,361 recorded during the same period in 2022. This increase in fees was primarily driven by elevated expenses associated with engaging a new auditor.\n\n**Net (Loss) from operations**\n\nFor the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2023, our net loss from operations amounted to $(2,655,408), a notable increase compared to the net loss from operations of $989,751 for the corresponding period in 2022. This rise in loss during 2023 can be attributed primarily to the expansion of our team, our uplisting to NASDAQ, and the expansion of our global business operations, as well as a decrease in margin revenue from our NG business.\n\n**Change in Derivative Liability**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a loss on derivative liability of $326,539 compared to a gain of $331,495 for the same period in 2022. The gain in derivative liability was from favorable derivative calculations and payoffs from several convertible notes.\n\n**Gain on debt settlement and write off**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had no gain on debt settlement.\n\n**Interest and Finance Fees**\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 interest and finance fees were $2,137,649 compared to $1,125,395 for the same period in 2022. The increase was mainly due to increase in additional convertible notes, bridge financing fees and interest, and additional a loss of 1,255,084 on convertible conversion preferred shares.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n**Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.**\n\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\nFor the years ended December 31,\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nNet Cash provided / (Used) In Operating Activities | $| 4,783,077 | $| (2,244,133| )  \nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities | (318,602| ) | (1,437,123| )  \nCash Flows Provided / (used) By Financing Activities | 5,096,483 | 2,798,885  \nNet (Decrease) Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents | $| 25,580 | $| (1,043,043| )  \n  \n35  \n---  \n  \n**Capital Requirements for long-term obligations**\n\n**None.**\n\n**_Critical Accounting Policies_**\n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\n\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, _“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”_ (“ASC 606”).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10_\n\nAn entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\na. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).\n\nb. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).\n\nc. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our business:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \n_Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-30_\n\nIf a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\n\nb. The customer has legal title to the asset\n\nc. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\n\nd. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\n\ne. The customer has accepted the asset\n\nThe core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)\n\n36  \n---  \n  \nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \nThe following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:\n\n● | We generate a quotation  \n---|---  \n● | We receive Purchase orders from our customers.  \n● | We build the product to their specification  \n● | We invoice at the time of shipment  \n● | The terms are typically Net 30 days  \n  \nThe following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:\n\n● | CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service.   \n---|---  \n  \n_A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):_\n\na. | A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer to the customer may not qualify.  \n---|---  \nb. | A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.  \nc. | A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer.  \n  \nIf the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.\n\nDuring the project development and engineering phase of our CETY Renewable projects such as VRG, we employ the input method of revenue recognition to estimate revenue based on projected costs. This approach involves forecasting future costs and revenues to determine the amount of revenue we recognize in the current period. It’s important to understand, however, that these recognized revenue figures are not final and are subject to adjustments. Changes may occur as we gain more clarity on actual costs compared to our initial projections, affecting the revenue recognized accordingly.\n\nThe projected costs of the VRG project is based on estimates and profitability will be impacted depending on actual costs. Using the input method for revenue recognition, the amount of recorded revenue is also affected depending on the estimated total costs. The purchase price allocation for Shuya was also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company. The inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company.\n\nAdditionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:\n\nBecause the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.\n\nIn recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.\n\n● | The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY and customer agree to a total EPC Contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.  \n---|---  \n  \nSecondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with the its agreement with its clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.\n\nCETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.\n\nCETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There are no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \nIn review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.\n\nIn reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.\n\nFinally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The compnpany adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20.\n\nFor CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nDuring the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.\n\nWe have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.\n\nAlso, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 we had $33,000 and 33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of year 2024.\n\nAlso from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding customer deposits of $210,310 and $80,475 respectively.\n\n**Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation**\n\nChengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (the “Xiangyueheng”), which owns a 10% equity interest in Shuya, entered a three-party Concerted Action Agreement (the “CAA”), wherein the parties agreed to vote in unison at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agreed that during the term of the CAA, before any of the three parties intends to propose motions to the shareholders’ meetings or the board of directors, or exercise their voting rights on any matter that shall be presented to and resolved through the shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the laws, regulations, Articles of Association of Shuya or any relevant shareholders’ agreements, the three parties will discuss, negotiate, and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.\n\nAs a result of the CAA, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (the “VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023.\n\n**Series E Valuation**\n\nAdditionally, the inputs for the valuation of the Series E preferred shares were also based on estimates and comparable data selected by the Company and fair value measurements, furthermore, the purchase price allocation was based on estimates of fair market values.\n\n**Future Financing**\n\nWe will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund planned acquisitions and exploration activities.\n\n**Off-balance Sheet Arrangement**\n\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.\n\n**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit, a working capital deficit and negative cash flows from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\n**Basis for Opinion**\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n**Critical Audit Matters**\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Auditing the valuation of the Series E preferred shares involved a high degree of auditor judgement and specialized skills and knowledge were needed._\n\n_Our audit procedures consisted of the following, among others:_\n\n●| We read the debt exchange agreement to understand and evaluate the terms of the transaction to determine that the number of Series E preferred shares issued and the total debt settled and recalculate the loss in extinguishment of debt based on the fair value of Series E preferred shares issued in 2023.  \n---|---  \n●| We obtained the Company’s third-party expert valuation report to gain an understanding of the processes and key assumptions for estimating the fair value of Series E preferred shares.  \n---|---  \n●| We utilized our valuation specialists to evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of the methodologies and assumptions used by the Company’s third-party valuation expert in developing the estimated fair value of Series E preferred shares.  \n---|---  \n  \nTAAD, LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\n\nDiamond Bar, California\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\n41  \n---  \n  \n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/ceff411554bd58f0ebbe7fe487ca8330-aud_001.jpg)\n\n**REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM**\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.\n\n**Opinion on the Financial Statements**\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“the Company”) as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements).

According to our Framework Agreement with Shenzhen Gas, we will be required to contribute $8 million to the joint venture. The terms of the joint venture are subject to the execution of definitive agreements.\n\n**NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:**\n\nA summary of significant accounting policies of Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (formerly Probe Manufacturing, Inc.) is presented to assist in the understanding of the Company’s financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management, who is responsible for their integrity and objectivity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n**Estimates**\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates may be materially different from actual financial results. Significant estimates include the recoverability of long-lived assets, the collection of accounts receivable and valuation of inventory and reserves.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents**\n\nWe maintain most of our cash accounts at a commercial bank. The total cash balance is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000, (which we may exceed from time to time) per commercial bank. For the purposes of the statement of cash flows we consider all cash and highly liquid investments with initial maturities of one year or less to be cash equivalents.\n\n**Accounts Receivable**\n\nOur ability to collect receivables is affected by economic fluctuations in the geographic areas and industries served by us. Reserves for uncollectable amounts are provided, based on past experience and a specific analysis of the accounts. Although we expect to collect amounts due, actual collections may differ from the estimated amounts. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable accounts receivable of $95,000 and $95,000. Our policy for reserves for our long-term financing receivables is determined on a contract-by-contract basis and considers the length of the financing arrangement. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had a reserve for potentially un-collectable long-term financing receivables of $247,500 and $247,500 respectively.\n\nSeven (7) customers accounted for approximately 98% of accounts receivable on December 31, 2023. Our trade accounts primarily represent unsecured receivables. Historically, our bad debt write-offs related to these trade accounts have been insignificant. Four (4) customers accounted for approximately 98% of accounts receivable on December 31, 2023. Our trade accounts primarily represent unsecured receivables.\n\n48  \n---  \n  \n**Inventory**\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market value. Our industry experiences changes in technology, changes in market value and availability of raw materials, as well as changing customer demand. We make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventories based on regular audits and cycle counts of our on-hand inventory levels and forecasted customer demands and at times additional provisions are made. Any inventory write offs are charged to the reserve account. As of December 31, 2023 we had a reserve of $934,344 vs. reserve of $897,808 as of December, 2022.\n\n**Property and Equipment**\n\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Assets held under capital leases are recorded at lease inception at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the related assets. The cost of ordinary maintenance and repairs is charged to operations. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES\n\nFurniture and fixtures 3 to 5 years\n\nEquipment 5 to 10 years\n\n**Long – Lived Assets**\n\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, and operating lease right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nRecoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets. Fair value is generally determined using the asset’s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable.\n\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its long-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” ASC 360-10-15 requires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals. There was no impairment of long-lived assets for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASU No. 2014-09, _“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”_ (“ASC 606”).\n\n_Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-27 through 25-29, 25-36 through 25-37, 55-5 through 55-10_\n\nAn entity transfers control of a good or service over time and satisfies a performance obligation and recognizes revenue over time if one of the following criteria is met:\n\na. The customer receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-5 through 55-6).\n\nb. The entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example, work in process) that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-55-7).\n\nc. The entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity (see FASB ASC 606-10-25-28), and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date (as described in FASB ASC 606-10-25-29).\n\n49  \n---  \n  \n_Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time_\n\n_FASB ASC 606-10-25-30_\n\nIf a performance obligation is not satisfied over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity should consider the guidance on control in FASB ASC 606-10-25-23 through 25-26. In addition, it should consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. The entity has a present right to payment for the asset\n\nb. The customer has legal title to the asset\n\nc. The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset\n\nd. The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset\n\ne. The customer has accepted the asset\n\nThe core principle of the revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods and services transferred to the customer. In addition, a) the company also does not have an alternative use for the asset if the customer were to cancel the contract, and b) has a fully enforceable right to receive payment for work performed (i.e., customers are required to pay as various milestones and/or timeframes are met)\n\nThe following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle for our HRS and Cety Europe Divisions:\n\n● | Identify the contract with the customer  \n---|---  \n● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Determine the transaction price  \n● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract  \n● | Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation  \n  \nThe following steps are applied to our legacy engineering and manufacturing division:\n\n● | We generate a quotation  \n---|---  \n● | We receive Purchase orders from our customers.  \n● | We build the product to their specification  \n● | We invoice at the time of shipment  \n● | The terms are typically Net 30 days  \n  \nThe following step is applied to our CETY HK business unit:\n\n● | CETY HK is primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract / promise to provide the specified good or service.   \n---|---  \n  \n_A principal obtains control over any one of the following (ASC 606-10-55-37A):_\n\na. | A good or another asset from the other party which the entity then transfers to the customer. Note that momentary control before transfer to the customer may not qualify.  \n---|---  \nb. | A right to a service to be performed by the other party, which gives the entity the ability to direct that party to provide the service to the customer on the entity’s behalf.  \nc. | A good or service from the other party that it then combines with other goods or services in providing the specified good or service to the customer.  \n  \nIf the entity obtains control over one of the above before the good or service is transferred to a customer, the entity could be considered a principal.\n\n50  \n---  \n  \nAdditionally, the above five steps are applied to achieve core principle for our CETY Renewables Division:\n\nBecause the CETY Renewables division is presently engaged in the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) of biomass power facilities, CETY Renewables has developed a process of executing EPC Agreements with customers for this work. In contracting these engagements, CETY Renewables recognizes revenue according to accounting standards in accordance with ASC 606.\n\nIn recognizing this revenue, CETY Renewables first identifies the relevant contract with its customer according to 606-10-25-1.\n\n● | The entities, together known as the Parties, approved the contract in writing, through signatures and commitment to the performance of permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY’s work product includes permits, engineering designs, equipment, and full balance of plant specific to permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.  \n---|---  \n● | CETY and customer agree to a total EPC Contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | The contract has commercial substance. The risk associated with this EPC Agreement is that payment of the EPC contract price.  \n---|---  \n● | Per the EPC Agreement, CETY expects to collect substantially all of the consideration for its goods and services.  \n---|---  \n  \nSecondly, CETY identifies the performance obligations of the Parties in performance of the EPC Agreement in accordance with 606-10-25-14. At contract inception, CETY assesses the goods and services necessary to deliver the facility in accordance with its agreement with clients. The agreement specifically laid out all deliverables necessary to achieve the permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning.\n\nCETY also looks at 606-10-25-14(A). A bundle of goods or services is also present, in that CETY is delivering all work products associated with permitting, design, procurement, construction and commissioning of a commercially operable biomass power plant. A biomass power plant is a distinct bundle of goods or services, so the individual goods or services on their own do not lend themselves to a fully integrated or functional system.\n\nCETY in accordance with 606-10-32-1, CETY reviews measurement of the performance obligations. There is no exclusion of any amount of the Contract Price due to constraints associated with 606-10-31-11 through 606-10-32-13.\n\nIn review of 606-10-32-2A, CETY did not exclude measurement from the measurement of the transaction price any taxes assessed by a government authority as no such taxes will be due.\n\nIn reviewing 606-10-32-3, CETY evaluated the nature, timing, and amount of consideration promised, and whether it impacts the estimate of the transaction price.\n\nFinally, in identifying a single method of measuring progress for each performance obligation satisfied over time, in accordance with 606-10-25-32, CETY applies the methodology of 606-10-25-36. CETY adopted and implemented the input method for revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606-10-25-33. The company adopts the input method for implementation. CETY recognizes revenue for performance obligations on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation per 606-10-55-20. \n\nFor CETY, the contracts with clients for the construction of biomass power plants are the basis for revenue recognition. In each separate EPC Agreement, the performance obligations include permitting, design, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the plant. All of these work products satisfy Section 606-10-25-27(b) as these work products create or enhance an asset under customer’s control. Upon delivery of the work product, the customer takes control of the work products and has full right and ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of the assets. We recognize revenue over time, using timeline and milestone methods to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.\n\nDuring the complexity and duration of the biomass power plant construction projects, CETY will recognize revenue over time, consistent with the criteria for over-time recognition under ASC 606. This approach reflects the continuous transfer of documents, permits, and the equipment over to the customer, which is characteristic of long-term construction contracts.\n\nWe have a list of appropriate measures of progress: This is based on milestones achieved, among other measures.\n\nGiven the long-term nature of the projects, CETY regularly reviews and, if necessary, updates its estimates of progress towards completion, transaction price, and the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations.\n\nAlso, from time to time our contracts state that the customer is not obligated to pay a final payment until the units are commissioned, i.e. a final payment of 10%. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 we had $33,000 and 33,000 of deferred revenue, which is expected to be recognized in the second quarter of year 2024.\n\nAlso from time to time we require upfront deposits from our customers based on the contract. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had outstanding customer deposits of $210,310 and $80,475 respectively.\n\n51  \n---  \n  \n**Fair Value of Financial instruments**\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 820-10 (SFAS No. 157), “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” for financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that the Company uses to measure fair value:\n\n● | Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  \n---|---  \n● | Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities.  \n● | Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company’s derivative liabilities have been valued as Level 3 instruments. We value the derivative liability using a lattice model, with a volatility of 56% and using a risk free interest rate of 0.15%  \n  \nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, prepaid expenses, inventory, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and convertible notes payable. The estimated fair value of cash, prepaid expenses, investments, accounts payable, accrued expenses and convertible notes payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n**Foreign Currency Translation and Comprehensive Income (Loss)**\n\nWe have no material components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods. The accounts of the Company’s Chinese entities are maintained in RMB. The accounts of the Chinese entities were translated into USD in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters.” All assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date; stockholders’ equity is translated at historical rates and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income.” Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are reflected in the statements of operations.\n\nThe Company follows FASB ASC Topic 220-10, “Comprehensive Income (loss).” Comprehensive income (loss) comprises net income (loss) and all changes to the statements of changes in stockholders’ equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in additional paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders.\n\n52  \n---  \n  \n**Change from fair value or equity method to consolidation.**\n\nIn July 2022, JHJ, a wholly owned subsidiary of CETY HK and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHK owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022, JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; Right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya.\n\nShuya was set up as the operating entity for pipeline natural gas (PNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) trading business, while the other two shareholders of Shuya have large supply relationships.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has determined that Shuya is not a VIE and has evaluated its consolidation analysis under the voting interest model. Because the Company does not own greater than 50% of the outstanding voting shares, either directly or indirectly, it has accounted for its investment in Shuya under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the investor (“JHJ”) recognizes its share of the profits and losses of the investee (“Shuya”) in the periods when these profits and losses are also reflected in the accounts of the investee. Any profit or loss recognized by the investing entity appears in its income statement. Also, any recognized profit increases the investment recorded by the investing entity, while a recognized loss decreases the investment.\n\nJHJ made an investment of RMB 3.91 million ($0.55 million) into Shuya during the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 recorded in accordance with ASC 323. Shuya had a net loss of approximately $10,750 during the year ending December 31, 2022, of which approximately $5000 was allocated to the company, reducing the investment by that amount.\n\nChengdu Xiangyueheng Enterprise Management Co., Ltd (the “Xiangyueheng”), which owns a 10% equity interest in Shuya, entered a three-party Concerted Action Agreement (the “CAA”), wherein the parties agreed to vote in unison at the shareholders’ meeting of Shuya to consolidate the controlling position of the three parties in Shuya. The three parties agreed that during the term of the CAA, before any of the three parties intends to propose motions to the shareholders’ meetings or the board of directors, or exercise their voting rights on any matter that shall be presented to and resolved through the shareholders’ meeting in accordance with the laws, regulations, Articles of Association of Shuya or any relevant shareholders’ agreements, the three parties will discuss, negotiate, and coordinate the motion topics for consistency; in the event of disagreement, the opinions of JHJ shall prevail.\n\nAs a result of the CAA, the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (the “VIE”) of JHJ because 1) the equity investors at risk, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and 2) Shuya is structured with disproportionate voting rights, and substantially all the activities are conducted on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights. Under ASC 810, a reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, and must consolidate that VIE, if the reporting entity has both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance; and (b) the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits, that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company concluded JHJ is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023.\n\nThe change of control interest was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, referred to as ASC, 805, Business Combinations. The management determined that the Company was the acquiror for financial accounting purposes. In identifying the Company as the accounting acquiror, the companies considered the structure of the transaction and other actions contemplated by the Three-Parties Consistent Action Agreement, relative outstanding share ownership and market values, the composition of the combined company’s board of directors, the relative size of Shuya, and the designation of certain senior management positions of the combined company.\n\n53  \n---  \n  \nIn accordance with ASC 805, the Company recorded the acquisition based on the fair value of the consideration transferred and then allocated the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of the value of consideration transferred over the aggregate fair value of those net assets was recorded as goodwill. Any identified definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives and any identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The valuation of purchase considerations was based on preliminary estimates that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Based on the preliminary independent valuation, management determined that the difference in the fair value of the consideration paid, and book records was immaterial due to the fact that Shuya has been only in operations for less than a year after effective date of control in became effective. The management determined that the final purchase price allocation shall be re-valuated subject to change pending additional operational results and forecast assumptions.\n\nAs the Consistent Action Agreement did not quantify any considerations to gain the control, the deemed consideration paid is the fair value of 51% non-controlling interest as of January 1, 2023. The following table summarizes the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on January 1, 2023, the acquisition date.\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED\n\nFair value of non-controlling interests | $| 650,951  \n---|---|---  \nFair value of previously held equity investment | 556,096  \nSubtotal | $| 1,207,047  \nRecognized value of 100% of identifiable net assets | (1,207,047| )  \nGoodwill Recognized | $| -  \nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (preliminary):  \nInventories | $| 516,131  \nCash and cash equivalents | 50,346  \nTrade and other receivables | 952,384  \nAdvanced deposit | 672,597  \nNet fixed assets | 6,704  \nTrade and other payables | (1,021,897| )  \nAdvanced payments | (5,317| )  \nSalaries and wages payables | (4,692| )  \nOther receivable | 40,791  \nTotal identifiable net assets | $| 1,207,047  \n  \nUnder ASC-805-10-50-2, initial consolidation of an investee previously reported using fair value or the equity method should be accounted for prospectively as of the date the entity obtained a controlling financial interest.

This Statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instruments, which includes grants of stock options and stock warrants, based on the fair value of the award, measured at the grant date (with limited exceptions). Under this standard, the fair value of each award is estimated on the grant date, using an option-pricing model that meets certain requirements. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of our equity awards, including stock options and warrants. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of SFAS No. 123R; however, the fair values generated may not reflect their actual fair values, as it does not consider certain factors, such as vesting requirements, employee attrition and transferability limitations. The Black-Scholes model valuation is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We estimate the expected volatility and estimated life of our stock options at grant date based on historical volatility. For the “risk-free interest rate,” we use the Constant Maturity Treasury rate on 90-day government securities. The term is equal to the time until the option expires. The dividend yield is not applicable, as the Company has not paid any dividends, nor do we anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. The fair value of our restricted stock is based on the market value of our free trading common stock, on the grant date calculated using a 20-trading-day average. At the time of grant, the share-based compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest using historical employee attrition rates and the expense is reduced accordingly. It is also adjusted to account for the restricted and thinly traded nature of the shares. The expense is reviewed and adjusted in subsequent periods if actual attrition differs from those estimates.\n\nWe re-evaluate the assumptions used to value our share-based awards on a quarterly basis and, if changes warrant different assumptions, the share-based compensation expense could vary significantly from the amount expensed in the past. We may be required to adjust any remaining share-based compensation expense, based on any additions, cancellations or adjustments to the share-based awards. The expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award—the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 we had $0 in share-based expense, due to the issuance of common stock. As of December 31, 2023, we had no further non-vested expense to be recognized.\n\n**Leases**\n\nOn January 2, 2020, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, or ASC 842, using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect adjustment to be accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019, and accordingly, modified its policy on accounting for leases as stated below. As described under “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements,” below, the primary impact of adopting ASC 842 for the Company was the recognition in the consolidated balance sheet of certain lease-related assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms longer than 12 months.\n\nThe Company’s leases primarily consist of facility leases which are classified as operating leases. The Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company recognizes a lease liability to make contractual payments under all leases with terms greater than twelve months and a corresponding right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term using the collateralized incremental borrowing rate since the implicit rate is unknown. Options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such an option. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the contractual lease liability plus any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made, less any lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLeased right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing as a long-lived asset at the asset-group level. The Company monitors its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. As the Company’s leased right-of-use assets primarily relate to facility leases, early abandonment of all or part of facility as part of a restructuring plan is typically an indicator of impairment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company tests whether the carrying amount of the leased right-of-use asset is recoverable including consideration of sublease income, and if not recoverable, measures impairment loss for the right-of-use asset or asset group.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nFederal Income taxes are not currently due since we have had losses since inception of Clean Energy Technologies.\n\n57  \n---  \n  \nOn December 22, 2018 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. Among the significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Tax Act lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate (“Federal Tax Rate”) from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The Company will compute its income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 using a Federal Tax Rate of 21% and an estimated state of California rate of 9%.\n\nIncome taxes are provided based upon the liability method of accounting pursuant to ASC 740-10-25 _Income Taxes – Recognition._ Under this approach, deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than not” standard required by ASC 740-10-25-5.\n\nDeferred income tax amounts reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $(15,737,415) and a deferred tax asset of $4,727,224 using the statutory rate of 30%. The deferred tax asset may be recognized in future periods, not to exceed 20 years. However, due to the uncertainty of future events we have booked valuation allowance of $(4,727,224). FASB ASC 740 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FASB ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. At December 31, 2023 the Company had not taken any tax positions that would require disclosure under FASB ASC 740.\n\nOn February 13, 2018, Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Registrant” or “Corporation”) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement (“Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and between MGW Investment I Limited (“MGWI”) and the Corporation. The Corporation received $907,388 in exchange for the issuance of 7,561,567 restricted shares of the Corporation’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Common Stock”).\n\nOn February 13,2018 the Corporation and Confections Ventures Limited. (“CVL”) entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Convertible Note Purchase Agreement,” together with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder, the “Financing”) pursuant to which the Corporation issued to CVL a convertible promissory Note (the “CVL Note”) in the principal amount of $939,500 with an interest rate of 10% per annum interest rate and a maturity date of February 13, 2020. The CVL Note is convertible into shares of Common Stock at $0.12 per share, as adjusted as provided therein. This note was assigned to MGW Investments.\n\nThis resulted in a change in control, which limited the net operating to that date forward. We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and the states of California. Further, the Company currently has no open tax years’ subject to audit prior to December 31, 2018. The Company is current on its federal and state tax returns.\n\n**Reclassification**\n\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported income, total assets, or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.\n\n58  \n---  \n  \n**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**\n\nThe Company’s management reviewed all recently issued ASU’s not yet adopted by the Company and does not believe the future adoptions of any such ASU’s may be expected to cause a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or the results of its operations.\n\n**Deferred Stock Issuance Costs**\n\nDeferred stock issuance costs represent amounts paid for legal, consulting, and other offering expenses in conjunction with the future raising of additional capital to be performed within one year. These costs are netted against additional paid-in capital as a cost of the stock issuance upon closing of the respective stock placement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, $11,000 of deferred stock issuance costs will capitalized and will be recognized upon the funding of the offering during the year 2024.\n\n**NOTE 3 – ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE**\n\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nAccounts Receivable | $| 1,362,130 | $| 1,388,567  \nAccounts Receivable - RP | 491,774 | -  \nLess reserve for uncollectable accounts | (95,000| ) | (95,000| )  \nTotal | $| 1,758,904 | $| 1,293,567  \n  \nOur Accounts Receivable is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\nSCHEDULE OF LEASE RECEIVABLE ASSET\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nLong-term receivables | $ | 1,149,854 | $ | 1,000,000  \nLess reserve for uncollectable accounts | (247,500 | ) | (247,500 | )  \nNet Long-term receivables | 902,354 | 752,500  \n  \n**T** he Company is currently modifying the assets subject to lease to meet the provisions of the agreement, and as of December 31, 2023 any collection on the lease payments was not yet considered probable, resulting in no derecognition of the underlying asset and no net lease investments recognized on the sales-type lease pursuant to ASC 842-30-25-3.\n\nOn a contract by contract basis or in response to certain situations or installation difficulties, the Company may elect to allow non-interest bearing repayments in excess of 1 year.\n\nOur long - term financing Receivable are pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n59  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 4 – INVENTORY**\n\nInventories by major classification were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INVENTORIES\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nInventory | $| 1,909,238 | $| 1,389,394  \nLess reserve for obsolescence parts | (934,344| ) | (897,808| )  \nTotal | $| 974,894 | $| 500,586  \n  \nOur Inventory is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 5 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nProperty and equipment were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nProperty and Equipment | $| 1,509,025 | $| 1,430,260  \nAccumulated Depreciation | (1,430,337| ) | (1,415,444| )  \nNet Fixed Assets | $| 78,688 | $| 14,816  \n  \nOur Depreciation Expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $26,692 and $30,076 respectively.\n\nOur Property Plant and Equipment is pledged to Nations Interbanc, our line of credit.\n\n**NOTE 6 – INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\nIntangible assets were comprised of the following at:\n\nSCHEDULE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nDecember 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022  \n---|---  \nGoodwill | $| 747,976 | $| 747,976  \nLWL Investment | 1,468,709 | 1,468,709  \nIntangible assets - Shuya | 12,914 | -  \nLicense | 354,322 | 354,322  \nPatents | 190,789 | 190,789  \nAccumulated Amortization | (98,972| ) | (87,096| )  \nNet Fixed Assets | $| 26,82,893 | $| 2,674,700  \n  \nOur Amortization Expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $11,876 and 11,876 respectively.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis of the facts surrounding the Company’s acquisition of LWL, it is the Company’s position that the Company is the acquirer of LWL, under the acquisition method of accounting.\n\nAs such, as of November 8, 2021 (the acquisition date), the Company recognized, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the Business combination.\n\nThe following table presents the purchase price allocation:\n\nSCHEDULE OF BUSINESS ACQUISITION PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION\n\nConsideration:  \n---  \nTotal purchaser consideration – cash paid | $| 1,500,000  \nAssets acquired:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 6,156  \nPrepayment | $| 13,496  \nOther receivable | $| 20,000  \nTrading Contracts | $| 146,035  \nShenzhen Gas Relationship | $| 1,314,313  \nTotal assets acquired | $| 1,508,539  \nLiabilities assumed:  \nAdvance Receipts | $| (8,539| )  \nTaxes Payable | $| 179  \nNet Assets Acquired: | $| 1,500,000  \n  \nIf LWL reach USD 5 million in revenue or net profit of USD 1 million by December 31, 2023, then based on the performance contingency there will be issuance of 500,000 shares of CETY to the Seller.As of the date of the filing the performance contingencies had not been met.\n\n60  \n---  \n  \n**NOTE 7 – CONVERTIBLE NOTE RECEIVABLE**\n\nEffective January 10, 2022, JHJ (“note holder”) entered a convertible note agreement with Chengdu Rongjun Enterprise Consulting Co., Ltd (“Rongjun” or “the borrower”) with maturity on January 10, 2025.

Given that the values of the assets were different than GE’s internal reports and as we discussed at the time of the transaction with GE’s management, we proposed a change in the amount the Company owes GE under the purchase agreement, but GE was non-responsive and GE’s entire distributed power vertical has been divested.\n\nBased on the California Statute of Limitations, the Nevada Statute of Limitations, and the New York Statute of Limitations it is the view of our legal counsel that the above referenced debt is no longer an enforceable obligation. under California law, Nevada law, and New York law, as it became past due no later than November 3, 2016, more than Six (6) years ago and last payment made on the debt was on November 3, 2016, which is more than Six (6) years ago.

For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but has been updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We have adopted the above ASU as of January 1, 2019.

In addition the company established CETY Renewables Ashfield LLC (“CRA”) a wholly owned subsidiary of Ashfield Renewables Ag Development LLC(“ARA”) with our partner, Ashfield AG (“AG”). The purpose of the joint venture was the development of a pyrolysis plant established to convert woody feedstock into electricity and BioChar by using high temperature ablative fast pyrolysis reactor for which Clean Energy Technology, Inc. holds the license for. The CRA was located in Ashfield, Massachusetts. Based upon the terms of the members’ agreement, the CETY Capital LLC owned 75% interest and AG owns a 25% interest in Ashfield Renewables Ag Development LLC. The agreement with CETY Renewables Ashfield has been terminated and CETY Renewable Ashfield was dissolved.\n\n74  \n---  \n  \nThe consolidated financial statements have deconsolidated the CRA business unit. The Liabilities of CRA has been transferred to Vermont Renewable Gas LLC (“VRG”), a newly formed entity. CETY retains 49% equity in VRG.\n\nOn April 2, 2023 the Company formed CETY Capital LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of CETY. In addition, the company established Vermont Renewable Gas LLC (“VRG”) with our partner, Synergy Bioproducts Corporation (“SBC”) The purpose of the joint venture is the development of a pyrolysis plant established to convert wood feedstock into electricity and BioChar by using high temperature ablative fast pyrolysis reactor for which Clean Energy Technology, Inc. holds the license for. The VRG is in Lyndon, Vermont. Based upon the terms of the members’ agreement, CETY Capital LLC owns a 49% interest and SBC owns a 51% interest in Vermont Renewable Gas LLC.\n\nThe Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Company analyzed the transaction under ASC 810 Consolidation, to determine if the joint venture classifies as a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). The Joint Venture qualifies as a VIE based on the fact the JV does not have sufficient equity to operate without financial support from both parties. According to ASC 810-25-38, a reporting entity shall consolidate a VIE when that reporting entity has a variable interest (or combination of variable interests) that provides the reporting entity with a controlling financial interest on the basis of the provisions in paragraphs 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J. The reporting entity that consolidates a VIE is called the primary beneficiary of that VIE. According to the JV operating agreement, the ownership interests are 49/51 and the agreement provides for a Management Committee of 3 members. Two of the three members are from Synergy Bioproducts Corporation, and one is from CETY. Both parties do not have substantial capital at risk and CETY does not have voting interest. However, SBC has controlling interest and more board votes therefore SBC is the beneficiary of the VIE and as a result we record it as an equity investment. Accordingly, the Company has elected to account for the joint venture as an equity method investment in accordance with ASC 323 Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures. This decision is a result of the company’s evaluation of its involvement with potential variable interest entities and their respective risk and reward scenarios, which collectively affirm that the conditions necessitating the application of the variable interest model are not present.\n\nIn July 2022 JHJ and other three shareholders agreed to form and make total capital contribution of RMB 20 million ($2.81 million) with latest contribution due date in February 2066 into Sichuan Hongzuo Shuya Energy Limited (“Shuya”), JHJ owns 20% of Shuya. In August 2022 JHJ purchased 100% ownership of Sichuan Shunengwei Energy Technology Limited (“SSET”) for $0, who owns 29% of Shuya; Shunengwei is a holding company and did not have any operations nor made any capital contribution into Shuya as of the ownership purchase date by JHJ; right after the ownership purchase of SSET, JHJ ultimately owns 49% of Shuya. As a result of Consistent Action Agreement entered on December 31, 2022 the Company re-analyzed and determined that Shuya is the variable interest entity (“VIE”) of JHJ, and the Company consolidates Shuya into its consolidated financial statements effective on January 1, 2023. The non-controlling interest of Shuya represents the 41% equity ownership that is owned by Leishen, and 10% equity ownership owned by another shareholder.\n\n**NOTE 16 – INCOME TAX**\n\nCETY Europe\n\nCETY Europe is one of the Company’s subsidiaries in Italy, and is subject to 24% corporate income tax rate.\n\nHong Kong\n\nCETY HK is incorporated in Hong Kong and is subject to Hong Kong Profits Tax on the taxable income as reported in its statutory financial statements adjusted in accordance with relevant Hong Kong tax laws. The applicable tax rate for the first HKD 2 million of assessable profits is 8.25% and assessable profits above HKD$2 million will continue to be subject to the rate of 16.5% for corporations in Hong Kong, effective from the year of assessment 2018/2019.\n\nCETY HK did not make any provisions for Hong Kong profit tax as there were no assessable profits derived from or earned in Hong Kong since inception.\n\nPRC\n\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) Law of the PRC, domestic enterprises and Foreign Investment Enterprises (the “FIE”) are usually subject to a unified 25% EIT rate while preferential tax rates, tax holidays, and even tax exemption may be granted on case-by-case basis. From January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024, small and low-profit enterprises with annual taxable income exceeding RMB 1 million but not more than RMB 3 million, the actual income to be taxed will be at 25% of annual taxable income, and the corporate income tax is paid at the rate of 20%.\n\nThe current PRC EIT Law imposes a 10% withholding income tax for dividends distributed by foreign invested enterprises to their immediate holding companies outside the PRC. A lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between the PRC and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company. Distributions to holding companies in Hong Kong that satisfy certain requirements specified by the PRC tax authorities, for example, will be subject to a 5% withholding tax rate.\n\nThe provision for income tax consisted of the following:\n\nSCHEDULE OF PROVISION OF INCOME TAX\n\nFor the year ended December 31,2023  \n---  \nCurrent income tax expense | $| 22,173  \nDeferred income tax expense (benefit) | -  \nTotal income tax expense | $| 22,173  \n  \n75  \n---  \n  \nThe following table reconciles the statutory tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate:\n\nSCHEDULE OF RECONCILIATION OF STATUTORY TAX RATE\n\nFor the year ended December 31,2023  \n---  \nFederal statutory tax expense (benefit) | (21| )%  \nState statutory | (6.8| )%  \nTax rate difference | 0.1| %  \nPermanent difference | 0.2| %  \nChange in valuation allowance | (28.0| )%  \nEffective tax rate | 0.4| %  \n  \nThe components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nAs of December 31, 2023  \n---  \nDeferred tax:  \nAllowance for doubtful accounts | $| 5,686  \nNet operating loss (“NOL”) carrying forwards | 7,021,555  \nOperating lease liabilities, net of right of use assets | 2,479  \nAdvertising expense  \nTotal deferred tax assets, net | 7,029,720  \nLess: valuation allowance | (7,029,720| )  \nTotal deferred tax assets, net | —  \n  \nThe Company evaluates its valuation allowance requirements at end of each reporting period by reviewing all available evidence, both positive and negative, and considering whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. When circumstances cause a change in management’s judgement about the realizability of deferred tax assets, the impact of the change on the valuation allowance is generally reflected in income from operations. The future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carry forward period available under applicable tax law. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s PRC operating entities had $0.35 million net operating loss that can be carried forward to offset future taxable income for five years from the year the loss is incurred; the Company’s US parent had $30.08 million net operating loss that can be carried forward, for federal income tax purposes, NOLs arising in tax years beginning after 2017 may only reduce 80% of a taxpayer’s taxable income and may be carried forward indefinitely; for California income tax purposes, the entire NOL can be carried forward up to 20 years; the Company’s Italy operating entity had $87,148 net operating loss that can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income, losses arising in the first three years of activity can be offset with 100% of taxable income, after that, tax losses can only be offset with taxable income for an amount not exceeding 80% of the taxable income. As of December 31, 2023 due to uncertainties surrounding future utilization on these NOLs, the Company recorded valuation allowance of $7.03 million, respectively, against the deferred tax assets based upon management’s assessment as to their realization.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no significant uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to significant uncertain income tax positions in other expense if any; however, there were no such interest and penalties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n**NOTE 17 – THE STATUTORY RESERVES**\n\nThe Company’s ability to pay dividends primarily depends on it receiving funds from its subsidiaries. PRC laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company’s PRC subsidiaries only out of the subsidiary’s retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. The results of operations reflected in the financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of the Company’s PRC subsidiaries.\n\nIn accordance with the PRC Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment and their articles of association, a foreign-invested enterprise (“FIE”) established in the PRC is required to provide statutory reserves, which are appropriated from net profit as reported in the FIE’s PRC statutory accounts. An FIE is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit to the surplus reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its respective registered capital based on the FIE’s PRC statutory accounts. Appropriations to other funds are at the discretion of the BOD for all FIEs. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. Additionally, shareholders of an FIE are required to contribute capital to satisfy the registered capital requirement of the FIE. Until such contribution of capital is satisfied, the FIE is not allowed to repatriate profits to its shareholders, unless otherwise approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.\n\n76  \n---  \n  \nAdditionally, in accordance with the Company Laws of the PRC, a domestic enterprise is required to provide surplus reserve at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit until such reserve has reached 50% of its respective registered capital based on the enterprise’s PRC statutory accounts. A domestic enterprise is also required to have a discretionary surplus reserve, at the discretion of the BOD, from the profits determined in accordance with the enterprise’s PRC statutory accounts. Appropriation to such reserve by the Company is based on profit arrived at under PRC accounting standards for business enterprises for each year. The profit arrived at must be set off against any accumulated losses sustained by the Company in prior years, before allocation is made to the statutory reserve. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. Technology was established as domestic enterprises and therefore are subject to the above-mentioned restrictions on distributable profits.\n\nAs a result of these PRC laws and regulations that require annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax income to be set aside prior to payment of dividends as general reserve fund, the Company’s PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company as a dividend.\n\nIn addition, according to Administrative Measures for the Collection and Utilization of Enterprise Work Safety Funds issued by the PRC Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Work Safety, for the companies with dangerous goods production or storage, the company is required to make a special reserve for the use of enhancing and improving its safe production conditions. Under PRC GAAP, the reserve is recorded as selling expense; however, under US GAAP, since the expense has not been incurred and the Company will record cost of sales for safety related expenses when it is actually happened or incurred, this special reserve was recorded as an appropriation of its after-tax income. The reserve is calculated at a rate of 15% of total sales.\n\n**NOTE 18 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nOn January 3, 2024, Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.

As we grow, we expect to increase the number of employees, which would enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal control framework.\n\n_(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting_\n\nThere have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n**PART II—OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**Item 1.

If the correspondence is not addressed to the particular member, the communication will be forwarded to a Board member to bring to the attention of the Board. The Company’s Secretary will review all communications before forwarding them to the appropriate Board member.\n\n**Director Nomination Procedures and Diversity**\n\nAs outlined above, in selecting a qualified nominee, our Board of Directors considers such factors as it deems appropriate, which may include: the current composition of our Board of Directors; the range of talents of a nominee that would best complement those already represented on our Board of Directors; the extent to which a nominee would diversify our Board of Directors; a nominee’s standards of integrity, commitment and independence of thought and judgment; a nominee’s ability to represent the long-term interests of our shareholders as a whole; a nominee’s relevant expertise and experience upon which to be able to offer advice and guidance to management; a nominee who is accomplished in his or her respective field, with superior credentials and recognition; and the need for specialized expertise. While we do not have a formal diversity policy, we believe that the backgrounds and qualifications of our directors, considered as a group, should provide a significant composite mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow our Board of Directors to fulfill its responsibilities. Applying these criteria, our Board of Directors considers candidates for membership on our Board of Directors suggested by its members, as well as by our Shareholders. Members of our Board of Directors annually review our Board of Directors’ composition by evaluating whether our Board of Directors has the right mix of skills, experience and backgrounds.\n\nOur Board of Directors may also consider an assessment of its diversity, in its broadest sense, reflecting, but not limited to, age, geography, gender and ethnicity.\n\nOur Board of Directors identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of our Board of Directors willing to continue in service. Current members of our Board of Directors with skills and experience relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of our Board of Directors does not wish to continue in service or if our Board of Directors decides not to nominate a member for re-election, our Board of Directors will review the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria set forth above.\n\nOur Board of Directors also considers nominees for our Board of Directors recommended by Shareholders. Notice of proposed stockholder nominations for our Board of Directors must be delivered in accordance with the requirements set forth in our bylaws and SEC Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Nominations must include the full name of the proposed nominee, a brief description of the proposed nominee’s business experience for at least the previous five years and a representation that the nominating stockholder is a beneficial or record owner of our common stock. Any such submission must be accompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. Nominations should be delivered to: Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., Board of Directors, 2990. Redhill Ave, Costa Mesa, California 92626, Attention: Chief Executive Officer.\n\n83  \n---  \n  \nOur Board of Directors will recommend the slate of directors to be nominated for election at the annual meeting of shareholders. We have not and do not currently employ or pay a fee to any third party to identify or evaluate, or assist in identifying or evaluating, potential director nominees.\n\n**Board of Directors Role in Risk Oversight**\n\nOur Board of Directors oversees our shareholders’ interest in the long-term success of our business strategy and our overall financial strength.\n\nOur Board of Directors is actively involved in overseeing risks associated with our business strategies and decisions. It does so, in part, through its approval of all acquisitions and business-related investments and all assumptions of debt, as well as its oversight of our executive officers pursuant to annual reviews. Our Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing risks related to corporate governance and the selection of nominees to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition, the Board reviews the potential risks related to our financial reporting. The Board meets with our Chief Financial Officer and communicates with representatives of our independent registered public accounting firm on a quarterly basis to discuss and assess the risks related to our internal controls. Additionally, material violations of our Code of Ethics and related corporate policies are reported to our Board of Directors.\n\n**Code of Business Conduct and Ethics**\n\nWe have adopted our Code of Ethics, which contains general guidelines for conducting our business and is designed to help our directors, employees and independent consultants resolve ethical issues in an increasingly complex business environment. Our Code of Ethics applies to our Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and persons performing similar functions and all members of our Board of Directors. Our Code of Ethics covers topics including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest, confidentiality of information, and compliance with laws and regulations. Shareholders may request a copy of our Code of Ethics, which will be provided without charge, by writing to: Clean Energy Technologies, Inc., Board of Directors, 1340 Reynolds Avenue, Unit 120, Costa Mesa, California 92614; Attention: Chief Executive Officer.\n\n**Compensation of Directors**\n\nThe key objective of our non-employee directors’ compensation program is to attract and retain highly qualified directors with the necessary skills, experience and character to oversee our management. We currently use equity-based compensation to compensate our directors due to our restricted cash flow position; however, we may in the future provide cash compensation to our directors. The use of equity-based compensation is designed to recognize the time commitment, expertise and potential liability relating to active Board service, while aligning the interests of our Board of Directors with the long-term interests of our shareholders.\n\nIn addition to the compensation provided to our non-employee director, which is detailed below, each non-employee director is reimbursed for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending in-person meetings of the Board of Directors and Board committees, as well for any fees incurred in attending continuing education courses for directors.\n\n**Fiscal years 2022 and 2023 Annual Cash Compensation**\n\nWe currently do not provide cash compensation to our directors and as such did not provide any cash compensation during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.\n\n84  \n---  \n  \n**Fiscal years 2022 and 2023 Equity Compensation**\n\n**_Yearly Restricted Share Awards_**\n\nUnder the terms of the discretionary restricted share unit grant provisions of our 2006 Incentive Stock Plan and our 2011 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the 2006 Plan and 2011 Plan, respectively, each non-employee director is eligible to receive grants of restricted common stock share awards at the discretion of our Board of Directors.

Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

The total number of shares of capital stock which the Corporation shall have authority to issue is: 2,020,000,000. These shares shall be divided into two classes with one billion two hundred million (2,000,000,000) shares designated as common stock at $.001 par value (the “Common Stock”) and twenty million (20,000,000) shares designated as preferred stock at $.001 par value (the “Preferred Stock”).The Preferred Stock of the Corporation shall be issuable by authority of the Board of Director(s) of the Corporation in one or more classes or one or more series within any class and such classes or series shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences, limitations or restrictions as the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine, from time to time.\n\n**Common Stock**\n\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. All outstanding shares of common stock are, and the common stock to be issued will be, fully paid and non-assessable. Each share of our common stock has identical rights and privileges in every respect. The holders of our common stock are entitled to vote upon all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held. There are no cumulative voting rights.\n\nThe holders of our common stock are entitled to share equally in dividends and other distributions that our Board of Directors may declare from time to time out of funds legally available for that purpose, if any, after the satisfaction of any prior rights and preferences of any outstanding preferred stock. If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up, the holders of common stock shares will be entitled to share ratably in the distribution of all of our assets remaining available for distribution after satisfaction of all our liabilities and our obligations to holders of our outstanding preferred stock.\n\n**Preferred Stock**\n\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and fix for each series, the designation of and number of shares to be included in each such series. Our Board of Directors is also authorized to set the powers, privileges, preferences, and relative participating, optional or other rights, if any, of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each such series.\n\nUnless our Board of Directors provides otherwise, the shares of all series of preferred stock will rank on parity with respect to the payment of dividends and to the distribution of assets upon liquidation. Any issuance by us of shares of our preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of our control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock.\n\nWe previously authorized 440 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, 20,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, and 15,000 shares Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. As of August 20, 2006, all series A, B, and C preferred had been converted into common stock.\n\nEffective August 7, 2013, our Board of Directors designated a series of our preferred stock as Series D Preferred Stock, authorizing 15,000 shares. Our Series D Preferred Stock offering terms authorized us to raise up to $1,000,000 with an over-allotment of $500,000 in multiple closings over the course of six months. We received an aggregate of $750,000 in financing in subscription for Series D Preferred Stock, or 7,500 shares.\n\nThe following are primary terms of the Series D Preferred Stock. The Series D Preferred holders were initially entitled to be paid a special monthly divided at the rate of 17.5% per annum. Initially, the Series D Preferred Stock was also entitled to be paid special dividends in the event cash dividends were not paid when scheduled. If the Company does not pay the dividend within five (5) business days from the end of the calendar month for which the payment of such dividend to owed, the Company will pay the investor a special dividend of an additional 3.5%. Any unpaid or accrued special dividends will be paid upon a liquidation or redemption. For any other dividends or distributions, the Series D Preferred Stock participates with common stock on an as-converted basis. The Series D Preferred holders may elect to convert the Series D Preferred Stock, in their sole discretion, at any time after a one year (1) year holding period, by sending the Company a notice to convert. The conversion rate is equal to the greater of $0.08 or a 20% discount to the average of the three (3) lowest closing market prices of the common stock during the ten (10) trading day period prior to conversion. The Series D Preferred Stock is redeemable from funds legally available for distribution at the option of the individual holders of the Series D Preferred Stock commencing any time after the one (1) year period from the offering closing at a price equal to the initial purchase price plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, provided, that if the Company gave notice to the investors that it was not in a financial position to redeem the Series D Preferred, the Company and the Series D Preferred holders are obligated to negotiate in good faith for an extension of the redemption period. The Company timely notified the investors that it was not in a financial position to redeem the Series D Preferred and the Company and the investors have engaged in ongoing negotiations to determine an appropriate extension period. The Company may elect to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock any time at a price equal to initial purchase price plus all accrued but unpaid dividends, subject to the investors’ right to convert, by providing written notice about its intent to redeem. Each investor has the right to convert the Series D Preferred Stock at least ten (10) days prior to such redemption by the Company.\n\nIn connection with the subscriptions for the Series D Preferred, we issued series F warrants to purchase an aggregate of 375,000 shares of our common stock at $.10 per share and series G warrants to purchase an aggregate of 375,000 shares of our common stock at $.20 per share.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, a holder holding 5,000 shares of Preferred Series D Preferred agreed to lower the dividend rate to 13% on its Series D Preferred. In September 2015, all holders of Series D Preferred signed and delivered estoppel agreements, whereby the holders agreed, among other things, that the Series D Preferred was not in default and to reduce (effective as of December 31, 2015) the dividend rate on the Series D Preferred Stock to six percent per annum and to terminate the 3.5% penalty in respect of unpaid dividends accruing on or after such date.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we signed agreements to issue 4,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $.015 for a total value of $60,000 for the conversion of 800 preferred series D shares , which were subsequently issued.\n\nWe also recorded a $60,000 commitment fee in exchange for the “stand off” and estoppel agreement and discounted conversion terms to account for the difference in the fair value which we offset to retained earnings.\n\nOn February 4, 2020 we issued 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $.04 per share, in exchange for the conversion of 800 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock.\n\nOn July 23, 2020 we issued 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $.04 per share, in exchange for the conversion of 1,200 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock.\n\nOn February 5, 2021 we issued 3,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $.08 per share, in exchange for the conversion of 1,200 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock.\n\nOn February 9, 2021 we issued 2,275,662 shares of our common stock share, in exchange for the conversion of $182,052 of accrued dividend for the series D Preferred Stock.\n\nOn February 9, 2021 we issued 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $.04 per share, in exchange for the conversion of 800 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock.\n\nOn March 12, 2021 we issued 3,693,588 shares of our common stock together with accrued preferred dividend at a price of $.08 per share, in exchange for the conversion of 1300 shares of our Series D Preferred Stock and accrued preferred dividend.\n\nOn October 31, 2023, Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) filed with the Nevada Secretary of State a certificate of designation designating 3,500,000 shares of the undesignated and authorized preferred stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share, as the 15% Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series E Preferred Stock”) and setting forth the rights, preferences and limitations of such Series E Preferred Stock.\n\nThe Series E Preferred Stock has a stated value of $1.00 (the “Stated Value”) per share. Each holder of the Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to receive dividends payable on the Stated Value of the Series E Preferred Stock at a rate of 15% per annum. The Series E Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder thereof into such number of common stocks of the Company, par value $0.001 per share, as is determined by dividing the Stated Value per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon by the conversion price of $1.00, subject to a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation. Each holder of Series E Preferred Stock also enjoys certain voting rights and preferences upon liquidation.\n\n**Exhibit 10.136**\n\nAgreement Number：XGSR-21-040\n\n**Shenzhen Gas (Hong Kong) International Co., Limited**\n\n**and**\n\n**Leading Wave Limited**\n\n**Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreement**\n\n2021 August 30\n\nGuangdong·Shenzhen\n\n**Party A:** Shenzhen Gas (Hong Kong) International Co., Limited\n\nCompany Registration No.:1640848\n\nRegistered Address: Block F, 20/F, Seabright Plaza, 9-23 Shell St., North Point, Hong Kong\n\n**Party B:** Leading Wave Limited\n\nCompany Registration No.: 218629\n\nRegistered Address: Sertus Chambers, 2/F, The Quadrant, Manglier Street, Victoria, Mahe, Republic of Seychelles.\n\nAfter extensive exchanges and in-depth communication, both parties have reached an agreement on the establishment of an in-depth strategic cooperative relationship based on the principles of equality, voluntariness, mutual benefit, and long-term friendly cooperation, and signed this agreement for mutual compliance by both parties.\n\n**1.** | **Cooperation Purpose and Objectives**  \n---|---  \n  \nCreate synergistic advantages and win-win situations between both parties through close cooperation on projects, management training, and operational integration.\n\nComplete a portfolio of mergers and acquisitions with an annual net profit of CNY 300-500 million in the next five years, and reach an investment scale of CNY 3-5 billion.\n\n1/5  \n---  \n  \n**2.** | **Scope of Cooperation**  \n---|---  \n  \nFocus on the mergers and acquisitions of urban municipal natural gas companies (including but not limited to individual private company acquisitions, private packaged deal asset acquisitions, packaged acquisitions from local governments etc.) that are in the business of natural gas (NG, pipelines) trade, clean energy development and infrastructure, pipeline investment, construction and operation, regional energy supply, urban smart energy management, energy utilization consulting services, etc. The acquisitions will be centered in the Sichuan Province, but can extend to any province or city that Party B has an edge in.\n\n**3.** | **Mode of Cooperation**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe two parties will establish a joint venture company in Hong Kong to realize the cooperation objectives.
