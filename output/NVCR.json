Brown Convention Center). \n\n**About Tumor Treating Fields**\n\nTumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are electric fields that exert physical forces to kill cancer cells via a variety of mechanisms. TTFields do not significantly affect healthy cells because they have different properties (including division rate, morphology, and electrical properties) than cancer cells. These multiple, distinct mechanisms work together to target and kill cancer cells. Due to these multimechanistic actions, TTFields therapy can be added to cancer treatment modalities in approved indications and demonstrates enhanced effects across solid tumor types when used with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibition, or targeted therapies in preclinical models. TTFields therapy provides clinical versatility that has the potential to help address treatment challenges across a range of solid tumors.\n\nTo learn more about TTFields therapy and its multifaceted effect on cancer cells, visit [ **tumortreatingfields.com** ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tumortreatingfieldstherapy.com%2F&esheet=54156038&newsitemid=20241121815294&lan=en-US&anchor=tumortreatingfields.com&index=2&md5=caf202dee95db1fdac5af5d45fbf326c) **.**\n\n**About Novocure**\n\nNovocure is a global oncology company working to extend survival in some of the most aggressive forms of cancer through the development and commercialization of its innovative therapy, Tumor Treating Fields.

We do not expect this benefit to recur.\n    * Revenue in Greater China from Novocure’s partnership with Zai Lab totaled $4.6 million.\n  * Gross margin for the quarter was 77%.\n  * Research, development and clinical studies expenses for the quarter were $51.9 million, a decrease of 3% from the same period in 2023.\n  * Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were $59.8 million, an increase of 3% compared to the same period in 2023.\n  * General and administrative expenses for the quarter were $40.1 million, a decrease of 4% compared to the same period in 2023.\n  * Net loss for the quarter was $30.6 million with loss per share of $0.28.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter was $1.7 million.\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $959.9 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Operational updates for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * 1,586 prescriptions were received in the quarter, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2023.

Active patients from the U.S., Germany, France and Japan contributed 2,200; 570; 393 and 437 active patients, respectively, with the remaining 513 active patients contributed by other active markets.\n\n\n\n**Quarterly updates and achievements:**\n\n  * In October, based on the results from the Phase 3 LUNAR trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved our Premarket Approval (PMA) application for Optune Lua for concurrent use with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on or after a platinum-based regimen. Our commercial launch in the U.S. is underway with physician certification ongoing and first prescription received shortly after approval.\n  * In October, the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Device designation for the use of TTFields therapy for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer. Breakthrough Device designation gives us more frequent, faster and interactive access to the FDA review team and senior management during the review process, priority review of our marketing application upon filing, and expedited review of pre-PMA manufacturing and quality systems compliance inspections.\n  * In September, we announced the retirement of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Asaf Danziger, effective January 1, 2025.

Novocure’s commercialized products are approved in certain countries for the treatment of adult patients with glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma and pleural mesothelioma. Novocure has several additional ongoing or completed clinical trials exploring the use of Tumor Treating Fields therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.\n\nNovocure’s global headquarters is located in Root Switzerland, with U.S. headquarters located in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and research and development facilities located in Haifa, Israel. For additional information about the company, please visit Novocure.com and follow @Novocure on LinkedIn and Twitter.\n\n***Non-GAAP Financial Measurements**\n\nWe measure our performance based upon a non-U.S. GAAP measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and shared-based compensation (“Adjusted EBITDA”). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of earnings attributable to our capital structure, tax rate and material non-cash items, specifically share-based compensation.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nIn addition to historical facts or statements of current condition, this press release may contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide Novocure’s current expectations or forecasts of future events. These may include statements regarding anticipated scientific progress on its research programs, clinical trial progress, development of potential products, interpretation of clinical results, prospects for regulatory approval, manufacturing development and capabilities, market prospects for its products, coverage, collections from third-party payers and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts. You may identify some of these forward-looking statements by the use of words in the statements such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe” or other words and terms of similar meaning. Novocure’s performance and financial results could differ materially from those reflected in these forward-looking statements due to general financial, economic, environmental, regulatory and political conditions and other more specific risks and uncertainties facing Novocure such as those set forth in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2024, and subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Given these risks and uncertainties, any or all of these forward-looking statements may prove to be incorrect. Therefore, you should not rely on any such factors or forward-looking statements. Furthermore, Novocure does not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statement, except as required by law. Any forward-looking statements herein speak only as of the date hereof.

The foregoing will not apply to information that (i) was known to the public prior to its disclosure to\nyou; (ii) becomes generally known to the public or in the industry subsequent to disclosure to you through no\nwrongful act by you or any of your representatives; or (iii) you are required to disclose by applicable law, regulation\nor legal process (provided that you provide the Company with prior notice of the contemplated disclosure and\ncooperate with the Company in seeking a protective order or other appropriate protection of such information).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement or otherwise, nothing herein shall prohibit\nyou from reporting possible violations of federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity or\nself-regulatory organization including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, Congress, and any agency Inspector General, or making other disclosures that are\nExhibit 10.1\nprotected under the whistleblower provisions of federal or state law or regulation (it being understood that you do not\nneed the Company’s prior authorization to make any such reports or disclosures and you are not required to notify the\nCompany that you have made such reports or disclosures).\n(c) Non-Solicitation of Customers.

You agree that, during the Restricted Period, you will not (x)\ndirectly or indirectly, individually or on behalf of any other person or entity solicit or recruit any employee of the\nNovocure Group to leave such employment for the purpose of being employed by, or rendering services to, you or\nany person or entity unaffiliated with the Novocure Group, or (y) convey any such confidential information or trade\nsecrets about other employees of the Novocure Group to any person or entity other than in the course of your\nassigned duties hereunder and for the benefit of the Novocure Group or as otherwise required by law or judicial or\nadministrative process.\n(f) Non-Disparagement.

We do not expect this benefit to recur.\n◦ Revenue in Greater China from Novocure’s partnership with Zai Lab totaled $4.6 million.\n• Gross margin for the quarter was 77%.\n• Research, development and clinical studies expenses for the quarter were $51.9 million, a decrease of 3% from\nthe same period in 2023.\n• Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were $59.8 million, an increase of 3% compared to the same\nperiod in 2023.\n• General and administrative expenses for the quarter were $40.1 million, a decrease of 4% compared to the same\nperiod in 2023.\n• Net loss for the quarter was $30.6 million with loss per share of $0.28.\n• Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter was $1.7 million.\nExhibit 99.1\n• Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $959.9 million as of September 30, 2024.\nOperational updates for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024:\n• 1,586 prescriptions were received in the quarter, an increase of 8% compared to the same period in 2023.\nPrescriptions from the U.S., Germany, France and Japan contributed 934; 217; 171 and 99 prescriptions,\nrespectively, with the remaining 165 prescriptions received in other active markets.\n• As of September 30, 2024, there were 4,113 active patients on therapy. Active patients from the U.S., Germany,\nFrance and Japan contributed 2,200; 570; 393 and 437 active patients, respectively, with the remaining 513\nactive patients contributed by other active markets.\nQuarterly updates and achievements:\n• In October, based on the results from the Phase 3 LUNAR trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\napproved our Premarket Approval (PMA) application for Optune Lua for concurrent use with PD-1/PD-L1\ninhibitors or docetaxel for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on or after\na platinum-based regimen. Our commercial launch in the U.S. is underway with physician certification ongoing\nand first prescription received shortly after approval.\n• In October, the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Device designation for the use of TTFields therapy for brain\nmetastases from non-small cell lung cancer.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.S. dollars in thousands (except share data)\nNOTE 1: ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization. NovoCure Limited (including its consolidated subsidiaries, the \"Company\") was incorporated in the Bailiwick of Jersey and is principally\nengaged in the development, manufacture and commercialization of Tumor Treating Fields (\"TTFields\") devices, including Optune Gio and Optune Lua\n(collectively, our \"Products\"), for the treatment of solid tumor cancers. The Company markets Optune Gio and Optune Lua in multiple countries around\nthe globe with the majority of revenues coming from the use of Optune Gio in the U.S., Germany, France and Japan. The Company also has a License\nand Collaboration Agreement (the \"Zai Agreement\") with Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (\"Zai\") to market Optune in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan\n(\"Greater China\").\nFinancial statement preparation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the unaudited consolidated financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation for the periods\npresented. The preparation of these unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these unaudited consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"2023 10-K\") filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission on February 22, 2024.\nThe significant accounting policies applied in the audited annual consolidated financial statements of the Company as disclosed in the 2023 10-K are\napplied consistently in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements.\nConcentration Risks. The Company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and trade receivables are potentially subject to a concentration of\nrisk. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are invested at top tier financial institutions globally and the total value invested at any one\ninstitution is limited pursuant to the Company's investment policy. These investments may be in excess of insured limitations or not insured in certain\njurisdictions. Generally, these investments may be redeemed upon demand according to the terms of the securities.\nThe Company's trade receivables are due from numerous governments and federal and state agencies that are paid from their respective budgets, and\nfrom hundreds of health insurance companies. The Company does not believe that there are significant default risks associated with these governments,\nagencies and health insurance companies based upon the Company's historical experience.\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet concentrations of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other foreign hedging\narrangements.\nRecently announced accounting pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’\nsignificant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the\ndisclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and\nannual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities,\non an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by\njurisdiction.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to provide information to assist you in\nbetter understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. We encourage you to read this MD&A in conjunction with our\nunaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the period ended September 30, 2024 included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the information under the\nheading “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this report. References to the words “we,” “our,” “us,” and the\n“Company” in this report refer to NovoCure Limited, including its consolidated subsidiaries.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), in preparing our financial statements, we must make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We develop and periodically change these estimates\nand assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"2023 10-K\"). For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. There were no other material\nchanges to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global oncology company with a proprietary platform technology called Tumor Treating Fields (\"TTFields\"), which are electric fields that exert\nphysical forces to kill cancer cells via a variety of mechanisms. Our key priorities are to drive commercial adoption of Optune Gio® and Optune Lua®, our\ncommercial TTFields therapy devices, and to advance clinical and product development programs intended to extend overall survival in some of the\nmost aggressive forms of cancer.\nOptune Gio is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") under the Premarket Approval (\"PMA\") pathway for the treatment of adult\npatients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (\"GBM\") together with temozolomide, a chemotherapy drug, and for adult patients with GBM following\nconfirmed recurrence after chemotherapy as monotherapy treatment. We also have a CE certificate to market Optune Gio for the treatment of GBM in\nthe European Union (\"EU\"), as well as approval or local registration in the United Kingdom (\"UK\"), Japan, Canada and certain other countries. Optune\nLua is approved by the FDA under the PMA pathway for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (\"NSCLC\") concurrent\nwith PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or docetaxel following progression on or after a platinum-based regimen and under the Humanitarian Device Exemption\n(\"HDE\") pathway to treat malignant pleural mesothelioma and pleural mesothelioma (together, \"MPM\") together with standard chemotherapies. We have\nalso received CE certification in the EU and approval or local registration to market Optune Lua in certain other countries for the treatment of MPM. We\nmarket Optune Gio and Optune Lua in multiple countries around the globe with the majority of our revenues coming from the use of Optune Gio in the\nU.S., Germany, France and Japan. We are actively evaluating opportunities to expand our international footprint.\nWe believe the physical mechanisms of action behind TTFields therapy may be broadly applicable to solid tumor cancers. We are focusing our research\nand development activities in areas of greatest anticipated value creation. This includes NSCLC, brain cancers, and pancreatic cancer.\nIn October 2024, the U.S. FDA approved our PMA application for Optune Lua use concurrent use with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or docetaxel for the\ntreatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed on or after a platinum-based regimen. This application was based on the\nresults from the phase 3 LUNAR trial, which showed patients treated with TTFields therapy concomitant with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or docetaxel\nexhibited a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in median overall survival (OS) compared to patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1\ninhibitors or docetaxel alone. The LUNAR trial included two pre-specified powered secondary endpoints. The first secondary endpoint, which met\nstatistical significance, assessed median OS in patients treated with Optune Lua concurrently with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor versus a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor\nalone. The second secondary endpoint, which showed a positive trend but did not meet statistical significance, assessed Optune Lua\n20\nTable of Contents\nconcurrently with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone. We have also filed applications for use to the necessary regulatory bodies in Europe and Japan.\nIn June 2024, we presented positive results from the phase 3 METIS trial, evaluating the use of TTFields therapy and supportive care for the treatment\nof patients with 1-10 brain metastases from NSCLC following stereotactic radiosurgery (“METIS”) at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology\n(ASCO) annual meeting. The METIS trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in time to intracranial\nprogression for adult patients treated with TTFields therapy and supportive care compared to patients treated with supportive care alone. Patients\ntreated with TTFields therapy and supportive care exhibited a median time to intracranial progression of 21.9 months compared to 11.3 months in\npatients treated with supportive care alone for brain metastasis (n=298; hazard ratio=0.67; P=0.016). These data are expected to serve as the basis for\nregulatory submissions. In October 2024, the FDA granted Breakthrough Device designation for the use of our NovoTTF-200M device and supportive\ncare for the treatment brain metastases from NSCLC as used in the METIS protocol. The designation offers us an opportunity to interact with FDA\nexperts throughout the premarket review phase and allows for prioritized review of regulatory submissions.\nIn June 2024, we presented top-line results from the prospective, non-interventional TIGER study at the 2024 ASCO annual meeting. The TIGER study\ninvestigated the use of TTFields therapy in routine clinical use in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM in Germany. Of the 710 patients enrolled in the\nstudy between August 2017 to November 2019, 429 patients received TTFields therapy, across 81 participating centers. Median overall survival for\npatients treated with TTFields therapy was 19.6 months (95% CI, 17.9-22.4) and median progression-free survival was 10.2 months (95% CI, 9.4-11.4).\nTTFields therapy use was not associated with an increase in systemic toxicity and was well tolerated. The outcomes observed in the TIGER study are\nconsistent with the survival and safety results from our phase 3 EF-14 clinical trial.\nIn March 2024, an exploratory subgroup analysis of the phase 3 INNOVATE-3 clinical trial was presented at the European Society of Gynaecological\nOncology 2024 Congress. The randomized, phase 3 INNOVATE-3 trial evaluated the use of TTFields therapy together with paclitaxel in platinum-\nresistant ovarian cancer in patients with a maximum of five total prior lines of systemic therapy. While the INNOVATE-3 trial did not meet its primary\noverall survival endpoint in the intent-to-treat population, the exploratory subgroup analysis found that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) -naïve\npatients randomized to receive TTFields therapy and paclitaxel demonstrated significant improvement in median overall survival compared to PLD-naïve\npatients treated with paclitaxel alone. These data provide valuable insights into the use of TTFields therapy in the treatment of solid tumors and will be\ninformative in the design of future clinical trials. Novocure and investigators will continue to analyze the data from the INNOVATE-3 trial.\nWe have several ongoing or planned trials which will further explore the use of TTFields therapy in the treatment of NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, and\nprimary brain cancer.\nAlongside the LUNAR and METIS phase 3 trials, our NSCLC program includes the phase 3 LUNAR-2 trial, which explores the use of TTFields therapy\ntogether with pembrolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC and the phase 2 LUNAR-4 trial, which\nevaluates the use of TTFields therapy together with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) following prior ICI treatment as a second-line treatment for\nmetastatic NSCLC. LUNAR-2 and LUNAR-4 are currently open and enrolling. Finally, our phase 2 KEYNOTE B36 trial is exploring the use of TTFields\ntherapy together with pembrolizumab for front-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. We are evaluating appropriate next steps for this\ntrial given its pace of enrollment and our focus on LUNAR-2.\nOur pancreatic cancer program is comprised of the phase 3 PANOVA-3 trial and the phase 2 PANOVA-4 trial. The PANOVA-3 trial is exploring the use of\nTTFields therapy together with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine as front-line treatment for unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer and is fully\nenrolled with top-line data anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2024. The PANOVA-4 trial is exploring the use of TTFields therapy together with\natezolizumab, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer and has completed enrollment with data anticipated in\n2026.\nOur primary brain cancer clinical trial program includes the fully enrolled phase 3 TRIDENT trial and the phase 3 KEYNOTE D58 trial. The TRIDENT trial\nis exploring the use of TTFields therapy concomitant with radiation and chemotherapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM and data is anticipated\nin 2026. The KEYNOTE D58 trial is evaluating the use of TTFields therapy together with temozolomide and pembrolizumab for the treatment of newly\ndiagnosed GBM and we are initiating clinical sites.\n21\nTable of Contents\nWe anticipate expanding our clinical pipeline over time to study the safety and efficacy of TTFields therapy for additional solid tumor indications and\ncombinations with other cancer treatment modalities.The table below presents the current status of the ongoing clinical trials in our pipeline and\nanticipated timing of data.\nOur therapy is delivered through a medical device and we continue to advance our Products with the intention to extend survival and maintain quality of\nlife for patients. We have several product development programs underway that are designed to optimize TTFields delivery to the target tumor and\nenhance patient ease of use. One of these initiatives is the launch of new arrays, which are thinner, lighter and more flexible. We have obtained a CE\nMark and rolled out our new arrays in multiple European countries. We submitted the new arrays for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Japan and are\nawaiting regulatory decisions.\nIn 2018, we granted Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (\"Zai\") a license to commercialize our Products in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (\"Greater\nChina\") under a License and Collaboration Agreement (the \"Zai Agreement\"). The Zai Agreement also establishes a development partnership intended\nto accelerate the development of TTFields therapy in multiple solid tumor cancer indications. For additional information, see Note 13 to the 2023 10-K.\nIn September 2024, we announced that our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Asaf Danziger, will retire at year-end 2024 and Novocure’s Chief Financial\nOfficer (CFO), Ashley Cordova, will succeed him as the company’s next CEO. Mr. Danziger, who has served as CEO since 2002, will serve as Senior\nAdvisor through 2026, and will continue to serve on Novocure’s Board of Directors. These changes will become effective on January 1, 2025. In addition,\nMukund Paravasthu transitioned into the role of Chief Operating Officer, effective October 1, 2024.\nIn October 2024, we announced the appointment of Christoph Brackmann as our CFO, effective January 1, 2025. Mr. Brackmann joined in October\n2024 as a Senior Finance Advisor and will continue in that role until his appointment as CFO takes effect. Prior to joining Novocure, Mr. Brackmann\nserved as Senior Vice President, Finance at Moderna Inc. from October 2019 to June 2024. During that time Mr. Brackmann built out the finance team\nacross FP&A, accounting, tax, treasury, procurement and business service centers to support Moderna’s scale-up. Mr. Brackmann earned his Master of\nBusiness Administration from the SDA Bocconi School of Management in 2003 and holds a degree in Business and Economics from the University of\nManheim.\nWe view our operations and manage our business in one operating segment. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net\nrevenues were $155.1 million and $444.0 million, respectively. Our net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $30.6 million\nand $102.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1,088.2 million.\nImpact of Current Events\nOn October 7, 2023, the State of Israel was attacked and is in a state of war. As of the date of this filing, we believe that there is no immediate risk to our\nbusiness facilities or operations. Our supply chain teams have increased stock levels to mitigate distribution and service risks from our suppliers in\nIsrael.\n22\nTable of Contents\nCommentary on Results of Operations\nNet revenues. Our revenues are primarily derived from patients using our Products in our active markets. We charge for treatment with our Products on\na monthly basis. Our potential net revenues per patient are determined by our ability to secure payment, the monthly fee we collect and the number of\nmonths that the patient remains on therapy.\nWe also receive revenues pursuant to the Zai Agreement. For additional information regarding the Zai Agreement, see Note 13 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in our 2023 10-K.\nCost of revenues. We contract with third parties to manufacture our Products. Our cost of revenues is primarily comprised of the following:\n• disposable arrays;\n• depreciation expense for the field equipment, including the electric field generator used by patients;\n• patient support and other personnel costs; and\n• overhead costs, such as facilities, freight and depreciation of property, plant and equipment associated with managing our inventory,\nwarehousing and order fulfillment functions.\nOperating expenses. Our operating expenses consist of research, development and clinical studies, sales and marketing and general and\nadministrative expenses. Personnel costs are a significant component for each category of operating expenses and consist of wages, benefits and\nbonuses. Personnel costs also include share-based compensation.\nFinancial income (expenses), net. Financial income (expenses), net primarily consists of interest income from cash balances and short-term\ninvestments, credit facility interest expense and related debt issuance costs, and gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions. Our reporting\ncurrency is the U.S. dollar. We have historically held substantially all of our cash balances in U.S. dollar denominated accounts to minimize the risk of\ntranslational currency exposure.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and reasons for material changes therein for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tables contained in this section report U.S. dollars in\nthousands (except share, patient, and prescription data).

The number of active patients on therapy is our principal revenue\ndriver. An \"active patient\" is a patient who is receiving treatment under a commercial prescription order as of the measurement date, including patients\nwho may be on a temporary break from treatment and who plan to resume treatment in less than 60 days. Prescriptions are a leading indicator of\ndemand. A \"prescription received\" is a commercial order for Optune Gio or Optune Lua that is received from a physician certified to treat patients with\nour Products for a patient not previously on Optune Gio or Optune Lua. Orders to renew or extend treatment are not included in this total.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following table includes certain commercial operating statistics for and as of the end of the periods presented.\nSeptember 30,\nOperating statistics 2024 2023\nActive patients at period end\nUnited States 2,200 2,179\nInternational markets:\nGermany 570 492\nFrance 393 165\nJapan 437 353\nOther international 513 450\nInternational markets - Total 1,913 1,460\nTotal 4,113 3,639\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPrescriptions received in period\nUnited States 934 920 2,881 2,952\nInternational markets:\nGermany 217 163 629 575\nFrance 171 150 533 302\nJapan 99 85 298 249\nOther international 165 149 522 441\nInternational markets - Total 652 547 1,982 1,567\nTotal 1,586 1,467 4,863 4,519\nThree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nNet revenues $ 155,095 $ 127,321 22 % $ 443,954 $ 375,554 18 %\nNet revenues. Net revenues increased 22% to $155.1 million for the three months ending September 30, 2024 from $127.3 million for the same period\nin 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase primarily resulted from $11.1 million and $35.8 million of net revenues\nfrom the successful launch in France and $12.1 million and $26.2 million of net revenues in the U.S. due to improved approval rates. The improved\napproval rates in the U.S. resulted in $4.7 million and $14.0 million of increased net revenue from prior period claims during the three- and nine- month\nperiods, primarily from 2023.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nCost of revenues $ 35,372 $ 32,092 10 % $ 103,715 $ 95,724 8 %\nCost of revenues. Our cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $35.4 million, an increase of 10% from $32.1 million for\nthe same period in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to 13% growth\nin active patients, partially offset by lower equipment sales to Zai in the amount of $1.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\nExcluding sales to Zai, cost of revenues per active patient per month was $2,713 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4%\nfrom $2,599 for the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in\n25\nTable of Contents\ncosts related to the rollout of our new arrays. Cost of revenues per active patient is calculated by dividing the cost of revenues for the quarter less\nequipment sales to Zai for the quarter by the average of the active patients at the end of the prior quarter and the ending active patients in the current\nquarter. This quarterly figure is then divided by three to estimate the monthly cost of revenues per active patient. Sales to Zai are deducted because they\nare sold at cost and in anticipation of future royalties from Zai, and Zai patient counts are not included in our active patient population. Product sales to\nZai totaled $2.5 million and $8.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $4.0 million and $10.3 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nGross margin was 77% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 75% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\nimprovement in gross margin is due to the increase in net revenue per patient primarily attributed to our improved approval rates in the US and\nsuccessful launch in France. We expect that our gross margins will be impacted by current and future product enhancements, such as the launch of our\nnew arrays in the U.S. and our launch in NSCLC. We continue to focus on opportunities to increase efficiencies and scale within our supply chain. This\nincludes evaluating new materials, manufacturers, and processes that could lead to lower costs.\nOperating Expenses.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nResearch, development and clinical studies $ 51,882 $ 53,623 (3)% $ 158,435 $ 168,754 (6)%\nSales and marketing 59,830 57,964 3 % 171,652 167,621 2 %\nGeneral and administrative 40,103 41,887 (4)% 117,344 124,609 (6)%\nTotal operating expenses $ 151,815 $ 153,474 (1)% $ 447,431 $ 460,984 (3)%\nResearch, development and clinical study expenses. Research, development and clinical study expenses decreased 3% to $51.9 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 from $53.6 million for the same period in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nchange was primarily due to a decrease in personnel expenses. Total research and development expenses can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter dependent\nupon the amount of clinical research organization services delivered, clinical materials procured and the number of trials actively underway within a\ngiven quarter.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 3% to $59.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from\n$58.0 million for the same period in 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the change was primarily driven by an $7.8 million increase\nin costs related to a sales force expansion in anticipation of a potential launch in NSCLC, partially offset by a $6.2 million reduction in marketing spend.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the increase was primarily driven by a $10.8 million increase related to the sales force expansion for\nNSCLC, partially offset by a $6.7 million reduction in marketing spend.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 4% to $40.1 million for the three-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $41.9 million for the same period in 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, these changes were\nprimarily due to lower personnel and professional service expenses.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nFinancial income (expenses), net $ 10,507 $ 10,023 5 % $ 31,236 $ 27,948 12 %\nFinancial income (expenses), net. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, financial income increased $0.5 million or 5% to $10.5 million\nfrom $10.0 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to $0.8 million higher interest income and $3.5 million in favorable foreign exchange\nadjustments, offset by $3.0 million in interest expenses related to the senior secured credit facility (see \"Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility\"\nbelow). Financial income increased $3.3 million or 12%, to $31.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\n26\nTable of Contents\nfrom $27.9 million in income for the same period in 2023, primarily due to $5.0 million in higher interest income, $2.3 million in favorable foreign\nexchange impact and $1.1 million in gain from redemption of the Notes, offset by $4.9 million in interest expenses related to the senior secured credit\nfacility.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nIncome taxes $ 8,985 $ 1,263 611 % $ 26,749 $ 6,758 296 %\nIncome taxes. Income taxes increased 611% to $9.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.3 million for the same period in\n2023 primarily due to $5.6 million resulting from the utilization of tax credits in 2023 related to prior years and a change in the mix of applicable statutory\ntax rates. Income taxes increased 296% to $26.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $6.8 million for the same period in 2023\nprimarily due to a $7.3 million decrease in tax benefits from share-based compensation, $5.2 million resulting from the utilization of tax credits in 2023\nrelated to prior years and a change in the mix of applicable statutory tax rates.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nWe also measure our performance using a non-GAAP measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and shared-based\ncompensation (“Adjusted EBITDA”). We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it helps\ninvestors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of earnings attributable to our capital\nstructure, tax rate and material non-cash items, specifically share-based compensation.\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as operating income before financial expenses and income taxes, net of depreciation, amortization and share-based\ncompensation. The following table reconciles net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure, to\nAdjusted EBITDA.\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 % Change 2024 2023 % Change\nNet income (loss) $ (30,570) $ (49,485) (38)% $ (102,705) $ (159,964) (36)%\nAdd: Income tax 8,985 1,263 611 % 26,749 6,758 296 %\nAdd: Financial expenses (income), net (10,507) (10,023) 5 % (31,236) (27,948) 12 %\nAdd: Depreciation and amortization 2,458 2,803 (12)% 8,131 8,246 (1)%\nEBITDA $ (29,634) $ (55,442) (47)% $ (99,061) $ (172,908) (43)%\nAdd: Share-based compensation 31,364 26,346 19 % 97,278 98,170 (1)%\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 1,730 $ (29,096) (106)% $ (1,783) $ (74,738) (98)%\nAdjusted EBITDA increased by $30.8 million to $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $(29.1) million for the same period in\n2023. This increase was primarily driven by revenue growth from improved approval rates in the U.S. and a successful launch in France. The revenue\nincrease drove a $24.5 million increase in gross profit. Actions taken during the November 2023 restructuring and a heightened focus on operational\nefficiencies reduced total operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation, by $6.3 million year-over-year. We intend to take actions that\nprioritize growth and maintain financial health and flexibility as we position our company for future profitability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred significant losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our founding in 2000. As of September 30, 2024, we had\nan accumulated deficit of $1,088.2 million. To date, we have primarily financed our operations through the issuance and sale of equity and the proceeds\nfrom long-term loans.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $959.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, an increase of $49.3 million compared to $910.6\nmillion at December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the $100 million draw down of the first tranche of our senior secured credit facility in May 2024 (see\n\"Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility\" below), offset by net cash used in operations and used in investing activities. We believe our cash, cash\nequivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 are sufficient for our operations for at least the next 12\n27\nTable of Contents\nmonths based on our existing business plan and our ability to control the timing of significant expense commitments. We expect that our operating\nexpenses will continue to increase over the next several years and may outpace our gross profit as we prepare to expand into additional indications\nbeyond GBM. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\nThe following summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are\nincluded elsewhere in this Quarterly Report:\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change % Change\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (22,918) $ (58,778) $ 35,860 (61)%\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (118,031) 85,648 (203,679) (238)%\nNet cash provided by financing activities 87,630 13,877 73,753 531 %\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (46) (69) 23 (33)%\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (53,365) $ 40,678 $ (94,043) (231)%\nOperating activities. Net cash used in or provided by operating activities represents our net income (loss) for the periods presented, share-based\ncompensation and depreciation and amortization. Operating cash flows are also impacted by changes in working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased by $35.9 million from $58.8 million net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 to $22.9 million net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was a result of a $57.3\nmillion reduction in net loss, offset by a $22.9 million increase in working capital primarily driven by a $33.1 million increase in accounts receivable and a\n$7.4 million decrease of inventories, a decrease of $6.0 million in cash to non-cash based expenses primarily consisting of shared-based compensation,\nand a decrease of $4.4 million in other long term assets and an increase of $2.8 million in other long-term liabilities.\nInvesting activities. Our investing activities consist primarily of investments in and redemptions of our short-term investments as well as investments in\nproperty and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $118.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $85.6 million provided by investing\nactivities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The $118.0 million net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to $84.1 million of the net purchase of short term investments and the purchase of $33.9 million of\nproperty and equipment. The $85.6 million net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily\nattributable to $105.9 million of net proceeds from maturity of short term investments and by the purchase of $20.3 million of property and equipment.\nFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $87.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $13.9\nmillion provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to $96.9 million of net proceeds from the\nfirst tranche of our senior secured credit facility offset by $12.9 million used to partially repay Notes, In addition, the net cash provided by financing\nactivities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included proceeds from the exercise of options under the Company's\nshare option plan.\nConvertible Notes\nOn November 5, 2020, we issued $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations. The Notes do not\nbear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes will not accrete. The Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 5.9439 ordinary\nshares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $168.24 per ordinary share. The\nNotes are convertible at the option of the holders upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions and during certain periods, and if the Company\nexercises its right to redeem the Notes as permitted or required by the indenture. On or after August 1, 2025 until the close of the business on the\nbusiness day immediately preceding the\n28\nTable of Contents\nmaturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at the conversion rate at any time irrespective of the foregoing conditions.\nIn January 2021, we irrevocably elected to settle all conversions of Notes by a combination of cash and our ordinary shares and that the cash portion\nper $1,000 principal amount of Notes for all conversion settlements shall be $1,000. Accordingly, from and after the date of the election, upon conversion\nof any Notes, holders of Notes will receive, with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of Notes converted, cash in an amount up to $1,000 and the\nbalance of the conversion value, if any, in our ordinary shares.\nFor more information, see Note 10a. to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 10-K.\nSenior Secured Term Loan Credit Facility\nOn May 1, 2024 Novocure Luxembourg S.a.r.l. (\"Borrower\"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into a new five-year senior secured credit facility of up\nto $400.0 million (the \"Facility\") with BPCR Limited Partnership and BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP (collectively, the \"Lenders\"),\nBioPharma Credit PLC, as collateral agent for the Lenders, and the guarantors party to such agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\"). The Facility may be\ndrawn in up to four drawings. The Loan Agreement provides for an initial term loan in the principal amount of $100.0 million (the \"Tranche A Loan\"),\nwhich was funded to the Borrower on May 1, 2024 (the \"Tranche A Funding Date\"). Under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower is required to draw\n$100.0 million on the Facility on or before June 30, 2025 (the \"Tranche B Loan\"), subject to customary conditions precedent as set forth in the Loan\nAgreement. Not later than December 31, 2025, the Borrower has the option to draw an additional $100.0 million of the Facility (the \"Tranche C Loan\") if\n(i) (A) we have received positive results from our PANOVA-3 phase 3 clinical trial or (B) our trailing net revenues for the most recently completed four\nquarters as reported in our financial statements filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Trailing Four Quarters of Net Revenue\") are\ngreater than $575.0 million and (ii) the Notes are extinguished in full and are no longer outstanding. Not later than March 31, 2026, the Borrower has the\noption to draw an additional $100.0 million of the Facility (the \"Tranche D Loan\") if (i) we receive an approval or clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration for our Tumor Treating Fields device for a pancreatic cancer indication or (ii) Trailing Four Quarters of Net Revenue is greater than\n$625.0 million. The obligations under the Loan Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by a first lien on the Borrower's and\ncertain of our other subsidiaries’ assets. Outstanding term loans under the Loan Agreement will bear interest at an annual rate equal to 6.25% plus the\nthree-month SOFR (subject to a 3.25% floor), payable quarterly in arrears and calculated on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 360-day year. The\nBorrower must pay 2.5% of additional consideration on each principal draw, with payment for the Tranche A Loan and the Tranche B Loan paid on the\nTranche A Funding Date, and payments for the Tranche C Loan and the Tranche D Loan on their respective funding dates. Principal under the Facility\nwill be repaid in eight equal quarterly repayments commencing with the third quarter of 2027 and continuing each quarter thereafter, with the final\npayment of outstanding principal due on the fifth anniversary of the Tranche A Funding Date. Voluntary prepayment of all, but not less than all, of the\nterm loans outstanding is permitted at any time, subject to make-whole and prepayment premiums as set forth in the Loan Agreement. Prepayment of all\nterm loans outstanding, subject to make-whole and prepayment premiums, is due and payable upon a change-in-control as defined in the Loan\nAgreement. Make-whole and prepayment premiums are due and payable for the Tranche B Loans for any voluntary prepayment of the term loans\noutstanding, upon a change-in-control (as defined in the Loan Agreement), and upon any acceleration of the maturity date, in each case regardless of\nwhether the Tranche B Loan is drawn. The Loan Agreement contains a financial covenant only if the Tranche C Loan and/or Tranche D Loan are funded,\nin which case we are required to maintain at least Trailing Four Quarters of Net Revenue of at least $500.0 million, calculated on a trailing twelve-month\nbasis as of the end of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the first quarter of 2027 based on year-end 2026 audited financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThere have been no material changes from the information disclosed in our 2023 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”) rules.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes from the information disclosed in our 2023 10-K.\n29\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), our management, under the supervision\nand with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of September 30, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange\nAct, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s\nrules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to\nbe disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of\nachieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and\nprocedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance\nlevel.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n30\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nIn June 2023, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, its Executive Chairman and its Chief Executive Officer. The complaint, later\namended to add our Chief Financial Officer as a defendant, which purports to be brought on behalf of a class of persons and/or entities who purchased\nor otherwise acquired ordinary shares of the Company from January 5, 2023 through June 5, 2023, alleges material misstatements and/or omissions in\nthe Company’s public statements with respect to the results from its phase 3 LUNAR clinical trial. The Company believes that the action is without merit\nand plans to defend the lawsuit vigorously.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings, claims, investigations and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of our\nbusiness. Litigation is inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these matters. After considering a number of\nfactors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience,\nmanagement believes that the ultimate disposition of these legal actions will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of\noperations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to our risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in the 2023 10-K.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nSecurities Trading Plans of Executive Officers and Directors\nRule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables prearranged transactions in securities in a manner that avoids\nconcerns about initiating transactions at a future date while possibly in possession of material nonpublic information. Our Insider Trading Policy permits\nour executive officers and directors to enter into trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1.\nDuring the three-month period ending September 30, 2024 neither we nor any of our executive officers or directors adopted or terminated any contract,\ninstruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c)\npromulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or adopted or terminated a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in\nItem 408(c) of Regulation S-K).\n31\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.

The approval\nof Optune Lua brings a new and urgently needed option for people with metastatic NSCLC who have progressed while\non or after platinum-based chemotherapy,” said Asaf Danziger, CEO, Novocure. “We are grateful to the patients,\ncaregivers, investigators and healthcare providers who supported the clinical trials that led to this approval.”\nOptune Lua is a portable device that produces alternating electric fields known as tumor treating fields (TTFields), which\nare delivered through non-invasive, wearable arrays. TTFields exert physical forces on the electrically charged\ncomponents of dividing cancer cells, resulting in cell death.\n“There have been a number of important advances in first-line treatment for NSCLC, but this is an aggressive disease,\nand most patients will develop progression, with limited effective treatment options in second line and beyond,” said\nTiciana Leal, MD, Associate Professor and Director of the Thoracic Oncology Program at the Winship Cancer Institute of\nEmory University School of Medicine and primary investigator of the LUNAR study. “The overall survival results we\nobserved with Optune Lua in the LUNAR study mark the first substantial improvement in more than 8 years in this\npatient population which, when combined with Optune Lua’s lack of systemic toxicity, make this a compelling\ndevelopment for many patients and their physicians who need better treatment options for this advanced disease.”\n\"We are excited patients with metastatic NSCLC have more options, which they urgently need,” said GO2 for Lung\nCancer Chief Patient Officer Danielle Hicks. “The fight against lung cancer is always evolving, and the number of people\naffected by this disease is underappreciated. That is why Novocure’s commitment to advancing treatment is exciting for\nthe whole lung cancer community.”\nExhibit 99.1\nData Supporting the Optune Lua Approval\nThe Phase 3 LUNAR study was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study that compared the use of\nOptune Lua concurrent with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or docetaxel (experimental arm) to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or\ndocetaxel alone (control arm) for patients with metastatic NSCLC who progressed during or after platinum-based\ntherapy.\nThe primary endpoint of the study was achieved demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful 3.3-\nmonth (P=0.04) extension in median overall survival (OS) for patients treated with Optune Lua concurrently with a PD-\n1/PD-L1 inhibitor or docetaxel (n=145). The group treated with Optune Lua concurrently with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor or\ndocetaxel had a median OS of 13.2 months (95% CI, 10.3 to 15.5 months) compared to a median OS of 9.9 months\n(95% CI, 8.2 to 12.2 months) in the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor or docetaxel treated group (n=146).\nThe LUNAR study included two pre-specified powered secondary endpoints. The first secondary endpoint, which met\nstatistical significance, assessed median OS in patients treated with Optune Lua concurrently with a PD-1/PD-L1\ninhibitor versus a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor alone. The second secondary endpoint, which showed a positive trend but did\nnot meet statistical significance, assessed Optune Lua concurrently with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone.\nPatients randomized to Optune Lua and a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor (n=70) demonstrated a median OS of 19.0 months (95%\nCI, 10.6 to 28.2 months) compared to a median OS of 10.8 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 17.6 months) in patients treated a\nwith PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor alone (n=71), which was a statistically significant extension in median OS of more than 8.0\nmonths (P=0.02).\nPatients randomized to receive Optune Lua and docetaxel (n=75) had a median OS of 11.1 months (95% CI, 8.2 to 13.9\nmonths) compared to a median OS of 8.9 months (95% CI, 6.5 to 11.3 months) in patients treated with docetaxel alone\n(n=75). This 2.2 month extension in median OS did not provide a statistically significant demonstrated benefit, but did\nshow a positive trend.\nDevice-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 63.1% of patients (n=89), these were skin-related disorders under the\ntransducer arrays. The majority of these events were low grade (Grade 1 - 2), with only 4% (n=6) experiencing Grade 3\nskin toxicity that required a break from treatment. There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 toxicities related to Optune Lua,\nand no device-related AEs that caused death.\nBaseline patient characteristics were well balanced between cohorts: median age was 65 years (range, 22-86); 66%\nmale, 34% female; 96% of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1. PD-L1 expression data were collected\nfrom 83% of patients (69 of 83 patients) enrolled at U.S. sites and were well balanced across the four cohorts.\nExhibit 99.1\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)\nLung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide[1], and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\naccounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancers. It is estimated that approximately 193,000 patients are diagnosed\nwith NSCLC each year in the U.S.\nPhysicians use different combinations of surgery, radiation and pharmacological therapies to treat NSCLC, depending\non the stage of the disease. Surgery, which may be curative in a subset of patients, is usually used in early stages of the\ndisease. Since 1991, radiation with a combination of platinum-based chemotherapy drugs has been the first-line\nstandard of care for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Certain immune checkpoint inhibitors, including both PD-1\nand PD-L1 inhibitors. have been approved for the first-line treatment of NSCLC and the standard of care in this setting\ncontinues to evolve rapidly.\nIt is estimated that approximately 30,000 patients actively seek treatment for stage 4 NSCLC after progressing during or\nafter platinum-based therapy each year in the U.S. The standard of care for second-line treatment is also evolving and\nmay include platinum-based chemotherapy for patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors as their first-line\nregimen, pemetrexed, docetaxel or immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nWhat is Optune Lua® approved to treat?\nOptune Lua is a wearable, portable, FDA-approved device used together with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (immunotherapy) or\ndocetaxel. It is indicated for adult patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) who have progressed\non or after a platinum-based regimen.\nImportant Safety Information\nWho should not use Optune Lua?\nOptune Lua for mNSCLC is not for everyone. Talk to your doctor if you have:\n• An electrical implant. Use of Optune Lua together with electrical implants has not been tested and may cause\nthe implanted device not to work properly\n• A known sensitivity to gels like the gel used on electrocardiogram (ECG) stickers or transcutaneous electrical\nnerve stimulation (TENS) electrodes. In this case, skin contact with the gel used with Optune Lua may commonly\ncause increased redness and itching, and rarely may even lead to severe allergies such as a fall in blood\npressure and difficulty breathing\nDo not use Optune Lua if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. It is not known if Optune Lua is\nsafe or effective during pregnancy.\nExhibit 99.1\nWhat should I know before using Optune Lua?\nOptune Lua should only be used after receiving training from qualified personnel, such as your doctor, a nurse, or other\nmedical staff who have completed a training course given by Novocure®, the maker of Optune Lua.\n• Do not use any parts that did not come with Optune Lua Treatment Kit sent to you by Novocure or given to you by\nyour doctor\n• Do not get the device or transducer arrays wet\n• Please be aware that Optune Lua has a cord that plugs into an electrical socket. Be careful of tripping when it's\nconnected\n• If you have an underlying serious skin condition where the transducer arrays are placed, discuss with your doctor\nwhether this may prevent or temporarily interfere with Optune Lua treatment\nWhat are the possible side effects of Optune Lua?\nThe most common side effects of Optune Lua when used together with certain immunotherapy and chemotherapy drugs\nwere dermatitis, pain in the muscles, bones, or joints, fatigue, anemia, alopecia (hair loss), dyspnea, nausea, cough,\ndiarrhea, anorexia, pruritus (itching), leukopenia, pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, localized edema (swelling), rash,\npain, constipation, skin ulcers, hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels),\nhyponatremia (low sodium levels), and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)\nOther potential adverse effects associated with the use of Optune Lua include treatment related skin irritation, allergic\nreaction to the adhesive or to the gel, overheating of the array leading to pain and/or local skin burns, infections at site\nwhere the arrays make contact with the skin, local warmth and tingling sensation beneath the arrays, medical device site\nreaction, muscle twitching, and skin breakdown/skin ulcer. Talk to your doctor if you have any of these side effects or\nquestions.\nAbout Tumor Treating Fields\nTumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are electric fields that exert physical forces to kill cancer cells via a variety of\nmechanisms. TTFields do not significantly affect healthy cells because they have different properties (including division\nrate, morphology, and electrical properties) than cancer cells. These multiple, distinct mechanisms work together to\ntarget and kill cancer cells. Due to these multimechanistic actions, TTFields therapy can be added to cancer treatment\nmodalities in approved indications and demonstrates enhanced effects across solid tumor types when used with\nchemotherapy, radiotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibition, or targeted therapies in preclinical models. TTFields therapy\nprovides clinical versatility that has the potential to help address treatment challenges across a range of solid tumors.\nExhibit 99.1\nTo learn more about TTFields therapy and its multifaceted effect on cancer cells, visit tumortreatingfields.com.\nAbout Novocure\nNovocure is a global oncology company working to extend survival in some of the most aggressive forms of cancer\nthrough the development and commercialization of its innovative therapy, Tumor Treating Fields.

He hoped to leverage his expertise in biophysics\nto develop a new way to treat solid tumor cancers that would destroy tumor\ncells while sparing healthy tissue and avoiding many of the life-altering side\neffects of existing cancer therapies. Professor Palti’s since-proven hypothesis\nwas based on the use of alternating electric fields, which can kill cancer cells\nwhen applied at specific frequencies. This breakthrough ultimately led to the\ndevelopment of our innovative therapy, Tumor Treating Fields, or TTFields.\nNovocure’s patient-forward approach continues to drive our mission today –\ntogether with our patients, we strive to extend survival in some of the most\naggressive forms of cancer through the development and commercialization\nof Tumor Treating Fields. We have over 1,300 team members and operations\nin multiple countries across North America, Europe and Asia.

Electric fields have different effects on\nthe human body depending on their frequency, leading to diverse\napplications in healthcare such as microwave ablation, deep brain\nTTFIELDS 100 TO 500 KHZ\nstimulation, and pacemakers. Cancer cells contain polar cellular\ncomponents that can be influenced by electric fields – introducing\nexciting possibilities for solid tumor treatment.\nTTFields employ electric fields at a frequency range of 100 kHz to 500\nkHz. The unique frequency range of TTFields allows the electric fields\nto be generated through the cancer cell membrane, while a lower\nfrequency would not. The relatively high frequency range and low\nintensity allow TTFields to avoid depolarizing nerves or muscle, or having\nTUMOR CELL HEALTHY CELL\nsignificant heating effects.\nTTFields have multiple, distinct mechanisms of action that work\ntogether to selectively target and kill cancer cells. These includes the\nability to disrupt cancer cell mitosis, an enhancement of antitumor\nimmunity, interference with cancer cell motility and migration, and the\ndownregulation of genes important for cancer cell DNA damage repair.\nTTFields spare healthy cells because they have different properties\n(including division rate, morphology, and electrical properties) than\ncancer cells. Differences in electrical properties occur at the plasma\nmembrane and within the intracellular and extracellular environments,\nand become more pronounced at higher stages of malignancy.\nTTFields therapy’s inherent properties make it clinically versatile. It can\nbe customized via frequencies based on cell type to target a diverse\nrange of solid tumors. TTFields can also be delivered noninvasively and\nlocoregionally through the use of a portal device.\n2022 Novocure environmental, social & governance report 77\nINTRODUCTION ABOUT NOVOCURE PATIENTS EMPLOYEES COMMUNITIES & ENVIRONMENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE QUALITY & SAFETY APPENDIX\nour devices\nNovocure’s commercial devices, Optune® and Optune Lua®, are approved\nin certain countries for the treatment of adult patients with glioblastoma,\nmalignant pleural mesothelioma and pleural mesothelioma.
