(Nasdaq: PMCB) (“PharmaCyte” or the “Company”), today announced a $7 million investment in MyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq:MYMD) (“MyMD”) a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing novel therapies for age-related diseases, autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. MyMD has announced positive data for a 40-patient Phase 2 clinical trial for its lead product, MYMD-1 in sarcopenia, and is moving its clinical program forward in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). PharmaCyte’s investment in externally developed technology solidifies its strategy to prudently apply its approximately $65 million (as of March 31, 2024) cash position. \n\nChris Chapman, M.D., president and chief medical officer of MyMD, stated, “This investment comes at an important inflection point for MyMD, as we are actively preparing to continue our clinical studies in our lead product candidate, MYMD-1, following our positive data from our Phase 2 trial in sarcopenia. We are looking forward to potential collaboration with PharmaCyte, as its management and board have extensive experience in the public biotechnology markets. We believe that this strategic investment will also provide helpful insight as we continue to develop our technology.” \n\n“Our investment in MyMD solidifies our commitment to our previously announced corporate strategy to identify significant outside opportunities where we can create value both through cash investment and our own expertise. MyMD’s approach to inflammation is unlike what is currently available and addresses significant unmet medical needs in this category. We believe we can contribute to its continued development, and we look forward to further collaboration and sharing in MyMD’s success. We anticipate continuing to seek out additional opportunities which we hope will ultimately result in marked value for PharmaCyte and its stockholders,” said Dr. Michael Abecassis, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. \n\n**About MyMD**\n\nMyMD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYMD), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to extending healthy lifespan, is focused on developing two novel therapeutic platforms that treat the causes of disease rather than only addressing the symptoms. MYMD-1 is a drug platform based on a clinical stage small molecule that regulates the immune system to control TNF-α, which drives chronic inflammation, and other pro-inflammatory cell signaling cytokines. MYMD-1 is being developed to delay aging, increase longevity, and treat autoimmune diseases. The Company’s second drug platform, Supera-CBD, is being developed to treat chronic pain, addiction and epilepsy. Supera-CBD is a novel synthetic derivative of cannabidiol (CBD) and is being developed to address and improve upon the rapidly growing CBD market, which includes both FDA approved drugs and CBD products not currently regulated as drugs.

The Company is exploring possible utility in cancer (particularly pancreatic), Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes, and malignant ascites. \n\nHowever, until the review by the Business Review Committee and the Board is complete and the Board has determined the actions and plans to be implemented, the Board has curtailed spending on the foregoing programs. \n\n**Safe Harbor**\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that express the current beliefs and expectations of PharmaCyte’s management and Board of Directors.
