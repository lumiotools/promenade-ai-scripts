Using recent advances in AI and analytics, organizations are applying this information to enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, advanced planning systems and control towers for greater supply chain performance and resilience. \n\n“Ongoing business transformation is the top priority for Brazilian enterprise leaders,” said Bob Krohn, partner, manufacturing, for ISG. “They recognize that more flexible, integrated and sustainable supply chains are essential to this vision, and service providers are helping them use AI to realize that vision.” \n\nCompanies in Brazil are taking advantage of higher data volumes as cloud services grow in performance, processing capacity and reliability, the report says. With more structured information at their disposal, enterprises are applying increasingly sophisticated AI and GenAI solutions to a wider range of applications. Deployments are expanding beyond sales and planning to include core industrial manufacturing and operations applications, such as predictive maintenance. \n\nThe AI and GenAI tools being deployed in Brazil make data about logistics, distribution, sales and product replenishment more useful for predicting and responding to sales peaks and abnormal movement of materials, ISG says. They give enterprises more visibility and levers to manage the extended supply chain, stretching all the way from suppliers to consumers, which makes it easier to carry out circular economy initiatives that reduce waste. \n\nSince emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, many Brazilian companies have accelerated efforts to outpace competitors in performance and efficiency, the report says. A growing number of them are partnering with supply chain advisory and consulting providers for activities that include diagnosing supply chain issues, crafting strategies, implementing systems and reducing cost and risk. Given Brazil’s land area — the fifth largest in the world — distribution solutions such as control towers and warehouse and transportation management systems are in especially high demand. \n\n“Visibility and control throughout the supply chain are more important than ever,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “Brazilian companies are sharply focused on AI and analytics solutions to achieve those objectives.” \n\nThe report also examines other supply chain trends in Brazil, including the rising demand for supply chain BPO services and emerging interest in circular supply chains for improved sustainability. \n\nFor more insights into the supply chain challenges faced by enterprises in Brazil, see the ISG Provider Lens ™ Focal Points briefing [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fei.isg-one.com%2FResearch%2F_MarketingPage%3FdashboardID%3D201a11ca-c115-4a33-a9f7-941eceefbbd1%26documentId%3DjfJlD06cD3%26isLocked%3Dfalse&esheet=54158766&newsitemid=20241127716971&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=3&md5=132d0d7d3e4a99b2b1494f81e33109fb). \n\nThe 2024 ISG Provider Lens ™ Supply Chain Services report for Brazil evaluates the capabilities of 40 providers across four quadrants: Supply Chain Advisory and Consulting Services, Supply Chain IT Operations Services, Supply Chain BPO Services and Circular Supply Chain Services. \n\nThe report names Accenture as a Leader in all four quadrants. It names EY as a Leader in three quadrants and IBM and Tech Mahindra as Leaders in two quadrants each. Deloitte, ILOS, McKinsey, Stefanini, TCS and Xcelis Solutions are named as Leaders in one quadrant each. \n\nIn addition, Alvarez & Marsal is named as a Rising Star — a company with a “promising portfolio” and “high future potential” by ISG’s definition — in two quadrants. BRQ and PwC are named as Rising Stars in one quadrant each. \n\nA customized version of the report is available from [Accenture](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.accenture.com%2Fbr-pt%2Fservices%2Fsupply-chain-management-and-operations-index&esheet=54158766&newsitemid=20241127716971&lan=en-US&anchor=Accenture&index=4&md5=8ccfc2558c76159ac112395fc1dd25af). \n\nIn the area of customer experience, Genpact is named the global ISG CX Star Performer for 2024 among supply chain services providers.

This is expanding the need for consulting, cloud migration assistance, managed services and other offerings from the growing AWS provider ecosystem in Mexico. \n\n“Digital transformation is a growing trend in Mexico as companies strategically use data and the cloud to become more innovative,” said Anay Nawathe, ISG cloud delivery lead for the Americas. “Service providers are often the key to making these initiatives possible.” \n\nMexican enterprises are increasingly pursuing application modernization and cloud-native development, which allow them to develop scalable, resilient applications and take advantage of innovations such as AI, and big data. This is driving up demand for professional services in containerization, microservices and other technologies, the report says. \n\nMany enterprises in Mexico are choosing AWS as their cloud infrastructure provider, making it a leading player in the country, ISG says. Most Mexican organizations still consolidate all their services in a single cloud to avoid the complexity of managing multiple platforms. The multicloud strategies commonly used in other markets have not been widely embraced in Mexico, but it is likely Mexican companies will begin to consider hybrid and multicloud approaches to take advantage of each platform’s specific benefits. \n\nData governance is a high priority for Mexican enterprises, and AWS managed service providers are helping clients modernize their data foundations for transparency, advanced analytics and compliance with local regulations, the report says. Enterprises are also embracing FinOps solutions to make their cloud costs more controlled and predictable. \n\nAs more organizations in Mexico use data analytics to optimize processes and generate strategic insights for better decision-making, AI and ML adoption is growing quickly, the report says. The market is still at a moderate stage of maturity in this area, but GenAI is attracting attention from more enterprises. AWS ecosystem providers are expanding their technical skills to conduct GenAI proofs of concept in areas such as improving operational efficiency and customer experience. \n\n“Mexican enterprises want to create trusted data environments to support a wide range of AI and ML initiatives,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “Leading AWS partners are helping to ensure clients’ data is reliable and accessible.” \n\nThe report also examines other trends in the Mexican AWS market, including companies’ accelerated efforts to secure their data and the growing demand for migrating SAP workloads to AWS infrastructure. \n\nFor more insights into the cloud-related challenges faced by Mexican enterprises, see the ISG Provider Lens™ Focal Points briefing [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fei.isg-one.com%2FResearch%2F_MarketingPage%3FdashboardID%3D201a11ca-c115-4a33-a9f7-941eceefbbd1%26documentId%3DsmiJg04WsU&esheet=54158122&newsitemid=20241126575931&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=3&md5=dc4a9e7e9c615d3d5c5b572b80e69b83). \n\nThe 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ AWS Ecosystem Partners report for Mexico evaluates the capabilities of 32 providers across four quadrants: AWS Professional Services, AWS Managed Services, AWS Data Analytics, AI and ML, and AWS SAP Workloads. \n\nThe report names Accenture and Rackspace Technology as Leaders in all four quadrants. It names NTT DATA, Telmex and XaIDigital as Leaders in three quadrants each. Compucloud, EPAM Systems, Escala 24x7 and Itera are named as Leaders in two quadrants each. EPI-USE, Seidor and T-Systems are named as Leaders in one quadrant each. \n\nIn addition, Clouxter, Escala 24x7 and Tesselar are named as Rising Stars — companies with a “promising portfolio” and “high future potential” by ISG’s definition — in one quadrant each. \n\nA customized version of the report is available from [Escala 24x7](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.escala24x7.com%2Fisg-provider-lens&esheet=54158122&newsitemid=20241126575931&lan=en-US&anchor=Escala+24x7&index=4&md5=6e61b5d320f2ec0a809e2a80d3acdbf7). \n\nIn the area of customer experience, Persistent Systems is named the global ISG CX Star Performer for 2024 among AWS ecosystem providers.

The geographically focused reports will cover providers offering multiprocess HRO, health and welfare benefits administration and workforce recruitment services. \n\nEnterprise buyers will be able to use information from the reports to evaluate their current vendor relationships, potential new engagements and available offerings, while ISG advisors use the information to recommend providers to the firm’s buy-side clients. \n\nTransformational HRO goes beyond HR’s traditional focus on process standardization, efficiency and cost reduction, to create and deliver value to the entire organization and its employees. This approach enables enterprises to accelerate their adoption of advanced digital technologies, including AI, and broaden the scope of their HR offerings through partner networks. HRO at this level delivers actionable, data-driven insights that enable organizations to make better informed decisions and significantly boost employee engagement. \n\n“Organizations are navigating a landscape of evolving HR needs, rapid technological advances and significant shifts in workforce demographics, values and expectations,” said Namratha Dharshan, chief business leader, ISG Research. “To help them meet their strategic business objectives and enhance workforce outcomes, enterprises are turning to providers to create new, digitally enabled HR service delivery models that are agile, flexible, resilient and efficient.” \n\nISG has distributed surveys to nearly 70 HRO providers serving the U.S. and global markets. Working in collaboration with ISG’s global advisors, the research team will produce three quadrants representing the transformational HRO services the typical enterprise is buying based on ISG’s experience working with its clients. The three quadrants are: \n\n  * **Multiprocess HRO (MPHRO) Services** , evaluating providers of integrated services including core workforce data administration, recruitment support, contact center, compensation, leave administration and payroll and performance management. Delivered business value includes cost reduction, service quality improvement and organizational agility, flexibility and resilience. \n  * **Health and Welfare (H &W) Benefits Administration Services** , assessing providers managing benefits for employees and other eligible dependents. These providers help organizations facilitate enrollment in H&W plans, verify employee and dependent eligibility for benefits programs and manage and streamline ongoing administration to enhance employee experience. \n  * **Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO)** , studying providers of end-to-end services that help organizations better manage their recruitment lifecycles. These providers help clients identify key recruitment needs, streamline talent sourcing and develop effective candidate screening processes, often using AI and data analytics to reduce cycle times and improve the quality of recruits. \n\n\n\nGeographically focused reports from the study will cover the transformational HRO services market and examine products and services available in the U.S. and globally. ISG analyst Gaurang Pagdi will serve as lead author of both reports. \n\nA list of identified providers and vendors and further details on the study are available in [this digital brochure](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fisg-one.com%2Fdocs%2Fdefault-source%2F2025-ipl-brochures%2Fhro_english_brochure_2025.pdf%3Fsfvrsn%3D7137ab31_1&esheet=54156499&newsitemid=20241121830162&lan=en-US&anchor=this+digital+brochure&index=3&md5=deaa4a1ebf959602f2287083cae1b0e1). Companies not listed as transformational HRO service providers can contact ISG and ask to be included in the study. \n\nAll 2025 ISG Provider Lens™ evaluations feature expanded customer experience (CX) data that measures actual enterprise experience with specific provider services and solutions, based on ISG’s continuous CX research. Enterprise customers wishing to share their experience about a specific provider or vendor are invited to complete this [online survey](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurveys.isg-one.com%2Fsurvey%2Fselfserve%2F48f8%2F241010%3Flist%3D1%26user_company%3D%24user_company%26user_fname%3D%24user_fname%26user_lname%3D%24user_lname%26user_email%3D%24user_email%26uu_id%3D%24uu_id%23%3F&esheet=54156499&newsitemid=20241121830162&lan=en-US&anchor=online+survey&index=4&md5=d708837b303c0e6fdad097fae994b8d9).
