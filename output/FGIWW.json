(Nasdaq: FGI) (\"FGI\" or the \"Company\"), a leading global supplier of kitchen and bath products, today announced results for the third quarter 2024.\n\n[ ![FGI Industries, Ltd. \\(PRNewsfoto/FGI Industries Ltd.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1774923/FGI_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1774923/FGI_Logo.html)\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS** _(As compared to the third quarter of 2023)_\n\n  * Total revenue of $36.1 million, +20.6% y/y\n  * Gross profit of $9.3 million, +18.9% y/y\n  * Gross margin of 25.8%, -40 bps y/y\n  * Operating loss of ($0.1) million and net loss attributable to shareholders of ($0.6) million\n  * Adjusted operating income of $0.1 million\n  * Adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of ($0.1) million\n\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY**\n\nDave Bruce, President and CEO of FGI, stated, \"FGI reported total revenue of $36.1 million in the quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 20.6%. Gross profit was a record $9.3 million, reflecting growth of 18.9% compared to the prior year. The gross margin was 25.8%, a decline of 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023 due, in part, to a higher mix of Sanitaryware and Bath Furniture and higher freight costs in the Bath Furniture and Covered Bridge segments. The industry outlook remains relatively flat overall with our customers forecasting minimal growth in 2024 but FGI's strategic investments in our brands, products and channels strategy is bearing fruit driving revenue growth well above the overall market. FGI's third quarter revenue increased significantly compared to the third quarter 2023 due to growth across all our businesses and geographies. Revenue grew 21%, 9% and 39% in the quarter for the US, Canada and Europe markets, respectively. Sanitaryware and Bath Furniture reversed year-over-year declines in the second quarter and grew 3% and 64%, respectively, in the third quarter. Shower Systems revenue increased 45% year-over-year as demand trends remained steady and sales of both existing and new products drove growth. Our Covered Bridge custom cabinet segment continues to show strong growth increasing 93% over the prior year period.\" Bruce continued, \"We are excited about our new product introductions and continue to invest in our brands and our future growth initiatives in our core businesses.\"\n\nPerry Lin, Chief Financial Officer of FGI, commented, \"Even as total revenue increased 20.6% year-over-year, operating expenses increased 27.6% year-over-year to $9.4 million. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to investing for future growth in our kitchen cabinet business, which includes Covered Bridge and Isla Porter, and investing in distribution for our Canada business. FGI ended the third quarter with total available liquidity of $16.3 million. We believe the best use of our capital is for internal investment and this will remain our priority in the near term.\"\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS**\n\nRevenue totaled $36.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 20.6% compared to the prior-year period due to growth across all our businesses and geographies. \n\n  * Sanitaryware revenue was $21.5 million during the third quarter of 2024, up from $20.7 million in the prior-year period. \n  * Bath Furniture revenue was $4.2 million during the third quarter of 2024, an increase from revenue of $2.5 million in the prior-year period. Our shift to market-aligned program pricing and design outpaced our sales expectations. \n  * Shower Systems revenue was $7.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, up from $4.9 million last year. Demand trends remain positive, further supported by our new customer programs. \n  * Other revenue, primarily from Kitchen Cabinets, was $3.3 million during the third quarter, up from $1.7 million in the prior year, driven by continued strong dealer and customer expansion across the US.\n\n\n\nGross profit was $9.3 million during the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 18.9% compared to last year, driven by growth in our higher margin products. Gross profit margin decreased to 25.8% during the third quarter of 2024, down 40 basis points from the prior-year period. \n\nOperating loss was ($0.1) million during the third quarter of 2024, down from operating income of $0.5 million in the prior-year period. Operating loss during the third quarter of 2024 included non-recurring expenses of $0.1 million for business expansion expense and accruals for non-recurring IPO- related stock-based compensation. Excluding these items, adjusted operating income was 0.1 million during the third quarter. The decline in operating income and adjusted operating income from the prior year was a result of an increase in personnel costs, marketing and promotion expenses, warehouse expenses, and operating expenses tied to growth initiatives, as the Company continues to invest in its BPC growth strategy. As a result, operating margin and adjusted operating margin were (0.2%) and 0.2% during the third quarter, respectively, down from 1.6% and 2.0% in the same period last year.\n\nThe Company reported GAAP net loss attributable to shareholders of ($0.6) million, or ($0.06) per diluted share during the third quarter of 2024, versus net income of $0.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included after-tax expenses of $0.1 million related to business expansion expense and accruals for non-recurring IPO- related stock-based compensation. Net loss for the third quarter of 2023 included after-tax expense of $0.1 million related to business expansion expense and non-recurring IPO- related compensation. Excluding these items, adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 was ($0.1) million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, versus adjusted net income attributable to shareholders of $0.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the same period last year. \n\n**FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $3.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, total debt of $12.5 million and $13.3 million of availability under its credit facilities net of letters of credit. Total liquidity was $16.3 million at September 30, 2024.\n\n**FINANCIAL GUIDANCE**\n\nThe Company revises its fiscal 2024 guidance as follows:\n\n  * Revised total revenue of $127-131 million, up from the previous estimate of $115-128 million.\n  * Revised total adjusted operating income of ($1.0) to $0.0 million, down from the previous estimate of $2.8 to $3.8 million.\n  * Revised total adjusted net income of ($1.0) to $0.0 million, compared to the prior estimate of $1.2 to $2.0 million.\n\n\n\nNote that Total Adjusted Operating Income excludes certain non-recurring items and Total Adjusted Net Income excludes certain non-recurring extraordinary items and includes an adjustment for minority interest.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nFGI will conduct a conference call on Tuesday, November 12 at 9:00 am Eastern Time to discuss the quarterly results.\n\nA webcast of the conference call and accompanying presentation materials will be available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's corporate website at _<https://investor.fgi-industries.com>_.

(Nasdaq: FGI) is a leading global supplier of kitchen and bath products. For over 30 years, we have built an industry-wide reputation for product innovation, quality, and excellent customer service. We are currently focused on the following product categories: sanitaryware (primarily toilets, sinks, pedestals, and toilet seats), bath furniture (vanities, mirrors and cabinets), shower systems, customer kitchen cabinetry and other accessory items. These products are sold primarily for repair and remodel activity and, to a lesser extent, new home or commercial construction. We sell our products through numerous partners, including mass retail centers, wholesale and commercial distributors, online retailers and specialty stores.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP measures to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. Our non-GAAP measures are: Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margins and Adjusted Net Income. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). They are supplemental financial measures of our performance only, and should not be considered substitutes for net income, income from operations or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other entities. We define Adjusted Operating Income as GAAP income from operations excluding the impact of certain non-recurring expenses, including non-recurring compensation expenses related to our IPO, unusual litigation and business expansion expense. We define Adjusted Net Income as GAAP net income excluding the tax-effected impact of certain non-recurring expenses and income such as unusual litigation fees and non-recurring compensation expenses related to our IPO. We define Adjusted Operating Margins as adjusted income from operations divided by revenue.\n\nWe use these non-GAAP measures, along with U.S. GAAP measures, to evaluate our business, measure our financial performance and profitability and our ability to manage expenses, after adjusting for certain one-time expenses, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. We believe these non-GAAP measures, when reviewed in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures, and not in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations under U.S. GAAP, are useful to investors as they are widely used measures of performance and the adjustments we make to these non-GAAP measures provide investors further insight into our profitability and additional perspectives in comparing our performance over time on a consistent basis. With respect to the Company's expectations of its future performance, the Company's reconciliations of full year 2024 Adjusted Operating Income and 2024 Adjusted Net Income are not available, as the Company is unable to quantify certain amounts to the degree of precision that would be required in the relevant GAAP measures without unreasonable effort.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: FGI) (\"FGI\" or the \"Company\"), a leading global supplier of kitchen and bath products, today announced results for the second quarter 2024.\n\n[ ![FGI Industries, Ltd. \\(PRNewsfoto/FGI Industries Ltd.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1774923/FGI_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1774923/FGI_Logo.html)\n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS** _(As compared to the second quarter of 2023)_\n\n  * Total revenue of $29.4 million, +0.6% y/y\n  * Gross profit of $9.0 million, +11.9% y/y\n  * Gross margin of 30.5%, +310 bps y/y\n  * Operating loss of ($0.5) million and net loss of ($0.0) million\n  * Adjusted operating loss of ($0.3) million\n  * Adjusted net income of $0.1 million\n\n\n\n**MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY**\n\nDave Bruce, President and CEO of FGI, stated, \"FGI reported total revenue of $29.4 million in the quarter, representing a year-over-year increase of 0.6%. Gross profit was $9.0 million, reflecting growth of 11.9% compared to the prior year. The gross margin improved to 30.5%, an increase of 310 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2023. The industry outlook remains relatively flat overall with our customers forecasting minimal growth in 2024. FGI's second quarter revenue was largely unchanged compared to second quarter 2023 results due, in part, to our transition to SAP enterprise software and overseas logistics challenges. Our Sanitaryware and Bath Furniture revenue declined 8% and 16% year-over-year, respectively. We expect the delayed shipments to be completed in the second half of the year. Shower Systems revenue increased by 37% year-over-year as demand trends remain steady and sales of both existing and new products continue to drive organic growth. Our Covered Bridge custom cabinet segment showed strong growth, increasing 66% year over year.\" Bruce continued, \"Geographically, we remain optimistic about India and opened an office in India during the quarter. We are excited about our new product introductions and continue to invest in our brands and our future growth initiatives.\"\n\nPerry Lin, Chief Financial Officer of FGI, commented, \"FGI ended the second quarter with total available liquidity of $17.4 million. Our operating expenses increased due to investing in future growth combined with the effects of inflation and an increase in freight rates. We expect operating expenses to decline sequentially in the second half of the year as certain expenses incurred in the first half will not recur in the second half of the year. We continue to carefully monitor freight costs. We believe the best use of our capital is for internal investment and this will remain our priority in the near term.\"\n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2024 RESULTS**\n\nRevenue totaled $29.4 million during the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 0.6% compared to the prior-year period, driven by increased volume in Shower systems and a normalization of inventory levels. \n\n  * Sanitaryware revenue was $17.3 million during the second quarter of 2024, down from $18.8 million in the prior-year period. The revenue decrease was impacted by the delayed shipments in the second quarter.\n  * Bath Furniture revenue was $4.0 million during the second quarter of 2024, a decline from revenue of $4.8 million in the prior-year period. The bath furniture market continues to be impacted by macro headwinds and a trade-down to lower ticket products.\n  * Shower Systems revenue was $5.9 million during the second quarter of 2024, up from $4.3 million last year. The revenue increase was driven by recently launched programs and orders from a broader customer base.\n  * Other revenue, primarily from Kitchen Cabinets, was $2.1 million during the second quarter, up from $1.3 million in the prior year, driven by continued order momentum.\n\n\n\nGross profit was $9.0 million during the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 11.9% compared to last year, driven by growth in our higher margin products. Gross profit margin improved to 30.5% during the second quarter of 2024, up 310 basis points from the prior-year period. \n\nOperating loss was ($0.5) million during the second quarter of 2024, down from $0.6 million in the prior-year period. Operating loss during the second quarter of 2024 included non-recurring expenses of $0.1 million for business expansion expense and accruals for non-recurring IPO- related stock-based compensation. Excluding these items, adjusted operating loss was ($0.3) million during the second quarter. The decline in operating income was a result of an increase in personnel costs, marketing and promotion expenses, warehouse expenses, and operating expenses tied to growth initiatives, as the Company continues to invest in its BPC growth strategy. As a result, adjusted operating margin was (1.1%) during the second quarter, down from 2.4% in the same period last year.\n\nThe Company reported GAAP net loss ($0.0) million, or ($0.00) per diluted share during the second quarter of 2024, versus net income of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same period last year. Net loss for the second quarter of 2024 included after-tax expenses of $0.1 million related to business expansion expense and accruals for non-recurring IPO- related stock-based compensation. Net loss for the second quarter of 2023 included after-tax expense of $0.1 million related to business expansion expense and non-recurring IPO- related compensation. Excluding these items, adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2024 was $0.1 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, versus adjusted net income of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the same period last year. \n\n**FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had $1.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, total debt of $9.7 million and $16.1 million of availability under its credit facilities net of letters of credit. Total liquidity was $17.4 million at June 30, 2024.\n\n**FINANCIAL GUIDANCE**\n\nThe Company reiterates its fiscal 2024 guidance as follows:\n\n  * Total Revenue between $115 million and $128 million\n  * Total Adjusted Operating Income between $2.8 million and $3.8 million\n  * Total Adjusted Net Income between $1.2 million to $2.0 million\n\n\n\nGuidance for adjusted operating income and adjusted net income is presented on an adjusted basis and excludes non-recurring items. All guidance is current as of the time provided and is subject to change.\n\n**SECOND QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nFGI will conduct a conference call on Thursday, August 8 at 9:00 am Eastern Time to discuss the quarterly results.\n\nA webcast of the conference call and accompanying presentation materials will be available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's corporate website at _<https://investor.fgi-industries.com>_.

(Nasdaq: FGI) is a leading global supplier of kitchen and bath products. For over 30 years, we have built an industry-wide reputation for product innovation, quality, and excellent customer service. We are currently focused on the following product categories: sanitaryware (primarily toilets, sinks, pedestals, and toilet seats), bath furniture (vanities, mirrors and cabinets), shower systems, customer kitchen cabinetry and other accessory items. These products are sold primarily for repair and remodel activity and, to a lesser extent, new home or commercial construction. We sell our products through numerous partners, including mass retail centers, wholesale and commercial distributors, online retailers and specialty stores.\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP measures to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. Our non-GAAP measures are: Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margins and Adjusted Net Income. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). They are supplemental financial measures of our performance only, and should not be considered substitutes for net income, income from operations or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other entities. We define Adjusted Operating Income as GAAP income from operations excluding the impact of certain non-recurring expenses, including expenses related to COVID‑19 protocols, non-recurring compensation expenses related to our IPO, and one-time anti-dumping penalty expenses. We define Adjusted Net Income as GAAP net income excluding the tax-effected impact of certain non-recurring expenses and income such as expenses related to COVID‑19 protocols, unusual litigation fees and non-recurring compensation expenses related to our IPO. We define Adjusted Operating Margins as adjusted income from operations divided by revenue.\n\nWe use these non-GAAP measures, along with U.S. GAAP measures, to evaluate our business, measure our financial performance and profitability and our ability to manage expenses, after adjusting for certain one-time expenses, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. We believe these non-GAAP measures, when reviewed in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures, and not in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations under U.S. GAAP, are useful to investors as they are widely used measures of performance and the adjustments we make to these non-GAAP measures provide investors further insight into our profitability and additional perspectives in comparing our performance over time on a consistent basis. With respect to the Company's expectations of its future performance, the Company's reconciliations of full year 2024 Adjusted Operating Income and 2024 Adjusted Net Income are not available, as the Company is unable to quantify certain amounts to the degree of precision that would be required in the relevant GAAP measures without unreasonable effort.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The use of words such as \"anticipate,\" \"expect,\" \"could,\" \"may,\" \"intend,\" \"plan\", \"see\" and \"believe,\" among others, generally identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding FGI's guidance, the Company's growth strategies, outlook and potential acquisition activity, the macroeconomic instability and its associated impact on the national and global economy and the residential repair and remodel market, the company's planned product launches and new customer partnerships, the effect of supply chain disruptions and freight costs and estimates of customer de-stock and timing of market recoveries. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial, economic and other information, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual future events or results. A variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause actual future results or events to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements in this release. For a full description of the risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, please refer to FGI's periodic filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission including those described as \"Risk Factors\" in FGI's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed thereafter.

laws.\n\n**FGI INDUSTRIES LTD.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n---  \n**As of** | **As of**  \n**June 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**USD** | **USD**  \n**(Unaudited)**

          "content": "FGI INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nEAST HANOVER, N.J., November 11, 2024 – FGI Industries Ltd. (Nasdaq: FGI) (“FGI” or the “Company”), a leading\nglobal supplier of kitchen and bath products, today announced results for the third quarter 2024.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS\n(As compared to the third quarter of 2023)\n▪ Total revenue of $36.1 million, +20.6% y/y\n▪ Gross profit of $9.3 million, +18.9% y/y\n▪ Gross margin of 25.8%, -40 bps y/y\n▪ Operating loss of ($0.1) million and net loss attributable to shareholders of ($0.6) million\n▪ Adjusted operating income of $0.1 million\n▪ Adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of ($0.1) million\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\nDave Bruce, President and CEO of FGI, stated, “FGI reported total revenue of $36.1 million in the quarter,\nrepresenting a year-over-year increase of 20.6%. Gross profit was a record $9.3 million, reflecting growth of 18.9%\ncompared to the prior year. The gross margin was 25.8%, a decline of 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of\n2023 due, in part, to a higher mix of Sanitaryware and Bath Furniture and higher freight costs in the Bath Furniture\nand Covered Bridge segments. The industry outlook remains relatively flat overall with our customers forecasting\nminimal growth in 2024 but FGI’s strategic investments in our brands, products and channels strategy is bearing fruit\ndriving revenue growth well above the overall market. FGI’s third quarter revenue increased significantly compared to\nthe third quarter 2023 due to growth across all our businesses and geographies. Revenue grew 21%, 9% and 39% in\nthe quarter for the US, Canada and Europe markets, respectively. Sanitaryware and Bath Furniture reversed year-\nover-year declines in the second quarter and grew 3% and 64%, respectively, in the third quarter. Shower Systems\nrevenue increased 45% year-over-year as demand trends remained steady and sales of both existing and new\nproducts drove growth. Our Covered Bridge custom cabinet segment continues to show strong growth increasing 93%\nover the prior year period.” Bruce continued, “We are excited about our new product introductions and continue to\ninvest in our brands and our future growth initiatives in our core businesses.”\nPerry Lin, Chief Financial Officer of FGI, commented, “Even as total revenue increased 20.6% year-over-year,\noperating expenses increased 27.6% year-over-year to $9.4 million. The increase in operating expenses was due\nprimarily to investing for future growth in our kitchen cabinet business, which includes Covered Bridge and Isla Porter,\nand investing in distribution for our Canada business. FGI ended the third quarter with total available liquidity of $16.3\nmillion. We believe the best use of our capital is for internal investment and this will remain our priority in the near\nterm.”\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nRevenue totaled $36.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 20.6% compared to the prior-year\nperiod due to growth across all our businesses and geographies.\n• Sanitaryware revenue was $21.5 million during the third quarter of 2024, up from $20.7 million in the prior-\nyear period.\n• Bath Furniture revenue was $4.2 million during the third quarter of 2024, an increase from revenue of $2.5\nmillion in the prior-year period. Our shift to market-aligned program pricing and design outpaced our sales\nexpectations.\n• Shower Systems revenue was $7.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, up from $4.9 million last year.\nDemand trends remain positive, further supported by our new customer programs.\n• Other revenue, primarily from Kitchen Cabinets, was $3.3 million during the third quarter, up from $1.7 million\nin the prior year, driven by continued strong dealer and customer expansion across the US.\nGross profit was $9.3 million during the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 18.9% compared to last year, driven by\ngrowth in our higher margin products. Gross profit margin decreased to 25.8% during the third quarter of 2024, down\n40 basis points from the prior-year period.\nOperating loss was ($0.1) million during the third quarter of 2024, down from operating income of $0.5 million in the\nprior-year period. Operating loss during the third quarter of 2024 included non-recurring expenses of $0.1 million for\nbusiness expansion expense and accruals for non-recurring IPO- related stock-based compensation. Excluding these\nitems, adjusted operating income was 0.1 million during the third quarter. The decline in operating income and\nadjusted operating income from the prior year was a result of an increase in personnel costs, marketing and\npromotion expenses, warehouse expenses, and operating expenses tied to growth initiatives, as the Company\ncontinues to invest in its BPC growth strategy. As a result, operating margin and adjusted operating margin were\n(0.2%) and 0.2% during the third quarter, respectively, down from 1.6% and 2.0% in the same period last year.\nThe Company reported GAAP net loss attributable to shareholders of ($0.6) million, or ($0.06) per diluted share\nduring the third quarter of 2024, versus net income of $0.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same period last\nyear. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included after-tax expenses of $0.1 million related to business expansion\nexpense and accruals for non-recurring IPO- related stock-based compensation. Net loss for the third quarter of 2023\nincluded after-tax expense of $0.1 million related to business expansion expense and non-recurring IPO- related\ncompensation. Excluding these items, adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders for the third quarter of 2024 was\n($0.1) million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, versus adjusted net income attributable to shareholders of $0.6 million, or\n$0.06 per diluted share, for the same period last year.\nFINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $3.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, total debt of $12.5 million and\n$13.3 million of availability under its credit facilities net of letters of credit. Total liquidity was $16.3 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nFINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nThe Company revises its fiscal 2024 guidance as follows:\n• Revised total revenue of $127-131 million, up from the previous estimate of $115-128 million.\n• Revised total adjusted operating income of ($1.0) to $0.0 million, down from the previous estimate of $2.8 to\n$3.8 million.\n• Revised total adjusted net income of ($1.0) to $0.0 million, compared to the prior estimate of $1.2 to $2.0\nmillion.\nNote that Total Adjusted Operating Income excludes certain non-recurring items and Total Adjusted Net Income\nexcludes certain non-recurring extraordinary items and includes an adjustment for minority interest.\nTHIRD QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL\nFGI will conduct a conference call on Tuesday, November 12 at 9:00 am Eastern Time to discuss the quarterly results.\nA webcast of the conference call and accompanying presentation materials will be available in the Investor Relations\nsection of the Company’s corporate website at https://investor.fgi-industries.com.

(Nasdaq: FGI) is a leading global supplier of kitchen and bath products. For over 30 years, we\nhave built an industry-wide reputation for product innovation, quality, and excellent customer service. We are currently\nfocused on the following product categories: sanitaryware (primarily toilets, sinks, pedestals, and toilet seats), bath\nfurniture (vanities, mirrors and cabinets), shower systems, customer kitchen cabinetry and other accessory items.\nThese products are sold primarily for repair and remodel activity and, to a lesser extent, new home or commercial\nconstruction. We sell our products through numerous partners, including mass retail centers, wholesale and\ncommercial distributors, online retailers and specialty stores.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP\nmeasures to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in\nmaking strategic decisions. Our non-GAAP measures are: Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margins\nand Adjusted Net Income. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). They are supplemental financial measures of our\nperformance only, and should not be considered substitutes for net income, income from operations or any other\nmeasure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other\nentities. We define Adjusted Operating Income as GAAP income from operations excluding the impact of certain non-\nrecurring expenses, including non-recurring compensation expenses related to our IPO, unusual litigation and\nbusiness expansion expense. We define Adjusted Net Income as GAAP net income excluding the tax-effected impact\nof certain non-recurring expenses and income such as unusual litigation fees and non-recurring compensation\nexpenses related to our IPO. We define Adjusted Operating Margins as adjusted income from operations divided by\nrevenue.\nWe use these non-GAAP measures, along with U.S. GAAP measures, to evaluate our business, measure our\nfinancial performance and profitability and our ability to manage expenses, after adjusting for certain one-time\nexpenses, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. We believe these non-\nGAAP measures, when reviewed in conjunction with U.S. GAAP financial measures, and not in isolation or as\nsubstitutes for analysis of our results of operations under U.S. GAAP, are useful to investors as they are widely used\nmeasures of performance and the adjustments we make to these non-GAAP measures provide investors further\ninsight into our profitability and additional perspectives in comparing our performance over time on a consistent basis.\nWith respect to the Company’s expectations of its future performance, the Company’s reconciliations of full year 2024\nAdjusted Operating Income and 2024 Adjusted Net Income are not available, as the Company is unable to quantify\ncertain amounts to the degree of precision that would be required in the relevant GAAP measures without\nunreasonable effort.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995. The use of words such as “anticipate,” “expect,” “could,” “may,” “intend,” “plan”, “see” and “believe,” among\nothers, generally identify forward-looking statements.

All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than\nstatements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans and our\nobjectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “aim,”\n“anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “design,” “due,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “plan,”\n“predict,” “positioned,” “potential,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” and other similar expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events\nand future trends, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. In addition, statements that “we believe” or similar statements reflect our\nbeliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. We have based these forward- looking statements on our current expectations about future events. While we\nbelieve these expectations are reasonable, such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our\ncontrol. Risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in, or implied by, our forward- looking statements include, but\nare not limited to:\n• the levels of residential repair and remodel activity, and to a lesser extent, new home construction;\n• the effects of inflationary pressures, financial market uncertainty and rising interest rates on the demand for our products, our costs and our ability to\naccess capital;\n• our ability to maintain our strong brands and reputation and to develop innovative products;\n• our ability to maintain our competitive position in our industries;\n• our reliance on key suppliers and customers;\n• the occurrence of public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on domestic and international economic activity,\nconsumer confidence, our production capabilities, our employees and our supply chain;\n• the cost and availability of materials and the imposition of tariffs;\n• risks associated with our international operations and global strategies;\n• our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives;\n• our ability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy and integrate businesses that we may acquire;\n• our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our planned operations and to maintain our listing on Nasdaq;\n• risks associated with our reliance on information systems and technology, and our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from our investments in\nnew technology;\n• our ability to attract, develop and retain talented and diverse personnel;\n• our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our planned operations;\n• regulatory developments in the United States and internationally;\n• our ability to establish and maintain intellectual property protection for our products, as well as our ability to operate our business without infringing\nthe intellectual property rights of others; and\n• other risks and uncertainties, including those listed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, as well as subsequent reports we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) (available at www.sec.gov).\nThese forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about our business and the\nindustry in which we operate, and management’s beliefs and assumptions are not\n3\nTable of Contents\nguarantees of future performance or development and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are in some cases beyond our\ncontrol. In light of the significant uncertainties in these forward-looking statements, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of\nfuture events. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the future results, levels of activity,\nperformance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur at all. You should read this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference and have filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the\nunderstanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result\nof new information, future events or otherwise.\nGENERAL\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the “Company,” “FGI,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to FGI\nIndustries Ltd.\n4\nTable of Contents\nPART I —FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nItem 1.

(formerly Foremost Groups, Inc.) (“FGI Industries”), which operates the kitchen and bath (“K&B”)\nsales and distribution business in the United States and, through its wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary, Foremost International Limited, in Canada, distributed\n100% of the outstanding shares of stock of Foremost Kingbetter Food Equipment Inc. (“FKB”), which operates a separate furniture line of business, to\nForemost Groups Ltd. (“Foremost”), FGI Industries’ sole shareholder; (iii) Foremost contributed the FKB shares to Foremost Home Inc. (“FHI”), a newly-\nformed wholly-owned subsidiary of Foremost; and (iv) Foremost contributed 100% of the outstanding shares of stock of each of FGI Industries, FGI Europe\nInvestment Limited (“FGI Europe”), which, directly and, through its wholly-owned German subsidiary, FGI Germany GmbH & Co., operates the K&B sales\nand distribution business in Europe, and FGI International, which, directly and through its wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary, FGI China, Ltd., operates the\nK&B sales and distribution business in the remainder of the world, K&B product development and sourcing of K&B products in China, to the Company\n(collectively, the “Reorganization”), such that, immediately following the Reorganization, (x) Foremost owns 100% of the equity interests in each of the\nCompany and FHI, (y) the Company owns 100% of the equity interests in each of FGI Industries, FGI Europe and FGI International, which collectively, and\nthrough subsidiaries, operate the K&B business worldwide (the “K&B Business”), and (z) FHI owns 100% of the equity interests in FKB.\nOn January 14, 2022 FGI Industries, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a shared services agreement (the “FHI Shared Services\nAgreement”) with Foremost Home Inc., a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Foremost (“FHI”). Pursuant to the FHI Shared Services Agreement, FGI\nIndustries provides FHI with general and administrative services, information technology systems services and human resources services, as well as warehouse\nspace services and supply chain services in the United States. Under the FHI Shared Services Agreement, FHI will reimburse any reasonable and documented\nout-of-pocket fees incurred by FGI Industries as well as pay a service fee for each service. For warehouse services, FHI will pay FGI Industries a $500,000\nannual fee as well as a fee equal to 4% of gross product sales of all products stored in such warehouses. For all other services provided, FHI will pay a service\nfee equal to the total costs incurred by FGI Industries for such service generally divided by the number of FHI employees relative to FGI Industries employees.\nThe FHI Shared Services Agreement will have an initial term of one year and will renew automatically unless cancelled by either party upon the giving of at\nleast 60 days in advance of the expiration of the then-current term.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into a shared services agreement (the “Worldwide Shared Services Agreement”) with Foremost Worldwide\nCo., Ltd. (“Foremost Worldwide”) pursuant to which Foremost Worldwide provides FGI Industries with general and administrative services, information\ntechnology system services and human resources services, in Taiwan. The terms of the Worldwide Services Agreement as between the service provider and\nrecipient are substantially identical to those of the FHI Shared Services Agreement, including calculation of service fees and termination provisions, with\nForemost Worldwide providing services and FGI Industries paying Foremost Worldwide for such services. On January 1, 2023, the Worldwide Services\nAgreement was amended and restated to include additional digital online and related services.\nThe assets and liabilities have been stated at historical carrying amounts. Only those assets and liabilities that are specifically identifiable to the K&B\nBusiness are included in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive (loss) income consist of all the revenue, costs and expenses of the K&B Business, including allocations to selling and\ndistribution expenses, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses, and which were incurred by FGI but related to the K&B\nBusiness prior to the Reorganization.\nAll revenue and cost of revenue attributable to selling of K&B products were allocated to the Company. Operating expenses were allocated to the\nCompany based on employees and activities that are involved in the K&B Business. Any\n12\nTable of Contents\nexpenses that were not directly attributable to any specific business were allocated to the Company based on the proportion of the number of employees of the\nK&B Business to the total number of employees of both the K&B Business and FHI.\nSince December 2023, the books and records of FHI have been completely separated from FGI Industries. The following table sets forth the revenue, cost\nof revenue and operating expenses that were irrelevant to the K&B Business allocated from FGI Industries to Foremost Home, Inc. for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD USD USD USD\nRevenue $ — $ — $ — $ 991,919\nCost of revenue — — — (768,065)\nGross profit — — — 223,854\nSelling and distribution expenses — — — 45,979\nGeneral and administrative expenses — — — —\nResearch and development expenses — — — —\nIncome from operations $ — $ — $ — $ 269,833\nSince October 2022, the books and records of FGI International have been completely separated from Foremost Worldwide Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of Foremost.\nIncome tax liability is calculated based on a separate return basis as if the K&B Business had filed separate tax returns before the completion of the\nReorganization. Immediately following the Reorganization, the K&B Business began to file separate tax returns and report taxation based on the actual tax\nreturn of each legal entity.\nManagement believes the basis and amounts of these allocations are reasonable. While the expenses allocated to the Company for these items are not\nnecessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if the Company had been a separate, stand-alone entity, the Company does not believe that\nthere is any significant difference between the nature and amounts of these allocated expenses and the expenses that would have been incurred if the Company\nhad been a separate, stand-alone entity.\nNote 2 — Summary of significant accounting policies\nLiquidity\nHistorically, the Company finances its operations through internally generated cash, short-term loans and payables. As of September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had approximately $3.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consists of cash on hand and bank deposits, which are unrestricted as\nto withdrawal and use.\nIf the Company is unable to realize its assets within the normal operating cycle of a twelve (12) month period, the Company may have to consider\nsupplementing its available sources of funds through the following sources:\n•other available sources of financing from other banks and financial institutions;\n•sales of additional securities to the public or other investors; and\n•financial support from the Company’s shareholders.\nBased on the above considerations, the Company’s management is of the opinion that it has sufficient funds to meet the Company’s working capital\nrequirements and debt obligations as they become due over the next twelve (12) months.\nBasis of presentation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commissions (the “SEC”), regarding financial reporting,\nand include all normal and recurring adjustments that management of the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and\noperation results.\n13\nTable of Contents\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant\nintercompany transactions and balances between the Company and its subsidiaries are eliminated upon consolidation.\nSubsidiaries are those entities which the Company, directly or indirectly, controls more than one half of the voting power; or has the power to govern the\nfinancial and operating policies, to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors, or to cast a majority of votes at a meeting of\ndirectors.\nUse of estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements include the useful lives of property and equipment, allowance for credit losses, inventory reserve, accrued\ndefective return, provision for contingent liabilities, revenue recognition, deferred taxes and uncertain tax position. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nForeign currency translation and transaction\nThe functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries are the local currency of the country in which the subsidiaries operate, except for FGI\nInternational, which is incorporated in Hong Kong and adopted the United States Dollar (“U.S. Dollar” or “USD”) as its functional currency. The reporting\ncurrency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the applicable\nrates of exchange in effect at that date. The equity denominated in the functional currencies is translated at the historical rates of exchange at the time of capital\ncontributions. The results of operations and the cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the average rates of exchange during the\nreporting period. Because cash flows are translated based on the average translation rates, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a separate\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income included in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity.\nTransaction gains and losses arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency in the\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\nFor the purpose of presenting the financial statements of subsidiaries using the Renminbi (“RMB”) as their functional currency, the Company’s assets and\nliabilities are expressed in U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, which was 6.9939 and 7.1006 as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively; shareholders’ equity accounts are translated at historical rates, and income and expense items are translated at the average\nexchange rate during the period, which was 7.2080 and 7.2414 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 7.2111 and 7.0384\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the purpose of presenting the financial statements of the subsidiary using the Canadian Dollar (“CAD”) as its functional currency, the Company’s\nassets and liabilities are expressed in U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, which was 1.3700 and 1.3246 as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively; shareholders’ equity accounts are translated at historical rates, and income and expense items are translated at the average\nexchange rate during the period, which was 1.3700 and 1.3541 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.3448 and 1.3541\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFor the purpose of presenting the financial statements of the subsidiary using the Euro (“EUR”) as its functional currency, the Company’s assets and\nliabilities are expressed in U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, which was 0.8956 and 0.9059 as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively; shareholders’ equity accounts are translated at historical rates, and income and expense items are translated at the average\nexchange rate during the period, which was 0.9207 and 0.9143 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 0.9220 and 0.9227\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n14\nTable of Contents\nReclassification\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation, specifically the depreciation and amortization in the\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. These reclassifications have no effect on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and the\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss previously reported.\nCash\nCash consists of cash on hand and demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions that have original maturities of three months or less.\nThe Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAccounts receivable, net\nBills and trade receivables include trade accounts due from customers. In establishing the required allowance for expected credit losses, management\nconsiders historical collection experience, aging of the receivables, the economic environment, industry trend analysis, and the credit history and financial\nconditions of the customers. Management reviews its receivables on a regular basis to determine if the expected credit losses are adequate and adjusts the\nallowance when necessary. Delinquent account balances are written off against allowance for credit losses after management has determined that the likelihood\nof collection is not probable.\nInventories, net\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost consists of purchase price and related shipping and handling expenses, and is\ndetermined using the weighted average cost method, based on individual products. The methods of determining inventory costs are used consistently from year\nto year. A provision for slow-moving items is calculated based on historical experience. Management reviews this provision annually to assess whether, based\non economic conditions, it is adequate.\nPrepayments\nPrepayments are cash deposited or advanced to suppliers for the purchase of goods or services that have not been received or provided. This amount is\nrefundable and bears no interest. Prepayments and deposits are classified as either current or non-current based on the terms of the respective agreements.\nThese advances are unsecured and are reviewed periodically to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired.\nProperty and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the\nassets using the straight-line method from the time the assets are placed in service. Estimated useful lives are as follows:\nUseful Life\nBuilding 20 years\nLeasehold Improvements Lesser of lease term and expected\nuseful life\nMachinery and equipment 3 – 5 years\nFurniture and fixtures 3 – 5 years\nVehicles 5 years\nMolds 3 – 5 years\nIntangible assets, net\nThe Company’s intangible assets with definite useful lives primarily consist of software acquired for internal use. The Company amortizes its intangible\nassets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets\n15\nTable of Contents\nfor impairment. The Company typically amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of ten\nyears.\nImpairment for long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever material events\nor changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying\nvalue of an asset group may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of an asset group based on the undiscounted future cash flows the\nasset group is expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the\nasset group plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset group, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset group. If an impairment is\nidentified, the Company would reduce the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when\navailable and appropriate, to comparable market values. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no impairment of long-lived assets was recognized.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, net (“ROU assets”),\noperating lease liabilities — current and operating lease liabilities — noncurrent on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the duration of the lease term while lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to\nmake lease payments in exchange for the right to use an underlying asset. ROU assets and lease liabilities are measured based on the present value of fixed\nlease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to the commencement date and\ninitial direct costs incurred, and is reduced by any lease incentives received. The Company reviews its ROU assets as material events occur or circumstances\nchange that would indicate the carrying amount of the ROU assets are not recoverable and exceed their fair values. If the carrying amount of an ROU asset is\nnot recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, then the Company would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and\nthe current fair value.\nAs most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate on the commencement date of\nthe lease as the discount rate in determining the present value of future lease payments. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate for each lease\nby using the incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at\ncommencement date. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when there are relevant economic incentives present that\nmake it reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company accounts for any non- lease components separately from lease\ncomponents.\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe accounting standard regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and requires\ndisclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company.\nThe accounting standards define fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure\nrequirements for fair value measures. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n• Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n• Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for\nthe assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\n• Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\n16\nTable of Contents\nFinancial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are reported in the consolidated balance sheets at face value or cost, which\napproximate fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market\nrates of interest.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognized revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or performance obligations for services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the goods or services.\nThe Company generates revenue from sales of kitchen and bath products, and recognizes revenue as control of its products is transferred to its customers,\nwhich is generally at the time of shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual terms with the Company’s customers. The Company’s customers’ payment\nterms generally range from 15 to 60 days of fulfilling its performance obligations and recognizing revenue.\nThe Company provides customer programs and incentive offerings, including co-operative marketing arrangements and volume-based incentives. These\ncustomer programs and incentives are considered variable consideration. The Company includes in revenue variable consideration only to the extent that it is\nprobable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the variable consideration is resolved. This\ndetermination is made based upon known customer program and incentive offerings at the time of sale, and expected sales volume forecasts as it relates to the\nCompany’s volume- based incentives. This determination is updated on a monthly basis.\nCertain product sales include a right of return. The Company estimates future product returns at the time of sale based on historical experience and records\na corresponding reduction in accounts receivable.\nThe Company records receivables related to revenue when it has an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment.\nThe Company’s disaggregated revenue is summarized as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD USD USD USD\nRevenue by product line\nSanitaryware $ 21,451,387 $ 20,740,380 $ 59,303,663 $ 54,949,082\nBath Furniture 4,162,291 2,531,430 11,282,623 12,304,688\nShower System 7,143,283 4,931,437 18,793,999 14,248,679\nOthers 3,342,218 1,729,365 6,843,362 4,782,342\nTotal $ 36,099,179 $ 29,932,612 $ 96,223,647 $ 86,284,791\nTotal Revenue Total Assets\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended As of As of\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, December 31,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD USD USD USD USD USD\nRevenue/ total assets by\ngeographic location\nUnited States $ 22,195,976 $ 18,356,278 $ 59,833,465 $ 54,921,572 $ 48,881,570 $ 38,401,665\nCanada 9,916,907 9,081,571 26,391,317 23,120,014 15,049,656 17,850,709\nEurope 3,418,826 2,460,762 9,273,872 8,209,204 1,176,616 528,068\nRest of World 567,470 34,001 724,993 34,001 9,557,084 8,964,488\nTotal $ 36,099,179 $ 29,932,612 $ 96,223,647 $ 86,284,791 $ 74,664,926 $ 65,744,930\n17\nTable of Contents\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling and distribution expenses on the accompanying statement of operations.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, shipping and handling expense was $288,657 and $176,077, respectively. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, shipping and handling expense was $804,388 and $490,161, respectively.\nShare-based compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). In accordance\nwith ASC 718, the Company determines whether an award should be classified and accounted for as a liability award or an equity award. All the Company’s\nshare-based awards were classified as equity awards and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values.\nThe Company has elected to recognize share-based compensation using the straight-line method for all share-based awards granted over the requisite\nservice period, which is the vesting period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur in accordance with ASC 718. The Company, with the\nassistance of an independent third-party valuation firm, determines the fair value of the stock options granted to employees. The Black Scholes Model is\napplied in determining the estimated fair value of the options granted to employees and non-employees. The Company recognized share-based compensation of\n$208,506 and $59,337 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $536,597 and $331,893 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred taxes are recognized based on the future tax consequences of the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases. The future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Possible sources of\ntaxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability,\ntax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income.\nIf, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not (i.e., more than 50 percent likely) that such deferred tax assets\nwill not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company’s\nthree- year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable, and the accounting guidance\nrestricts the amount of reliance we can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets.\nThe current accounting guidance allows the recognition of only those income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained\nupon examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that there is an increased potential for volatility in its effective tax rate because this\nthreshold allows for changes in the income tax environment and, to a greater extent, the inherent complexities of income tax law in a substantial number of\njurisdictions, which may affect the computation of its liability for uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company records interest and penalties on our uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the tax years ended December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2022 for FGI Industries remain open for statutory examination\nby tax authority.\nWe record the tax effects of Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) related to our foreign operations\nas a component of income tax expense in the period in which the tax arises.\nNon-controlling interests\nThe Company’s non-controlling interests represent the minority shareholders’ ownership interests related to the Company’s subsidiary, including 40% in\nIsla Porter LLC. The non-controlling interests are presented in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets, separate from equity attributable to the shareholders\nof the Company. Non-controlling interests in the results of operations of the Company are presented on the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of\nincome and comprehensive income (loss) as allocations of the net income or loss for the period between non-controlling shareholders and the shareholders of\nthe Company.\n18\nTable of Contents\nComprehensive income (loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of two components: net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income (loss) refers to\nrevenue, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. GAAP are recorded as an element of equity but are excluded from net income. Other comprehensive\nincome consists of a foreign currency translation adjustment resulting from the Company not using the U.S. Dollar as its functional currencies.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” (“ASC 260”). ASC 260 requires companies\nto present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income divided by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Diluted\nEPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of the potential ordinary shares (e.g., convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they had been\nconverted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential ordinary shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase\nincome per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD USD USD USD\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) income attributable to FGI Industries Ltd. shareholders $ (550,137) $ 409,535 $ (798,761) $ 194,641\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding — basic 9,563,914 9,500,000 9,565,587 9,500,000\nPotentially dilutive shares from outstanding options/warrants — 286,522 — 322,847\nWeighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding — diluted 9,563,914 9,786,522 9,565,587 9,822,847\nEarnings (loss) per share — basic $ (0.06) $ 0.04 $ (0.08) $ 0.02\nEarnings (loss) per share — diluted $ (0.06) $ 0.04 $ (0.08) $ 0.02\nSegment reporting\nASC 280, “Segment Reporting,” establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments on a basis consistent with the Company’s\ninternal organizational structure as well as information about geographical areas, business segments and major customers in financial statements for detailing\nthe Company’s business segments.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures,” which requires additional disclosures regarding an entity’s reportable segments, particularly regarding significant segment\nexpenses, as well as information relating to the chief operating decision maker.

The Company is\nauthorized to issue 50,000,000 ordinary shares with a par value of $0.001 per share.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Company completed the Reorganization upon the consummation of the initial public offering (“IPO”). After the Reorganization\nand the IPO, the Company’s authorized share capital is $21,000 divided into (i) 200,000,000 Ordinary Shares of par value of $0.0001 each, and (ii) 10,000,000\nPreference Shares of par value of $0.0001 each; 9,500,000 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding accordingly. The Company believes it is appropriate to\nreflect\n23\nTable of Contents\nthese share issuances as nominal share issuances on a retroactive basis similar to a stock split pursuant to ASC 260. The Company has retroactively adjusted all\nshares and per share data for all the periods presented.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn January 27, 2022, the Company consummated its IPO of 2,500,000 units (“Units”), each consisting of (i) one ordinary share, $0.0001 par value per\nshare, of the Company (the “Shares”), and (ii) one warrant of the Company (the “Warrants”) entitling the holder to purchase one Share at an exercise price of\n$6.00 per Share. The Shares and Warrants were issued separately in the offering, and may be transferred separately immediately upon issuance. The Units were\nsold at a price of $6.00 per Unit. The Warrants included in the units were immediately exercisable following the consummation of the offering, have an\nexercise price equal to the initial public offering price, and expire five years from the date of issuance.\nFor the purposes of covering any over-allotments in connection with the distribution and sale of the Units, the Company granted a 45-day option to the\nunderwriters to purchase (the “Over-allotment Option”), in the aggregate, up to 375,000 ordinary shares (the “Option Shares”) and Warrants to purchase up to\n375,000 ordinary shares (the “Option Warrants”), which was exercisable in any combination of Option Shares and/or Option Warrants at the per Share purchase\nprice and/or the per Warrant purchase price, respectively. On January 25, 2022, the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase up to an additional\n375,000 Warrants at the price of $0.01 per Option Warrant. Management determined that these Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815-40;\nhowever, they fall under the scope exception, which states that contracts issued that both a) indexed to its own stock; and b) classified in shareholders' equity\nare not considered derivatives. The Warrants were recorded at their fair value on the date of grant as a component of equity.\nThe aggregated fair value of these Warrants on January 27, 2022 was $4.16 million. The fair value has been estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing\nmodel with the following weighted-average assumptions: market value of underlying stock of $1.448; risk free rate of 1.66%; expected term of five years;\nexercise price of the warrants of $6.00; volatility of 44.00%; and expected future dividends of $0. As of the date of this report, 2,875,000 warrants were issued\nand outstanding; and none of the warrants has been exercised.\nThe gross proceeds from the IPO were approximately $15.0 million with net proceeds of approximately $12.4 million, after deducting estimated\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. Immediately following the consummation of the IPO, there\nwere an aggregate of 9,500,000 ordinary shares issued and outstanding. As a result of the IPO, the ordinary shares and Warrants now trade on the Nasdaq\nCapital Market under the symbol “FGI” and “FGIWW”, respectively.\nPublic Offering Warrants\nIn connection with and upon the closing of the IPO on January 27, 2022, the Company issued warrants equal to 2% of the Shares issued in the IPO, or\n50,000 ordinary shares, to the representative of the underwriters for the IPO. The warrants carry a term of five years, shall not be exercisable for a period of\n180 days from the closing of the IPO and shall be exercisable at a price equal to the IPO price per share. Management determined that these warrants meet the\ndefinition of a derivative under ASC 815-40; however, they fall under the scope exception, which states that contracts issued that are both a) indexed to its own\nstock; and b) classified in shareholders' equity are not considered derivatives. The warrants were recorded at their fair value on the date of grant as a component\nof equity.\nThe aggregated fair value of these IPO warrants on January 27, 2022 was $0.1 million. The fair value has been estimated using the Black-Scholes pricing\nmodel with the following weighted-average assumptions: market value of underlying stock of $1.448; risk free rate of 1.66%; expected term of five years;\nexercise price of the warrants of $6.00; volatility of 44.00%; and expected future dividends of $0. As of the date of this report, warrants exercisable for 50,000\nshares were issued and outstanding; and none of the warrants have been exercised.\nNote 10 — Stock-based compensation\n2021 Equity Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn October 7, 2021, the board of directors adopted the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Equity Plan”). The 2021 Equity Plan permits the grant of\nequity and equity-based incentive awards, including non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards,\nstock unit awards and other stock-based awards. The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to attract and retain the best available personnel for positions of\nresponsibility within the\n24\nTable of Contents\nCompany, to provide additional incentives to them to align their interests with those of the Company’s shareholders and to thereby promote the Company’s\nlong-term business success.\nOn October 7, 2021, the board approved the adoption of the FGI Industries Ltd. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). The ESPP was approved by\nthe Company’s shareholders on October 7, 2021, and became effective on the effective date of the Company’s consummation of the IPO of its ordinary shares.\nThe ESPP offers eligible employees the opportunity to acquire a stock ownership interest in the Company through periodic payroll deductions that will be\napplied towards the purchase of ordinary shares at a discount from the then-current market price.\nThe board set the maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares reserved and available pursuant to the 2021 Equity Plan at 1,500,000 shares. The number\nof ordinary shares reserved for issuance under our 2021 Equity Plan will automatically increase on the first day of each year, commencing on January 1, 2022\nand ending on (and including) January 1, 2031, in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) 4.5% of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding on December 31\nof the immediately preceding calendar year, (b) 600,000 ordinary shares, or (c) such lesser number of shares as determined by the Board. The Equity Plan\nbecame effective on September 28, 2021.\nThe Company believes the options or awards granted contain an explicit service condition and/or performance condition. Under ASC 718-10-55-76, if the\nvesting (or exercisability) of an award is based on the satisfaction of both a service and performance condition, the entity must initially determine which\noutcomes are probable and recognize the compensation cost over the longer of the explicit or implicit service period. Because an initial public offering\ngenerally is not considered to be probable until the initial public offering is effective, no compensation cost was recognized until the IPO occurred.\nRestricted shares units (“RSU”)\nIn January 2022, the Company issued 183,750 restricted share units (“RSUs”) to certain officers and employees under the 2021 Equity Plan as\ncompensation awards.

The assumptions used to value the\noptions granted to employees were as follows:\nApril 2024 March 2024 March 2023\nRisk-free interest rate (%) 4.54 4.21 3.65\nExpected volatility range (%) 55.32 55.11 63.36\nFair market value per ordinary share as at grant dates $ 1.32 $ 1.50 $ 2.08\nThe risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a\nterm consistent with the contractual term of the awards. Expected volatility is estimated based on the volatility of ordinary shares or common stock of several\ncomparable companies in the same industry. The expected exercise multiple is based on management’s estimation, which the Company believes is\nrepresentative of the future.\nThe Company has elected to recognize share-based compensation expense using a straight-line method for all the employee equity awards granted with\ngraded vesting based on service conditions, provided that the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant\ndate fair value of the equity awards that are vested at that date.\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the amount of share-based compensation expense included in each of the relevant financial statement line items:\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nUSD USD\nSelling and distribution expenses $ 116,584 $ 93,746\nGeneral and administrative expenses 420,013 238,147\nTotal share-based compensation expenses $ 536,597 $ 331,893\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $1,280,193 in total unrecognized employee share-based compensation expense related to unvested options and RSUs,\nwhich may be adjusted for actual forfeitures occurring in the future.

The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new\nU.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly\ntraded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from\nwhich shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase.\nHowever, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against\nthe fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the\nTreasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.\nThere was no material impact of the IR Act on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nNote 12 — Related party transactions and balances\nSales to a related party\nFor the Three Months Ended September For the Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\nNature of\nName of Related Party Relationship Transactions 2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD USD USD USD\nAn entity under\nForemost Worldwide Co., Ltd. common control Sales $ 408,977 $ — $ 408,977 $ —\n$ 408,977 $ — $ 408,977 $ —\nPurchases from related parties\nFor the Three Months Ended September\n30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\nNature of\nName of Related Party Relationship Transactions 2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD USD USD USD\nAn entity under\nFocal Capital Holding Limited common control Purchase $ 1,903,797 $ 980,910 $ 4,658,602 $ 5,950,640\nAn entity under\nForemost Worldwide Co., Ltd. common control Purchase 1,883,192 717,188 5,837,250 1,755,577\nRizhao Foremost Woodwork An entity under\nManufacturing Co., Ltd. common control Purchase 15,874 — 39,943 —\nF.P.Z.

Some\nof the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect\nto our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many\nfactors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and of our 2023 Form 10-K, our actual results\ncould differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. All\namounts in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are approximate.\nOverview\nFGI is a global supplier of kitchen and bath products. Over the course of 30 years, we have built an industry-wide reputation for product innovation,\nquality, and excellent customer service. We are currently focused on the following product categories: sanitaryware (primarily toilets, sinks, pedestals and toilet\nseats), bath furniture (vanities, mirrors and cabinets), shower systems, customer kitchen cabinetry and other accessory items. These products are sold primarily\nfor R&R activity and, to a lesser extent, new home or commercial construction. We sell our products through numerous partners, including mass retail centers,\nwholesale and commercial distributors, online retailers and specialty stores.\nConsistent with our long-term strategic plan, we intend to drive value creation for our shareholders through a balanced focus on product innovation,\norganic growth, and efficient capital deployment. The following initiatives represent key strategic priorities for us:\n• Commitment to product innovation. We have a history of being an innovator in the kitchen and bath markets and developing “on-trend” products\nand bringing them to market ahead of the competition. We have developed deep marketing skills, leading design capabilities, and product\ndevelopment expertise. A recent example of our innovative product development includes the Jetcoat shower wall systems, which offer a stylized\ndesign option without the fuss of messy grout. We expect to continue to invest in research and development to drive product innovation in 2024.\n• “BPC” (Brands, Products, Channels) strategy to drive above-market organic growth. We have continued to invest in our BPC strategy despite\nthe market challenges, which is expected to drive improved organic growth in the longer term. We recently announced that we entered into a 5-year\nlicensing agreement that will provide us access to an industry leading overflow toilet technology. We will continue to market this technology as\nFlushGuard Overflow Technology. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we were awarded product placements at several large customers, including two\nof the largest commercial distributors in North America. In addition, we continue to focus on our initiatives to expand geographically, with recently\nsigned agreements providing entry into India, Eastern Europe and the UK.\n• Enhanced margin performance. We generated gross margin of 27.7% in the first nine months of 2024, up from 26.7% in the same period last year,\nowing to the ongoing shift to higher margin products. During the remainder of 2024, we expect gross margins to remain consistent with those\ngenerated during fiscal year 2023.\n• Efficient capital deployment. We will continue to prioritize capital deployment in support of organic growth opportunities, while continuing to\nevaluate strategic M&A opportunities. With total liquidity of $16.3 million as of September 30, 2024, the Company believes it has sufficient financial\nflexibility to fund its organic growth strategy.\n• Deep manufacturing partners and customer relationships. We have developed strong manufacturing and sourcing partners over the last 30+ years,\nwhich we believe will continue to give us a competitive advantage in the markets we serve. We also have deep relationships with an established global\ncustomer base, offering end-to-end solutions to support category growth. While recent supply chain and inflation pressures have been a headwind, our\ndurable partnerships with manufacturing and sourcing partners have helped to mitigate these challenges.\nWe were incorporated in the Cayman Islands on May 26, 2021 in connection with a reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of our parent company,\nForemost Groups Ltd.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenue increased by $9.9 million, or 11.5%, to $96.2 million from $86.3\nmillion for the same period last year. The increase in our revenue was primarily driven by increases in sales of shower system, bath furniture and custom\nkitchen cabinetry.\nRevenue categories by product are summarized as follow:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 Percentage 2023 Percentage Percentage\nUSD % USD % %\nSanitaryware $ 21,451,387 59.4 $ 20,740,380 69.3 3.4\nBath Furniture 4,162,291 11.5 2,531,430 8.5 64.4\nShower System 7,143,283 19.8 4,931,437 16.5 44.9\nOthers 3,342,218 9.3 1,729,365 5.7 93.3\nTotal $ 36,099,179 100.0 $ 29,932,612 100.0 20.6\n37\nTable of Contents\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 Percentage 2023 Percentage Percentage\nUSD % USD % %\nSanitaryware $ 59,303,663 61.6 $ 54,949,082 63.7 7.9\nBath Furniture 11,282,623 11.7 12,304,688 14.3 (8.3)\nShower System 18,793,999 19.5 14,248,679 16.5 31.9\nOthers 6,843,362 7.2 4,782,342 5.5 43.1\nTotal $ 96,223,647 100.0 $ 86,284,791 100.0 11.5\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from sales of sanitaryware, which accounted for 59.4% and 61.6% of our total revenue for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to 69.3% and 63.7% for the comparable periods of 2023. Revenue generated from the sales of sanitaryware\nincreased by 3.4% to $21.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $20.7 million for same period of 2023. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, this revenue increased by 7.9% to $59.3 million from $54.9 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in revenue was due, in part,\nby a reversal of delayed shipments in the prior quarter stemming from our transition to a new enterprise software system and ocean freight disruptions.\nOur revenue from bath furniture sales accounted for 11.5% and 11.7% of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 8.5% and 14.3% for the comparable periods of 2023. Bath Furniture sales increased by 64.4% to $4.2 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $2.5 million for the same period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue from Bath Furniture sales\ndecreased by 8.3% to $11.3 million from $12.3 million for the same period of 2023. Our recently launched mid-tier products to better address the current\ndemand environment of trading down to lower priced offering is gaining traction.\nRevenue from sales of Shower Systems made up approximately 19.8% and 19.5% of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to 16.5% and 16.5% for the comparable periods of 2023. Revenue from sales of shower systems increased by 44.9% to $7.1 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $4.9 million for the comparable period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenue\nfrom sales of shower systems increased by 31.9% to $18.8 million from $14.2 million for the same period of 2023. Our recently launched programs continue to\nhave a positive impact during the third quarter.\nOur revenue from sales of other products (custom kitchen cabinetry and other small offerings) increased by 93.3% to $3.3 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.7 million for the same period of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other revenue increased by\n43.1% to $6.8 million from $4.8 million for the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by volume growth resulting from continued strength in\nsales of the Covered Bridge custom-kitchen cabinetry businesses.\nRevenue Categories by Geographic Location\nWe derive our revenue primarily from the United States, Canada and Europe. Revenue categories by geographic location are summarized as follows:\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 Percentage 2023 Percentage Percentage\nUSD % USD % %\nUnited States $ 22,195,976 61.5 $ 18,356,278 61.3 20.9\nCanada 9,916,907 27.5 9,081,571 30.3 9.2\nEurope 3,418,826 9.5 2,460,762 8.2 38.9\nRest of World 567,470 1.5 34,001 0.2 1569.0\nTotal $ 36,099,179 100.0 $ 29,932,612 100.0 20.6\n38\nTable of Contents\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, Change\n2024 Percentage 2023 Percentage Percentage\nUSD % USD % %\nUnited States $ 59,833,465 62.2 $ 54,921,572 63.7 8.9\nCanada 26,391,317 27.4 23,120,014 26.8 14.1\nEurope 9,273,872 9.6 8,209,204 9.5 13.0\nRest of World 724,993 0.8 34,001 — 2032.3\nTotal $ 96,223,647 100.0 $ 86,284,791 100.0 11.5\nWe generated the majority of our revenue in the United States market, which amounted to $22.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $18.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 20.9% increase for the three-month periods. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, however, revenue from United States market increased by 8.9% to $59.8 million, compared to $54.9 million for the same period of\n2023. Such revenue accounted for 61.5% and 62.2% of our total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\n61.3% and 63.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue was due, in part, by a reversal of delayed\nshipments in the prior quarter stemming from our transition to a new enterprise software system and ocean freight disruptions.\nOur second largest market is Canada. Our revenue generated in the Canadian market was $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 9.2% increase. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrevenue from Canadian market increased by 14.1% to $26.4 million, compared to $23.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increased sales in the Canada\nmarket were primarily driven by stabilized demand from wholesale customers.\nWe also derive revenue from Europe, which consists primarily of sales in Germany. This amounted to $3.4 million and $9.3 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.5 million and $8.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a 38.9%\nand 13.0% increase for the three-month and nine-month periods, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $9.3 million and $26.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 18.9% and 15.8% compared to the\nsame periods of 2023. Gross profit margin was 25.8% and 27.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, down 40 and up 100 basis points\nfrom 26.2% and 26.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and distribution expenses primarily consisted of personnel costs, marketing and promotion costs, commission, and freight and leasing charges. Our\nselling and distribution expenses increased by $1.7 million, or 37.4%, to $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $4.6 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023, and increased by $4.6 million, or 32.6%, to $18.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $14.1\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was largely attributable to increased personnel costs,\nmarketing and promotion expenses and warehouse expenses as a result of inflation and our initiatives to drive sales growth.\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consisted of personnel costs, professional service fees, depreciation, travel, and office supply expenses. Our\ngeneral and administrative expenses increased by $0.3 million, or 12.2%, to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $2.4 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased by $0.8 million, or 11.8%, to $7.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $6.7\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to inflation and expenses incurred in connection with newly\nformed subsidiaries.\nResearch and development expenses mainly consisted of personnel costs and product development costs. Our research and development activities\nremained stable and are relatively immaterial to our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expenses)\nOther income (expenses) represents interest income and expenses, as well as non-recurring non-operating gains and losses. Other expenses, net decreased\nas a result of proceeds received from a settlement agreement and gains from foreign currency transactions.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded provision for income taxes of $0.3 million and benefit of income taxes of approximately $9,000 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, and provision for income taxes of $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The fluctuation\nin effective tax rate was primarily driven by foreign operations with various tax rates and non-deductible items.\nNet (Loss) Income\nWe incurred net loss of $0.7 million and net income of $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net loss of\n$1.3 million and net income of $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These changes had resulted from the\ncombination of the changes discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities and cash borrowed under credit facilities, which we believe provides\nsufficient liquidity to support our financing needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and working capital of $3.0 million and $12.7 million, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we drew an aggregate of approximately $5.5 million on the Credit Agreement, the Canadian Revolver and\nthe CTBC Credit Line for working capital replenishment.\nWe believe our revenue and operations will continue to grow and the current working capital is sufficient to support our operations and debt obligations\nwell into the foreseeable future. However, we may need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changes in business conditions or other\ndevelopments, such as rising interest rates, inflation and increased costs, and may also need additional cash resources in the future if we wish to pursue\nopportunities for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation or other similar actions. For example, from time to time we may provide loans or other\noperational support to Foremost to assist Foremost in capital expenditures or other efforts related to the manufacturing services that Foremost provides to us,\nwhich could limit the assets available for other corporate purposes or require additional resources. If it is determined that the cash requirements exceed our\namount of cash on hand, we may seek to issue debt or equity securities, and there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available on acceptable\nterm, if at all.\nAs of September 30, 2024, FGI’s total outstanding debt consisted of the Credit Agreement with East West Bank and the CTBC Credit Line with CTBC\nBank (each discussed below).\nEast West Bank Credit Facility\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, FGI Industries, has a line of credit with East West Bank pursuant to a Business Loan Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”)\nwith East West Bank, which is collateralized by all of the assets of FGI Industries and personally guaranteed by Liang Chou Chen, who holds approximately\n49.89% of the voting control of Foremost. On November 25, 2022, the Credit Agreement was amended and restated with a maximum borrowing amount of\n$18,000,000 and a maturity date of December 21, 2024.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement, FGI Industries is required to maintain (a) a debt coverage ratio (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization divided by current portion of long-term debt plus interest expense) of not less than 1.25 to 1, tested at the end of each fiscal quarter; (b) an\neffective tangible net worth (defined as total book net worth plus minority interest, less amounts due from officers, shareholders and affiliates, minus intangible\nassets and accumulated amortization, plus debt subordinated to East West Bank) of not less than $10,000,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and\nthereafter, on a consolidated basis; and (c) a total debt to tangible net worth ratio (defined as total liabilities divided by tangible net worth, which is defined as\ntotal book net worth plus minority interest, less loans to officers, shareholders, and affiliates minus intangible assets and accumulated amortization) not to\nexceed 4.0 to 1, tested at the end of each fiscal quarter, on a consolidated basis. As of September 30, 2024, FGI Industries was in compliance with this financial\ncovenant. As described in Item 1. Note 8, FGI Industries is also required to provide the lender with certain\n40\nTable of Contents\nperiodic financial information, including annual audited financial statements of FGI Industries on a non-consolidated basis. As of the date of this report, FGI\nIndustries has obtained a waiver for such Corporate Borrower’s Audited Annual Statements, a U.S. standalone reporting obligation under the Credit Agreement,\nwhich were due by April 30, 2024.\nThe loan bears interest rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (i) 0.25 percentage points less than the Prime Rate quoted by the Wall Street Journal\nor (ii) the SOFR Rate (as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited and displayed by Bloomberg LP) plus 2.20% per annum (in either\ncase, subject to a minimum rate of 4.500% per annum). The interest rate as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 7.75% and 8.25%, respectively.\nEach sum of borrowings under the Credit Agreement is deemed due on demand and is classified as a short-term loan. The outstanding balance of such loan\nwas $9,161,641 and $6,959,175 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nHSBC Canada Bank Loan\nFGI Canada Ltd. has a line of credit agreement with HSBC Canada (the “Canadian Revolver”). The revolving line of credit with HSBC Canada allows for\nborrowing up to CAD7,500,000 (USD5,474,453 as of September 30, 2024). This is an assets-based line of credit, the borrowing limit is calculated based on\ncertain percentage of accounts receivable and inventory balances. Pursuant to the Canadian Revolver, FGI Canada Ltd. is required to maintain (a) a debt to\ntangible net worth ratio of no more than 3.00 to 1.00; and (b) a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.25 to 1.00. The loan bears interest at a\nrate of Prime rate plus 0.50%. As of September 30, 2024, FGI Canada Ltd. was not in compliance with certain financial covenants in the Canadian Revolver\nrelated to its debt to tangible net worth ratio. As of the date of this quarterly report, FGI Canada Ltd. has requested a waiver from the lender, which is being\nprocessed by the lender. In the absence of an executed waiver, the Company has classified the outstanding balance of the loan as a current liability on the\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company has sufficient liquidity to repay the loan in full if immediate\nsettlement were required.\nBorrowings under this line of credit amounted to $1,026,392 and $0 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The facility matures\nat the discretion of HSBC Canada upon 60 days’ notice.\nFGI Canada Ltd. also has a revolving foreign exchange facility up to a permitted maximum of USD3,000,000. The advances are available to purchase\nforeign exchange forward contracts from time to time up to six months, subject to an overall maximum aggregate USD Equivalent outstanding face value not\nexceeding the Foreign Exchange Facility Limit.\nCTBC Credit Facility\nOn January 25, 2024, FGI International entered into an omnibus credit line (the “CTBC Credit Line”) with CTBC Bank Co., Ltd. (“CTBC”). Under the\nCTBC Credit Line, FGI International may borrow, from time to time, up to $2.3 million, with borrowings limited to 90% of FGI International’s export “open\naccount” trade receivables. The CTBC Credit Line will bear interest at a rate of “Base Rate”, which is based on monthly or quarterly Taipei Interbank Offered\nin effect from time to time, plus 120 base points and handling fees, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The CTBC Credit Line is unsecured and is fully\nguaranteed by the Company and partially guaranteed by Liang Chou Chen. Borrowings under this line of credit amounted to $2,297,464 and $0 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the key components of our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nUSD USD\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (8,042,745) $ (1,986,964)\nNet cash used in investing activities (2,044,264) (883,054)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 5,526,322 (1,832,849)\nEffect of exchange rate fluctuation on cash (171,892) 5,386\nNet changes in cash (4,732,579) (4,697,481)\nCash, beginning of period 7,777,241 10,067,428\nCash, end of period $ 3,044,662 $ 5,369,947\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was approximately $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was primarily attributable to an\nincrease in prepayments and other receivables - related parties of approximately $6.0 million, an increase in inventories of approximately $3.9 million, an\nincrease in accounts receivable of approximately $3.8 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of approximately $1.4 million, net loss of $1.3 million, a\ndecrease in accounts payable - related parties of approximately $0.7 million, and an increase in other noncurrent assets of approximately $0.6 million.

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and, in some\ninstances, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nChanges in estimates are recorded in results of operations in the period that the events or circumstances giving rise to such changes occur. Within the context of\nthese critical accounting estimates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different policies or\nestimates being reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, “Summary of significant accounting policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following non-GAAP measures to evaluate\nour business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. Our non-GAAP measures are:\nAdjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Operating Margins and Adjusted Net Income. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP. They are supplemental financial measures of our performance only, and should not be considered substitutes for net income, income from\noperations or any other measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other entities.\nWe define Adjusted Income from Operations as GAAP income from operations excluding the impact of certain non-recurring expenses, including IPO-\nrelated compensation (cash and stock-based), legal fees and business expansion expenses. We define Adjusted Net Income as GAAP income before income\ntaxes excluding the impact of certain non-recurring expenses and income, such as IPO-related compensation, legal fees and business expansion expenses,\nincome taxes at historical average effective rate, as well as net income attributable to non-controlling shareholders. We define Adjusted Operating Margins as\nadjusted income from operations divided by revenue.\nWe use these non-GAAP measures, along with GAAP measures, to evaluate our business, measure our financial performance and profitability and our\nability to manage expenses, after adjusting for certain one-time expenses, identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions. We\nbelieve these non-GAAP measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, and not in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our\nresults of operations under GAAP, are useful to investors as they are widely used measures of performance and the adjustments we make to these non-GAAP\nmeasures provide investors further insight into our profitability and additional perspectives in comparing our performance over time on a consistent basis.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles Income from Operations to Adjusted Income from Operations and Adjusted Operating Margins, as well as Net income to\nAdjusted Net Income for the periods presented.\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD USD USD USD\n(Loss) income from operations $ (65,826) $ 481,690 $ (837,122) $ 1,059,038\nAdjustments:\nNon-recurring IPO-related stock-based compensation 59,719 59,719 179,157 179,156\nIPO and arbitration legal fee — — — 50,000\nBusiness expansion expense 61,770 61,770 185,310 185,312\nAdjusted (loss) income from operations $ 55,663 $ 603,179 $ (472,655) $ 1,473,506\nRevenue $ 36,099,179 $ 29,932,612 $ 96,223,647 $ 86,284,791\nAdjusted operating margins (%) 0.2 2.0 (0.5) 1.7\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUSD USD USD USD\n(Loss) income before income taxes $ (430,711) $ 516,008 $ (1,268,111) $ 525,189\nAdjustments:\nNon-recurring IPO-related stock-based compensation 59,719 59,719 179,157 179,156\nIPO and arbitration legal fee — — — 50,000\nBusiness expansion expense 61,770 61,770 185,310 185,312\nAdjusted (loss) income before income taxes (309,222) 637,497 (903,644) 939,657\nLess: income taxes at 18% rate (55,660) 114,749 (162,656) 169,138\nLess: net loss attributable to non-controlling shareholders (148,111) (66,043) (460,761) (66,043)\nAdjusted net (loss) income $ (105,451) $ 588,791 $ (280,227) $ 836,562\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”), means our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file\nor submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the\nreports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal\nfinancial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the\ncost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief\n44\nTable of Contents\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\nEvaluation of the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and\noperation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nIdentified Material Weakness\nManagement noted that there is an inadequate segregation of duties related to certain accounting functions due to the size of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the Company lacks evidence of management review controls activity taking place, such as but not limited to, the review and approval of journal\nentries and account reconciliations.\nAccordingly, the Company concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company’s internal controls.\nManagement’s Remediation Initiatives\nAs of September 30, 2024, and through the date of this filing we are in the process of implementing segregation of duties and are determining further\ninitiatives to undertake in order to remediate this remaining material weakness and anticipate that these initiatives will be implemented by the end of fiscal year\n2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOther than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II- OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the results of any such disputes, and despite the\npotential outcomes, the existence thereof may have an adverse material impact on us due to diversion of management time and attention as well as the financial\ncosts related to resolving such disputes.\nAyers Bath Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, FGI Industries (formerly known as Foremost Groups, Inc.), our wholly-owned subsidiary, was involved in litigation arising from\nits efforts to protect an exclusivity agreement with sanitaryware manufacturer Tangshan Huida Ceramic Group Co., Ltd. (“Huida”) through the second quarter\nof 2024. In June 2024, the parties entered into a settlement agreement with a mutual release of all claims related to the litigation. The settlement amount is\nreflected in other income (expenses), net.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, includes a detailed discussion of our risk factors. At the time of this filing,\nexcept as provided below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors that were included in the Form 10-K.\nIf we fail to meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements, it could result in a delisting of our ordinary shares.\nIf we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price\nrequirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, if the bid price of our common stock were to close\nbelow the required minimum $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we may receive a deficiency notice from Nasdaq regarding our failure to\ncomply with Nasdaq\n45\nTable of Contents\nMarketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). If we receive such a notice, pursuant to Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we may become subject to a period of 180 calendar\ndays to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2). If at any time the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10\nconsecutive business days, we will regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2).\nThe per share price of our ordinary shares has fluctuated significantly and has been below $1.00 per share. Our stock price may not close at or above $1.00\nper share and if the price remains below $1.00 per share, our stock could become subject to delisting. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on\nthe price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we can\nprovide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with listing requirements would allow our common stock to become listed again,\nstabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price\nrequirement or prevent future non-compliance with the listing requirements of Nasdaq.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nUse of Proceeds from Initial Public Offering\nOn January 27, 2022, we closed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 2,500,000 units (“Units”), each consisting of (i) one ordinary share, $0.0001 par\nvalue per share (the “Shares”), and (ii) one warrant (the “Warrants”) entitling the holder to purchase one Share at an exercise price of $6.00 per Share. The\nWarrants are immediately exercisable upon issuance and are exercisable for a period of five years after the issuance date. The Shares and Warrants were issued\nseparately in the IPO, and may be transferred separately immediately upon issuance. The underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase up to an\nadditional 375,000 Warrants. The Units were sold at a price of $6.00 per Unit, and the net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $12.4 million, after\ndeducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $1.1 million and offering expenses of approximately $1.5 million payable by us. No\npayments for such expenses were made directly or indirectly to (i) any of our officers or directors or their associates, (ii) any persons owning 10% or more of\nany class of our equity securities or (iii) any of our affiliates.\nIn connection with the IPO, we issued to the representative of the underwriters a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 50,000 Shares. The Benchmark\nCompany acted as lead book-running manager, and Northland Capital Markets acted as joint book-running manager. The offer and sale of the shares were\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) on a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-259457), which was\ndeclared effective on January 24, 2022.\nThere has been no material change in the expected use of the net proceeds from our IPO as described in our final prospectus, dated January 24, 2022, filed\nwith the SEC on January 26, 2022, pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act and our Post-Effective Amendment No.1 to Form S-1 filed on April 7, 2022.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nTrading Plans\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no director or executive officer adopted, modified or terminated a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\"\nor \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\", as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\n46\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.
