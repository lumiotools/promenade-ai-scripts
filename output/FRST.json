Receives Nasdaq Notice Regarding Delayed 10-Q Filing\n\n11/27/2024\n\nDownload(opens in new window)\n\nMCLEAN, Va., Nov. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Primis Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: FRST) (\"Primis\" or the \"Company\") announced today that, as expected, it received a notice (the \"Additional Notice\") from Nasdaq indicating that the Company remains noncompliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) because the Company has not filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (the \"Q2 Form 10-Q\") and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (the \"Q3 Form 10-Q\", and together with the Q2 Form 10-Q, the \"Form 10-Qs\"). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) requires listed companies to timely file all periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The Additional Notice also required that, pursuant to Listing Rule 5810(d) and 5810(b), the Company submit an update to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\") no later than November 28, 2024.\n\n[ ![Primis \\(PRNewsfoto/Primis Financial Corporation\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568729/Primis_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568729/Primis_Logo.html)\n\nAs previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 9, 2024, the Company did not regain compliance within the expiration of the 180-day extension that was previously granted by Nasdaq, and as a result, on October 3, 2024, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that the Company's shares would be delisted. On October 8, 2024, the Company appealed Nasdaq's determination in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules, requested a hearing before the Panel, and an extension of Nasdaq's stay of delisting. As previously disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on October 24, 2024, the Company received notice from Nasdaq that the temporary stay of delisting has been extended pending a hearing before the Panel on December 3, 2024, and the issuance of a final Panel decision.\n\nThe Company has filed the previously delayed 2023 Form 10-K and the 2024 Q1 Form 10-Q and plans to file the Form 10-Qs as promptly as practicable. As with the prior notices, the Additional Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Company currently expects to regain compliance in the near future.\n\n**_About Primis Financial Corp._**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Primis had $4.0 billion in total assets, $3.0 billion in total loans held for investment and $3.3 billion in total deposits.

This expanded team and line of business will give Primis the capabilities to capitalize on this critical section of the mortgage market with offerings that should boost non-CRE oriented loans and commercial deposits.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Primis Financial Corporation\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1475393/Primis_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1475393/Primis_Logo.html)\n\nRoberts and his team joined Primis from a large regional bank in Texas, where Roberts was the national sales manager of its successful warehouse lending division for just under a decade, averaging more than $1.0 billion in monthly loan balances and substantial commercial deposits. He and his team bring enormous technical expertise and reputation in the industry and will be very accretive to the Primis culture and brand.\n\n\"What stood out to me the most about Primis was how much executive leadership understands the values and risks of warehouse lending,\" Roberts said. \"The team at Primis has substantial experience and success in this industry, and their excitement and knowledge during our early conversations made it apparent that this partnership would be a successful one. Some of our best customers have met the executive team and understand that this is a bank that will partner with them for the long-term.\"\n\nProjections from national mortgage authorities like FNMA and FHLMC predict continued improvement in mortgage volumes over the coming years. The expanded Warehouse Lending Division will give Primis a distinct advantage as the mortgage market continues to expand. Since joining Primis in early October, Roberts and his team have quickly secured over 40 new clients from across the U.S., positioning Primis Bank as a critical funding partner for mortgage companies nationwide. \n\n\"I believe we have positioned ourselves in a very good place in this important industry. I am very excited to have Drey and his team in our Company, and I am inspired by their ambition and dedication to their long-time customers. Having met a dozen or so of their clients in person and seeing how fast we have on-boarded them from application to real funding, I am convinced that we can move the needle on profitability and operating results,\" Primis Bank CEO Dennis Zember said.\n\nTo learn more about the Primis Warehouse Lending Division, visit [primisbank.com](http://primisbank.com).\n\n**_About Primis Bank_**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Primis Financial Corp. had $4.0 billion in total assets, $2.9 billion in total loans held for investment and $3.3 billion in total deposits.

Reports Earnings per Share for the Third Quarter of 2024\n\n10/24/2024\n\nDownload(opens in new window)\n\n**Announces Sale of Life Premium Finance Division**\n\n**Announces Expansion of Mortgage Warehouse Lending Team**\n\n**Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.10 Per Share**\n\nMCLEAN, Va., Oct. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Primis Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: FRST) (\"Primis\" or the \"Company\"), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Primis Bank (the \"Bank\"), today reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.2 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of $6.0 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the year-to-date period in 2024, the Company reported earnings available to common and diluted earnings per share of $7.5 million and $0.30, respectively, compared to $0.3 million and $0.01, respectively, in the same period in 2023. Earnings for the three month and year-to-date periods are highly affected by the Company's corrected accounting for a third-party originated consumer portfolio.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Primis Financial Corporation\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1475393/Primis_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1475393/Primis_Logo.html)\n\nEarnings for the three month and year-to-date period in 2024 include $0.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively, or $0.03 and $0.09 per diluted share, respectively, of after-tax nonrecurring charges versus $11.3 million and $12.5 million, respectively, or $0.45 and $0.51 per diluted share, respectively in the comparable 2023 periods and inclusive of the goodwill impairment in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusting for these items, operating net income available to common shareholders was $2.0 million(1) or $0.08 per diluted share(1) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net operating income available to common shareholders of $5.3 million(1) or $0.21 per diluted share(1) for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the year-to-date period in 2024 when adjusting for these items, earnings available to common and diluted earnings per share was $9.6 million(1) and $0.39(1), respectively, compared to $12.8 million(1) and $0.52(1), respectively, in the same period in 2023. \n\n**Sale of Life Premium Finance Division**\n\nOn October 24, 2024, Primis Bank and EverBank, N.A. (\"EverBank\") entered into a purchase and assumption agreement whereby EverBank will acquire the Life Premium Finance Division from Primis Bank including all the associated loans, except for a subset of mostly fixed rate and rate-capped loans retained by the Bank, and the operations of the division, including its employees, for a premium of $6.0 million. Primis Bank expects to record a pre-tax gain of $4.5 million net of advisory and legal fees in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nOn October 31, 2024, EverBank will acquire approximately $370 million of loans from the division with Primis Bank providing interim servicing until the transition of the business at the final closing which is expected on January 31, 2025. Between the first and second closings, EverBank will purchase loans generated by the division in ordinary course at par. After the second closing, EverBank will service the Bank's retained portfolio for the duration of the portfolio.\n\nDennis J. Zember, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Primis commented, \"Three years ago we hired a set of professionals with a vision to build a tech-forward solution for life insurance premium finance. This platform has been widely accepted and used by the industry's facilitators to such a degree that its opportunity is bigger than our balance sheet. EverBank is known for investing in scalable businesses with attractive risk-adjusted returns which makes our life premium finance team a perfect fit.\"\n\n**Mortgage Warehouse Lending Team Expansion**\n\nIn early October of 2024, Primis hired a seasoned team of mortgage warehouse lending professionals from a larger bank with a very successful track record in this space. While Primis Bank has had mortgage warehouse lending capabilities for some time, production had been limited while the Bank searched for the right leadership. Four key individuals have joined the Bank comprising sales, operations and portfolio management with another four to five support staff expected in the coming months.\n\nCommented Mr. Zember, \"Mortgage warehouse lending as an asset class has very attractive returns and limited losses. With several very large banks exiting the space and mortgage volumes projected to increase substantially, we believe this is a perfect time to expand our capabilities. Knowing the team we hired and having visited quite a few of their customers, I believe we can replace all of the life premium business we are selling with yields that are 125bps to 150bps higher. I expect the credit results and operating expense burdens to be similar so we believe the bottom-line impact will be significant as we scale this operation.\"\n\n**_Discussion of Results_**\n\nThe following table highlights selected financial data for the last five quarters:\n\n**3Q 2024** | **2Q 2024** | **1Q 2024** | **4Q 2023** | **3Q 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nReturn on average assets | 0.12 % | 0.39 % | 0.26 % | (0.85 %) | (0.62 %)  \nOperating return on average assets(1) | 0.20 % | 0.50 % | 0.29 % | (0.79 %) | 0.54 %  \nPre-tax pre-provision return on average assets(1) | 0.85 % | 0.78 % | 1.02 % | 0.96 % | (0.33 %)  \nPre-tax pre-prov. operating return on average assets(1) | 0.95 % | 0.92 % | 1.05 % | 1.01 % | (0.30 %)  \nReturn on average common equity  | 1.28 % | 4.06 % | 2.62 % | (8.43 %) | (6.11 %)  \nOperating return on average common equity(1) | 2.11 % | 5.18 % | 2.99 % | (7.91 %) | 5.35 %  \nOperating return on avg. tangible common equity(1) | 2.80 % | 6.93 % | 3.98 % | (10.53 %) | 7.35 %  \nCost of funds | 3.25 % | 3.16 % | 2.97 % | 2.85 % | 2.75 %  \nNet interest margin | 2.97 % | 2.72 % | 2.84 % | 2.86 % | 2.70 %  \nGross loans to deposits | 89.68 % | 98.95 % | 97.37 % | 98.45 % | 96.37 %  \nEfficiency ratio  | 83.22 % | 82.62 % | 77.41 % | 81.31 % | 108.50 %  \nOperating efficiency ratio(1) | 80.35 % | 78.86 % | 76.17 % | 79.43 % | 75.17 %  \n  \nAs disclosed in our recent filings with the SEC, the Company has corrected its method for accounting for a third-party originated and serviced consumer loan portfolio (the \"Consumer Program\") and in which the separate agreements comprising the portfolio are treated as separate units of account (See \"Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\" in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K). A subset of the Consumer Program has promotional characteristics where interest is deferred during the promotional period and is waived if the customer pays off the loan prior to the period end. In that event, the third-party reimburses the Bank for the waived interest. Until the end of the promotional period, the Company is unable to accrue interest on the loan under GAAP but does record a derivative representing the fair value of expected interest reimbursements from the third-party. Credit costs are also fully included in the Company's results, including estimated life of loan losses required by ASC 326 while potential credit enhancements from the Consumer Program are only reflected as received. Total outstanding balances in the Consumer Program were $180 million as of September 30, 2024 versus $194 million at June 30, 2024.\n\n**_Net Interest Income_**\n\nNet interest income increased approximately $3.2 million, or 13%, to $28.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 largely due to increased interest recognition on previously deferring loans. For the third quarter of 2024, the Company reported a net interest margin of 2.97% versus 2.72% for the second quarter of 2024. \n\nInterest income increased 9.4% to $57.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $52.2 million during the second quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, $60 million of loans were deferring interest due to a promotional feature. The Company recognized $3.0 million of interest in the third quarter of 2024 from promotional loans that were deferring interest and then began amortizing. In addition, in the third quarter of 2024, payoff of promotional loans triggered reimbursement of $2.5 million of deferred interest that was recognized in noninterest income. Promotional loan balances of $17 million and $21 million will reach the end of their promotional periods in the fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025, respectively, after which loans with a promotional feature will decline to a nominal amount of the Bank's portfolio by the end of 2025. Yield on earning assets and loans held for investment were 6.06% and 6.31%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 versus 5.72% and 5.91%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024. \n\nInterest expense increased $1.7 million to $29.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 largely due to an increased reliance on FHLB funding during the third quarter. Cost of deposits increased 6 basis points to 3.04% in the third quarter of 2024 from 2.98% in the second quarter of 2024. Cost of funds was 3.25% in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 9 basis points linked-quarter.\n\n**_Noninterest Income_**\n\nNoninterest income decreased during the third quarter of 2024 to $9.3 million compared to $11.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. Included in the second quarter of 2024 is approximately $0.9 million of bank-owned life insurance income due to a death benefit payout. Income from mortgage banking activity increased $0.4 million during the third quarter. Offsetting the increase in mortgage banking income was a reduction of $0.4 million in service fees and $1.2 million reduction in income related to the Consumer Program. \n\n**_Noninterest Expense_**\n\nNoninterest expense was $31.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $29.8 million for the second quarter of 2024. Noninterest expense also includes consolidated expenses from Panacea Financial Holdings (\"PFH\"). Management considers the core expense burden of the Bank that adjusts for certain items such as those that are volume dependent (e.g., mortgage banking related) or nonoperational (e.g., changes in the reserve for unfunded commitments). The following table illustrates the degree to which the Company has managed its operating expense burden during 2024:\n\n**3Q 2024** | **2Q 2024** | **1Q 2024** | **4Q 2023** | **3Q 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nReported Noninterest Expense  | 31,045 | 29,786 | 27,538 | 27,780 | 36,950  \nPFH Consolidated Expenses  | (2,666) | (2,347) | (2,119) | (2,813) | -  \nNoninterest Expense Excl. PFH  | 28,379 | 27,439 | 25,419 | 24,967 | 36,950  \nNonrecurring / Goodwill Impair.  | (1,352) | (1,453) | (438) | (165) | (11,350)  \nMortgage Expenses  | (6,436) | (6,084) | (5,122) | (4,785) | (5,108)  \nConsumer Program Servicing Fee  | (699) | (312) | (312) | (312) | (312)  \nReserve for Unfunded Commitment  | (96) | 546 | 2 | (554) | 257  \nTotal Adjustments  | (8,583) | (7,303) | (5,870) | (5,816) | (16,513)  \nCore Operating Expense Burden  | 19,796 | 20,136 | 19,550 | 19,151 | 20,437  \n  \nAs noted above, the core expense burden decreased $0.3 million in the third quarter of 2024 from the second quarter of 2024. Core expense burden was $19.8 million, in line with the average for the last five quarters.\n\n**_Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality_**\n\nLoans held for investment decreased to $2.97 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $3.30 billion at June 30, 2024. As noted above, the Bank has entered into an agreement to sell approximately $370 million of life premium finance loans and which have been reclassified to loans held for sale at September 30, 2024. Including these balances, loans held for investment would have increased 1.1% unannualized in the third quarter of 2024. The Panacea and Life Premium Finance divisions had loan growth of 4.4% and 11.1%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nNonperforming assets, excluding portions guaranteed by the SBA, were only 0.25% of total assets, or $10.2 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.25% or $9.9 million at June 30, 2024. Loans rated substandard were $47.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $15.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase was largely driven by a single commercial credit that has experienced slower lease activity past its construction phase. Management evaluated and valued the property using conservative cap rates and lengthy times to lease and included the shortfall in its specific reserve. The Bank had no other real estate owned at the end of the third quarter of 2024. \n\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $7.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 versus $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. Of this provision, $4.0 million was due to Consumer Program activity. The remaining provision was due to specific reserves established on individually evaluated credits, approximately $2.2 million of which was tied to the commercial credit described above. As a percentage of loans, including life premium finance loans classified as held-for-sale at the end of the third quarter, the allowance for credit losses was 1.53% and 1.56% at the end of the third and second quarter of 2024, respectively.\n\nNet charge-offs were $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, up from $5.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. Consumer Program net charge-offs were $6.7 million in the third quarter versus $4.4 million in the second quarter of 2024. Core net charge-offs, excluding those losses from the Consumer Program, were $1.3 million, or 0.15% of average loans, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.6 million, or 0.07%, in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**_Deposits and Funding_**\n\nTotal deposits at September 30, 2024 decreased slightly to $3.31 billion from $3.34 billion at June 30, 2024. Importantly, noninterest bearing deposits were $421 million at September 30, 2024, up slightly from $420 million at June 30, 2024 and in the face of substantial remixing activity towards interest bearing accounts.\n\nDeposit growth in the Bank continues to benefit from better technology and unique convenience factors. V1BE, the Bank's proprietary invitation-only delivery tool, increased total users by 5% during the third quarter of 2024, and now has over 2,400 users on the platform as of September 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Bank opened approximately $32.5 million new deposit accounts on the digital platform with very modest marketing expenses. At quarter end, the Bank had over 17,000 digital accounts with $911 million in total deposits and average balances of approximately $53 thousand.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank has $75.0 million of brokered CDs that mature at the end of 2024 and $165.0 million of short-term FHLB advances. \n\n**_Lines of Business_**\n\nThe Panacea Financial Division continues to experience substantial growth alongside the development of the nationally-recognized Panacea Financial brand. The Panacea Financial Division finished the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $392 million in outstanding loans, an increase of $16.5 million from June 30, 2024. Panacea-related deposits were $90 million at September 30, 2024 with a weighted average cost of 2.00%. Panacea continues to roll out innovative technology capabilities that is expected to continue increasing the amount with which it self-funds its balance sheet.\n\nPrimis Mortgage had pre-tax income of $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 up from $0.9 million in the previous quarter. Locked loan volumes averaged $56.1 million per month in the third quarter of 2024, up from $52.0 million per month in the second quarter of 2024. Primis Mortgage continues to aggressively manage costs to preserve profitability in a lower volume environment while selectively adding talent to grow production. \n\n**_Shareholders' Equity_**\n\nBook value per common share as of September 30, 2024 was $15.43, an increase of $0.20 from June 30, 2024. Tangible book value per common share(1) at the end of the third quarter of 2024 was $11.61, an increase of $0.21 from June 30, 2024. Common shareholders' equity was $381 million, or 9.48% of total assets, at September 30, 2024. Tangible common equity(1) at September 30, 2024 was $287 million, or 7.30% of tangible assets(1). After-tax unrealized losses on the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio decreased by $6.0 million to $17.1 million due to decreases in market interest rates during the third quarter of 2024. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity or recovery of the value and does not anticipate realizing any losses on the investments.\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per share payable on November 22, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 8, 2024. This is Primis' fifty-second consecutive quarterly dividend. \n\n**_About Primis Financial Corp._**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Primis had $4.0 billion in total assets, $2.9 billion in total loans held for investment and $3.3 billion in total deposits. Primis Bank provides a range of financial services to individuals and small- and medium-sized businesses through twenty-four full-service branches in Virginia and Maryland and provides services to customers through certain online and mobile applications.\n\n_Contacts_ : | _Address_ :  \n---|---  \nDennis J.

Primis uses non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its performance. The measures entitled net income adjusted for nonrecurring income and expenses; pre-tax pre-provision operating earnings; operating return on average assets; pre-tax pre-provision operating return on average assets; operating return on average equity; operating return on average tangible equity; operating efficiency ratio; operating earnings per share – basic; operating earnings per share – diluted; tangible book value per share; tangible common equity; tangible common equity to tangible assets; and core net interest margin are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We use the term \"operating\" to describe a financial measure that excludes income or expense considered to be non-recurring in nature. Items identified as non-operating are those that, when excluded from a reported financial measure, provide management or the reader with a measure that may be more indicative of forward-looking trends in our business. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures is provided in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items table.\n\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information about Primis that allows management and investors to evaluate the ongoing operating results, financial strength and performance of Primis and provide meaningful comparison to its peers. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider Primis' performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of Primis. Non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized and, therefore, it may not be possible to compare these measures with other companies that present measures having the same or similar names.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nThis press release and certain of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain statements that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of, and subject to the protections of, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Factors that might cause such\ndifferences include, but are not limited to: the result of the “pre-clearance” process with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC and the impact on the Company’s financial\nstatements; the possibility that the Company is unable to regain compliance with, or thereafter continue to comply with, applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules, or experience violations of\nadditional Nasdaq Listing Rules; the possibility that Nasdaq may deny the Company’s appeal and delist the Company’s securities; the Company’s ability to implement its various\nstrategic and growth initiatives, including [the sale of the Life Premium Finance Division and the impact on our operating results] and its recently established Panacea Financial\nDivision and digital banking platform, V1BE fulfillment service and Primis Mortgage Company; competitive pressures among financial institutions increasing significantly; changes in\napplicable laws, rules, or regulations, including changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or practices; changes in management’s plans for the future; credit risk associated\nwith our lending activities; the impact of current and future economic and market conditions generally (including seasonality) and in the financial services industry, nationally and within\nour primary market areas; changes in interest rates, inflation, loan demand, real estate values, or competition, as well as labor shortages and supply chain disruptions; changes in\naccounting principles, policies, or guidelines; adverse results from current or future litigation, regulatory examinations or other legal and/or regulatory actions; potential impacts of\nadverse developments in the banking industry highlighted by high-profile bank failures, including impacts on customer confidence, deposit outflows, liquidity and the regulatory\nresponse thereto; potential increases in the provision for credit losses; our ability to identify and address increased cybersecurity risks, including those impacting vendors and other\nthird parties; fraud or misconduct by internal or external actors, which we may not be able to prevent, detect or mitigate; acts of God or of war or other conflicts, including the current\nUkraine/Russia conflict and Israel/Hamas conflict, acts of terrorism, pandemics or other catastrophic events that may affect general economic conditions; and other general\ncompetitive, economic, political, and market factors, including those affecting our business, operations, pricing, products, or services.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made. These forward-looking statements are based upon information presently known to the\nCompany’s management and are inherently subjective, uncertain and subject to change due to any number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, the risks and other\nfactors set forth in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under\nthe captions “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors,” and in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made, or to reflect the\noccurrence of unanticipated events. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.\n2\nStatements included in this presentation include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables. Primis\nuses non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its performance. The measures entitled net income adjusted for nonrecurring income and\nexpenses; pre-tax pre-provision operating earnings; operating return on average assets; pre-tax pre-provision operating return on average assets;\noperating return on average equity; operating return on average tangible equity; operating efficiency ratio; operating earnings per share – basic;\noperating earnings per share – diluted; tangible book value per share; tangible common equity; tangible common equity to tangible assets; and\ncore net interest margin are not measures recognized under GAAP and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We use the term\n“operating” to describe a financial measure that excludes income or expense considered to be non-recurring in nature. Items identified as non-\noperating are those that, when excluded from a reported financial measure, provide management or the reader with a measure that may be more\nindicative of forward-looking trends in our business. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP\nmeasures is provided in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items table.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional useful information about Primis that allows management and\ninvestors to evaluate the ongoing operating results, financial strength and performance of Primis and provide meaningful comparison to its peers.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated\nunder GAAP, and investors should consider Primis’ performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant\ninformation when assessing the performance or financial condition of Primis. Non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized and, therefore,\nit may not be possible to compare these measures with other companies that present measures having the same or similar names.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.\n3\nCorp.

The Company\nreceived a non-objection from the SEC to the Company’s accounting conclusions required to correct the prior accounting for\nthe Consumer Program. As a result, in consultation with the Company’s Audit Committee to its Board of Directors and its\nindependent registered public accounting firm, Forvis Mazars, LLP, management determined that the corrections to the\nConsumer Program accounting was material to the financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023,\nwhich are also being restated in this Form 10-Q/A. The correction to the Consumer Program accounting in the financial\nstatements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was not deemed to be material, but for comparison purposes\nto the current period in this Form 10-Q/A the Company has revised the prior period amounts as applicable.\nFor a more detailed description of the financial impact of the Restatement, see the “Restatement of Previously Issued\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements” section of Note 1 – Accounting Policies, to the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contained in this Amendment and “Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements”\nunder Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” contained in\nthis Amendment.\nItems Amended in the Form 10-Q/A\nThe following items are amended and restated in their entirety in this Amendment: (i) Part I, Item 1, “Financial\nStatements”; Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”; and Item 4,\n“Controls and Procedures”; and (ii) Part II, Item 6, “Exhibits”.\nPursuant to Rule 12b-15 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), this\nAmendment also contains new currently dated certifications by the Company's principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nExcept as described above, this Amendment does not amend, update or change any other disclosures in the Original 10-Q.\nIn addition, the information contained in this Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original 10-\nQ and does not modify or update the disclosures therein.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Revised and Restated)\nPrimis Financial Corp. (“Primis,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is the bank holding company for Primis Bank\n(“Primis Bank” or the “Bank”), a Virginia state-chartered bank which commenced operations on April 14, 2005. Primis Bank\nprovides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses.\nAs of March 31, 2023, Primis Bank had thirty-two full-service branches in Virginia and Maryland and also provided\nservices to customers through certain online and mobile applications. Thirty full-service retail branches are in Virginia and\ntwo full-service retail branches are in Maryland. The Company is headquartered in McLean, Virginia and has administrative\noffices in Tysons Corner, Virginia and Glen Allen, Virginia and an operations center in Atlee, Virginia.\nThe accounting policies and practices of Primis and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“U.S. GAAP”) and to general practice within the banking industry. Major policies and practices are described\nbelow and have not changed significantly from the policies and practices disclosed in the Company’s restated Annual Report\non Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022, except where specifically highlighted below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Primis and its subsidiaries Primis Bank, Primis Mortgage\nCompany and EVB Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”). Significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated\nin consolidation. Primis consolidates subsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the voting\nrights or where it exercises control. Entities where Primis holds 20 to 50 percent of the voting rights, or has the ability to\nexercise significant influence, or both, are accounted for under the equity method. Primis owns the Trust which is an\nunconsolidated subsidiary and the junior subordinated debt owed to the Trust is reported as a liability of Primis.\nWe determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting\ninterest entity or a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. Voting interest entities are entities in which the total\nequity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and provides the equity holders with\nthe obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity’s activities.\nWe consolidate voting interest entities in which we have all, or at least a majority of, the voting interest. As defined in\napplicable accounting standards, VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE is present when an enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that\nmost significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits\nthat could potentially be significant to the VIE. The enterprise with a controlling financial interest, known as the primary\nbeneficiary, consolidates the VIE. The Company has investments in VIE’s for which we are not the primary beneficiary and,\nas such, are not included in our consolidated financial statements.\nOn May 31, 2022, Primis Bank completed the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of\nSeaTrust Mortgage Company (“SeaTrust”), a North Carolina corporation from Community First Bank, Inc. (the “Seller”)\npursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2022 (the “Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Bank,\nSeller, and SeaTrust. As a result, SeaTrust became a wholly owned subsidiary of Primis Bank on May 31, 2022. Following the\nclosing of the Acquisition, on June 1, 2022, the Bank changed the name of SeaTrust to Primis Mortgage Company (“Primis\nMortgage”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Bank paid an aggregate purchase price of $7.0 million in cash to Seller\nat closing and assumed $19.3 million of SeaTrust’s indebtedness under certain warehouse lending facilities.\nThe table below illustrates the unaudited pro forma revenue and net income of the combined entities had the acquisition\ntaken place on January 1, 2022. The unaudited combined pro forma revenue and net income combines the historical results of\nSeaTrust with the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the periods listed below and, while no material\nadjustments were made for the estimated effect of certain fair value adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are\nnot indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition actually taken place on January 1, 2022. The pro forma\n6\nTable of Contents\nfinancial information does not include the impact of possible business model changes, nor does it consider any potential\nimpacts of current market conditions or revenues, expense efficiencies or other factors.\n(dollars in thousands) For the three months ended March 31, 2022\nTotal revenues $ 30,817\nNet income $ 4,376\nOperating Segments\nThe Company, through its Bank subsidiary, provides a broad range of financial services. While the Company’s chief\noperating decision makers monitor the revenue streams of the various financial products and services, operations are managed\nand financial performance is evaluated on an organization-wide basis. Management has determined that the Company has two\nreportable operating segments: Primis Mortgage and Primis Bank, as discussed in Note 11 – Segment Information.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for\ninterim financial information and instructions for Form 10-Q and follow general practice within the banking industry.\nAccordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by\nU.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of\nnormal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented have been made. The\nresults of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.\nFor further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Primis’ restated\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nReclassifications\nIn certain instances, amounts reported in the prior year annual audited consolidated financial statements or the interim\ncondensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and\nthe reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nEstimates that are particularly susceptible to change in the near term include: the determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses, the fair value of investment securities, credit impairment of investment securities, the valuation of goodwill and\ndeferred tax assets. Management monitors and continually reassess these at each reporting period.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, when accounting for loan participations and\nother partial loan sales. Transfers of an entire financial asset (i.e. loan sales), a group of entire financial assets, or a\nparticipating interest in an entire financial asset (i.e. loan participations sold) are accounted for as sales when control over the\nassets have been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been\nisolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking that right) to\npledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets\nthrough an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. Participations or other partial loan sales that do not meet the\ndefinition of a participating interest would remain on the balance sheet and the proceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing.\nSecured borrowings are initially recorded at fair value which corresponds to the proceeds received\n7\nTable of Contents\nfor the transfer of the assets, and any failed sale discount is amortized into income over the life of the related asset. The\nCompany retains servicing rights on loans transferred under secured borrowings, but in accordance with U.S. GAAP does not\nrecord a servicing asset. The Company transferred $15.1 million in principal balance of loans to another financial institution\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023 that were accounted for as secured borrowings. As of March 31, 2023 the\namortized cost of those loans recorded in loans held for investment in our balance sheet was $15.1 million. None of the loans\nwere past due or on nonaccrual as of March 31, 2023 and we had no charge-offs of these loans during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023. See Note 7 – Debt and Other Borrowings – for additional information on transfers accounted for as secured\nborrowings.\nRetained Earnings Revisions\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company discovered an employee loan fraud with total exposure of approximately\n$2.5 million. The fraud dated back to the origination of several loans to a customer in 2010. Management believes, on the\nadvice of its counsel, its insurance broker and a third party forensic auditor, that the losses are recoverable under the\nCompany’s insurance policies and is working through the claims process. The Company has evaluated the effect of the error,\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively, and believes the impact to prior years is immaterial to each respective period assessed.\nHowever, the Company’s quantitative and qualitative assessments of the fraud losses on its projected 2023 annual earnings\nwas expected to be material at the time the evaluation was performed as of June 30, 2023. Accordingly, the Company made\nthe decision to report the losses in the respective periods in which they were incurred in its future Form 10-Q and Form 10-K\nfilings by revising impacted periods beginning with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as of June 30, 2023. For all of its\nfilings on and after June 30, 2023, the Company revised opening retained earnings of the earliest period presented for losses\nincurred in earlier periods and revised all prior periods presented in the filing for losses incurred related to the period.\nAccordingly, the Company has revised prior periods presented in this Form 10-Q/A to reflect the fraud losses in the respective\nperiod incurred, with any losses incurred prior to January 1, 2022 adjusted in the January 1, 2022 opening retained earnings\nbalance as previously reported in the Company’s restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nThe table below discloses the net change (increase or (decrease)) included in each condensed consolidated statements of\nincome and comprehensive income (loss) line items in this Form 10-Q/A, as a result of the revisions discussed above. The\nrevisions to the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 resulted in no change on previously reported basic and diluted\nEPS from continuing operations.\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nIncome Statement:\nDecrease in interest income $ (45) $ (25)\nIncrease in noninterest expenses 9 45\nDecrease in income tax expense (11) (14)\nNet decrease in net income from continuing operations $ (43) $ (56)\nRestatement and Revision of Previously Issued Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nOn February 26, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Company’s management\nteam concluded, following discussions with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Forvis Mazars,\nLLP (“Forvis”), that the Company’s previously issued unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of\nand for the three months ended March 31, 2023 should no longer be relied upon.\nThe accounting matters underlying the Company’s conclusion related to transfers of loans by the Company’s subsidiary,\nPrimis Bank, of approximately $15.1 million (the “Transferred Loans”) to another financial institution during the first quarter\nof 2023. As part of the Company’s 2023 year-end reporting process in the first quarter of 2024, the Company determined that\nthe transfer of the Transferred Loans from Primis Bank to the other financial institution did not qualify for sales treatment\nunder U.S. GAAP and should have been accounted for as secured borrowings. The Company’s management team then\nundertook extensive discussions with Forvis regarding the effect of the mischaracterization of the\n8\nTable of Contents\ntransfers on the Company’s reported financial results, and ultimately determined that the Impacted Financial Statements\nshould be restated.\nAdditionally, during the 2023 annual independent audit of the Company by Forvis, the Company pursued a pre-clearance\nprocess with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC related accounting for the Consumer Program loan portfolio as\nmore fully described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company received a\nnon-objection from the SEC to the Company’s accounting conclusions required to correct the prior accounting for the\nConsumer Program. As a result, in consultation with the Company’s Audit Committee to its Board of Directors and its\nindependent registered public accounting firm, Forvis, management determined that the corrections to the Consumer Program\naccounting was material to the financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which are also being\nrestated in this Form 10-Q/A. The correction to the Consumer Program accounting in the financial statements as of and for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022 was not deemed to be material, but for comparison purposes to the current period in this\nForm 10-Q/A the Company has revised the prior period amounts as applicable.\nThe primary effects of the restatements for the failed loan sale and Consumer Program as of March 31, 2023, and for the\nthree-month period then ended are shown below.\nAs of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2023\n(In thousands, expect per share data)\nAs Revised1,\nCondensed Consolidated

Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)\n2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance on troubled\ndebt restructurings (TDRs) for creditors in ASC 310-40 and amends the guidance on “vintage disclosures” to require\ndisclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination. The ASU also updates the requirements related to\naccounting for credit losses under FASB ASC 326 and adds enhanced disclosures for creditors with respect to loan refinancing\nand restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company adopted the guidance in the\n11\nTable of Contents\nfirst quarter of 2023, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and\ndisclosures.\n2.

With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed securities\nissued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices less than the\namortized cost basis of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities. With regard to securities\nissued by States and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management considers (i) issuer bond ratings,\n(ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments\nunder the contractual terms of the securities and (iv) internal forecasts. As of March 31, 2023, Primis had an immaterial\nallowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities.\nThe unrealized losses related to investment securities available-for-sale identified as of March 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, relate to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-\nrelated impairment. Primis performs quantitative and qualitative analysis in this determination. As a result of the Company’s\nanalysis, none of the securities were deemed to require an allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2023 and\n13\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to\nmeet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or\nnot a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower’s debt service\ncapacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with regards to our\ncollateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on nonaccrual status if (i) principal\nor interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of\ncollection or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of\nwhether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is\nreversed. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of\nprincipal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are\nbrought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured, which is typically\nevidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the aging of the recorded investment in past due loans by class of loans held for investment as\nof March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\n30 -

Many aspects of the borrower’s financial situation are assessed when\ndetermining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial borrowers due to the\ncomplex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions may include the\nreduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rates for a new loan with similar risk, extension of the maturity\ndate, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has been granted, the Bank\nalso considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether such additions adequately\ncompensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those currently being offered to new\nloan customers.\nThe assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time a concession has been granted is\nsubjective in nature and management’s judgment is required when determining whether the concession results in a\nmodification that is accounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan under U.S. GAAP.\nAlthough each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, loans modified\nas a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically modified through reduction in interest rates, reductions\nin payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions in term maturity.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2023, one loan from our residential 1-4 family loan portfolio on an amortized cost basis\nof $0.9 million, was modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. This modification allowed a six month deferral\nof principal and interest of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, with contractual payments expected to\nresume in August of this year. This loan, which has had no payment delinquencies since origination, represents only 0.15% of\ntotal loans in the secured by first liens pool.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset\nupon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss\ninformation, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Because\nthe effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for\ncredit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit\nlosses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies certain loans by providing principal\nforgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written off against the allowance.\nThe amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off,\nresulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses.\nIf it is determined that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a\nportion of the loan) is written off. At that time, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and\nthe allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nThrough its system of internal controls, Primis evaluates and segments loan portfolio credit quality using regulatory\ndefinitions for Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Special Mention loans are considered to be criticized. Substandard\nand Doubtful loans are considered to be classified.\nSpecial Mention loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserve management’s close attention. If left\nuncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the\ninstitution’s credit position.\nSubstandard loans may be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the\ncollateral pledged if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the\ndebt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not\ncorrected.\nDoubtful loans have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the\nweaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly\nquestionable and improbable. Primis had no loans classified Doubtful at March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nIn monitoring credit quality trends in the context of assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses on\nloans, we monitor portfolio credit quality by the weighted-average risk grade of each class of loan.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents weighted-average risk grades for all loans, by class and year of origination/renewal as of\nMarch 31, 2023 (in thousands) :\nRevolving\nLoans\nRevolving Converted\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Loans To Term Total\nCommercial real estate -

The amount of the\nallowance represents management's best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available information,\nfrom internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans' contractual terms, adjusted for expected\nprepayments when appropriate.\nIn calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and\nrisk profiles. For allowance modeling purposes, our loan pools include but are not limited to (i) commercial real estate - owner\noccupied, (ii) commercial real estate - non-owner occupied, (iii) construction and land development, (iv) commercial, (v)\nagricultural loans, (vi) residential 1-4 family and (vii) consumer loans. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans\nwithin the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether further segmentation is\nnecessary. For each loan pool, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing a combination of inputs:\n(i) probability of default, (ii) probability of attrition, (iii) loss given default and (iv) exposure at default. Internal data is\nsupplemented by, but not replaced by, peer data when required, primarily to determine the probability of default input. The\nvarious pool-specific inputs may be adjusted for current macroeconomic assumptions. Significant macroeconomic variables\nutilized in our allowance models include, among other things, (i) VA Gross Domestic Product, (ii) VA House Price Index, and\n(iii) VA unemployment rates.\nManagement qualitatively adjusts allowance model results for risk factors that are not considered within our quantitative\nmodeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. Qualitative\nfactor (“Q-Factor”) adjustments are driven by key risk indicators that management tracks on a pool-by-pool basis.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate\nthe loan from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an\nindividual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation.\nThe following tables present details of the allowance for credit losses on loans segregated by loan portfolio segment as of\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, calculated in accordance with the current expected credit losses (“CECL”)\nmethodology (in thousands).\nCommercial Commercial Home\nReal Estate Real Estate Construction Equity\nOwner Non-owner Secured by and Land 1-4 Family Multi-Family Lines Of Commercial Consumer PCD\nMarch 31, 2023 Occupied Occupied Farmland Development Residential Residential Credit Loans Loans Loans Total\nModeled expected credit\nlosses $ 4,909 6,203 2 872 3,890 1,723 328 4,798 6,798 — $ 29,523\nQ-factor and other\nqualitative adjustments 395 727 19 408 453 364 22 869 4 — 3,261\nSpecific allocations — 231 — — — — — 843 — 1,945 3,019\nTotal $ 5,304 $ 7,161 $ 21 $ 1,280 $ 4,343 $ 2,087 $ 350 $ 6,510 $ 6,802 $ 1,945 $ 35,803\nCommercial Commercial Home\nReal Estate Real Estate Construction Equity\nOwner Non-owner Secured by and Land 1-4 Family Multi-Family Lines Of Commercial Consumer PCD\nDecember 31, 2022 Occupied Occupied Farmland Development Residential Residential Credit Loans Loans Loans Total\nModeled expected credit\nlosses $ 5,297 $ 6,652 $ 4 $ 997 $ 3,579 $ 1,814 $ 310 $ 5,006 $ 3,851 $ — $ 27,510\nQ-factor and other\nqualitative adjustments 261 495 21 376 512 387 19 654 2 — 2,727\nSpecific allocations — — — — — — — 2,193 42 2,072 4,307\nTotal $ 5,558 $ 7,147 $ 25 $ 1,373 $ 4,091 $ 2,201 $ 329 $ 7,853 $ 3,895 $ 2,072 $ 34,544\nNo allowance for credit losses has been recognized for PPP loans as such loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA.\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by class of loan for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 is\nsummarized below (in thousands):\nCommercial Commercial\nReal Estate Real Estate Construction Home Equity\nOwner Non-owner Secured by and Land 1-4 Family Multi-Family Lines Of Commercial Consumer PCD\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2023 Occupied Occupied Farmland Development Residential Residential Credit Loans Loans Loans Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 5,558$ 7,147$ 25$ 1,373$ 4,091$ 2,201$ 329$ 7,853$ 3,895$ 2,072$ 34,544\nProvision (recovery) (254) 14 (4) (205) 266 (114) 21 423 5,243 (127) 5,263\nCharge offs — — — — (175) — — (1,766) (2,483) — (4,424)\nRecoveries — — — 112 161 — — — 147 — 420\nEnding balance $ 5,304$ 7,161$ 21$ 1,280$ 4,343$ 2,087$ 350$ 6,510$ 6,802$ 1,945$ 35,803\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2022\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 4,562$ 9,028$ 56$ 998$ 3,588$ 3,280$ 437$ 4,088$ 787$ 2,281$ 29,105\nProvision (recovery) (389) (115) (7) 31 243 (991) (47) 1,208 276 (110) 99\nCharge offs — — — — — — (14) — (47) — (61)\nRecoveries — — — — 57 — — 170 9 — 236\nEnding balance $ 4,173$ 8,913$ 49$ 1,029$ 3,888$ 2,289$ 376$ 5,466$ 1,025$ 2,171$ 29,379\nGenerally, a commercial loan, or a portion thereof, is charged-off when it is determined, through the analysis of any\navailable current financial information with regards to the borrower, that the borrower is incapable of servicing unsecured\ndebt, there is little or no prospect for near term improvement and no realistic strengthening action of significance is pending\nor, in the case of secured debt, when it is determined, through analysis of current information with regards to our collateral\nposition, that amounts due from the borrower are in excess of the calculated current fair value of the collateral.

DERIVATIVES (Restated)\nConsumer Program Derivative\nThe Company has a derivative instrument in connection with its agreement with a third-party that originates loans that are\nheld on the Company’s balance sheet. The third-party provides credit support and reimbursement for lost interest under the\nagreement and the Company provides performance fees to the third-party on performing loans. Specifically, a portion of the\noriginated loans are originated with a promotional period where interest accrues on the loans but is not owed to the Company\nunless and until the loan begins to amortize. If the borrower prepays the principal on the loan prior to the end of the\npromotional period the accrued interest is waived, but becomes due to the Company from the third-party under the agreement.\nThis expected payment of waived interest to the Company along with performance fees due to the third-party comprise the\nvalue of the derivative.\nThe fair value of the derivative instrument was an asset of $10.0 million recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in\n“Consumer Program derivative asset” as of March 31, 2023 and a liability of $0.5 million recorded in the consolidated balance\nsheets in “Consumer Program derivative liability” as of December 31, 2022. The underlying expected cash flows were $12.9\nmillion and $0.6 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company calculates the fair value of\nthis derivative using a discounted cash flow model using inputs that are inherently judgmental and reflect management’s best\nestimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate the fair value. The most significant inputs and\nassumptions in determining the value of the derivative are noted below ($ in thousands).\n26\nTable of Contents\nMarch 31, 2023\nWeighted\nLow High Average\nRemaining cumulative charge-offs $ 878 $ 17,062 $ n/a\nRemaining cumulative promotional prepayments $ 38,496 $ 70,355 $ 46,214\nAverage life (years) n/a n/a 1.8\nDiscount rate 4.12% 14.15% 14.07%\nDecember 31, 2022\nWeighted\nLow High Average\nRemaining cumulative charge-offs $ — $ 6,777 $ n/a\nRemaining cumulative promotional prepayments $ 26,211 $ 47,902 $ 30,251\nAverage life (years) n/a n/a 2.2\nDiscount rate 4.21% 14.25% 8.53%\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the total Consumer Program derivative income was $11.4\nmillion and $54 thousand, respectively, and was recorded in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and\nComprehensive Income (Loss). The $11.4 million in 2023 was comprised of $10.5 million of fair value gains on the derivative\nvaluation adjustments and income of $0.9 million related to the credit support and reimbursement of lost interest due from the\nthird-party under the agreement. The $54 thousand in 2022 was comprised of $68 thousand of income related to the credit\nsupport and reimbursement of lost interest due from the third-party under the agreement, net of fair value losses of $14\nthousand related to derivative valuation adjustments.\nMortgage Banking Derivatives and Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into IRLCs (“interest rate lock commitments”) to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale, at\nspecified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 90 days), with borrowers who have\napplied for a loan and have met certain credit and underwriting criteria. The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated costs to\noriginate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the pullthrough\nrate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is estimated on\nchanges in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC closing rates. The\nCompany obtains an analysis from a third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the pullthrough estimate.\nBest efforts and mandatory forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both\nbest efforts and mandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Forward loan sale commitments that are\nmandatory delivery are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be\nnecessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Forward loan sale commitments that are best\nefforts are not derivatives but can be and have been accounted for at fair value, determined in a similar manner to those that\nare mandatory delivery. Forward loan sale commitments are recorded on the balance sheet as derivative assets and derivative\nliabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in mortgage banking income in the statement of operations.\nThe key unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of IRLCs are as follows for the three months ended March\n31, 2023:\nInputs\nAverage pullthrough rates 88.98%\nAverage costs to originate 1.36%\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe following summarizes derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nMarch 31, 2023\nFair Notional\nDerivative financial instruments: Value Amount\nDerivative assets (1) $ 1,355 $ 44,903\nDerivative liabilities $ 453 $ 55,000\n(1) Pullthrough rate adjusted\nMarch 31, 2023\nFair Notional\nNon-derivative financial instruments: Value Amount\nBest efforts assets $ 78 $ 8,600\nDecember 31, 2022\nFair Notional\nDerivative financial instruments: Value Amount\nDerivative assets (1) $ 921 $ 25,368\nDerivative liabilities $ 98 $ 25,028\n(1) Pullthrough rate adjusted\nDecember 31, 2022\nFair Notional\nNon-derivative financial instruments: Value Amount\nBest efforts assets $ 18 $ 2,658\nThe notional amounts of mortgage loans held for sale not committed to investors was $17.0 million and $20.0 million as of\nMarch 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe Company has exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non-performance by its trading counterparties in\nderivative instruments that the Company uses in its rate risk management activities. The Company manages this credit risk by\nselecting only counterparties that the Company believes to be financially strong, spreading the risk among multiple\ncounterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and by\nentering into netting agreements with counterparties, as appropriate.\n5. FAIR VALUE (Revised and Restated)\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to\nmeasure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the\nability to access as of the measurement date\nLevel 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data\n28\nTable of Contents\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a

Fair value of net\nloans, time deposits, junior subordinated debt, and senior subordinated notes are measured using the exit-price notion.\n31\nTable of Contents\n6. LEASES\nThe Company leases certain premises and equipment under operating leases. In recognizing lease right-of-use assets and\nrelated liabilities, we account for lease and non-lease components (such as taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance\ncosts) separately as such amounts are generally readily determinable under our lease contracts. At March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company had operating lease liabilities totaling $9.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, and right-\nof-use assets totaling $9.4 million and $5.3 million, respectively, related to these leases. Operating lease liabilities and right-\nof-use assets are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not currently have any financing leases. For the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, our net operating lease costs were $0.6 million. These net operating lease costs are\nreflected in occupancy expenses on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss).\nThe following table presents other information related to our operating leases:\nFor the Three Months Ended\n(in thousands except for percent and period data) March 31, 2023 March 31, 2022\nOther information:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases, in years 7.6 4.4\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases 3.7% 2.5%\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of remaining lease liabilities:\nAs of\n(dollars in thousands) March 31, 2023\nLease payments due:\n2023 $ 1,572\n2024 1,655\n2025 1,230\n2026 1,169\n2027 1,133\nThereafter 4,810\nTotal lease payments 11,569\nLess: imputed interest (1,770)\nLease liabilities $ 9,799\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had one operating lease that has not yet commenced that will create additional lease\nliabilities and right-of-use assets for the Company.\n7. DEBT AND OTHER BORROWINGS (Restated)\nOther borrowings can consist of FHLB convertible advances, FHLB of Atlanta overnight advances, FHLB advances\nmaturing within one year, federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repo”) that mature\nwithin one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The balance in repo accounts at March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 was $4.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had pledged callable agency securities, residential government-sponsored\nmortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with a carrying value of $13.9 million and $14.2 million,\nrespectively, to customers who require collateral for overnight repurchase agreements and deposits.\nWe repaid our short-term FHLB advances of $325.0 million that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and matured\nin the first quarter of 2023. As a result, we have all of our FHLB capacity available for future liquidity needs. At March 31,\n2023, Primis Bank had lendable collateral value in the form of residential 1-4 family mortgages, HELOCs,\n32\nTable of Contents\ncommercial mortgage loans, and investment securities supporting borrowing capacity of approximately $541.6 million from\nthe FHLB.\nIn March 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) in response to recent industry\ndisruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to eligible depository institutions in exchange for pledged collateral\nin the form of U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets. Borrowing capacity\nunder the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of the collateral. At March 31, 2023, we had securities available of\n$165.0 million for utilization with the BTFP, with no borrowings outstanding under the program at March 31, 2023.\nIn 2017, the Company assumed $10.3 million of trust preferred securities that were issued on September 17, 2003 and\nplaced through a trust in a pooled underwriting totaling approximately $650 million. At March 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, there was $10.3 million outstanding, net of approximately $0.5 million of debt issuance costs. As of March 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the interest rate was 7.86% and 7.69%, respectively. At March 31, 2023, all of the trust preferred\nsecurities qualified as Tier 1 capital.\nOn January 20, 2017, Primis completed the sale of $27.0 million of its fixed-to-floating rate senior Subordinated Notes due\n2027. Interest is currently payable at an annual floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of 3.95% until\nmaturity or early redemption. At March 31, 2023, 60% of these notes qualified as Tier 2 capital.\nOn August 25, 2020, Primis completed the sale of $60.0 million of its fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due 2030.\nInterest is payable at an initial annual fixed rate of 5.40% and after September 1, 2025, at a floating rate equal to a benchmark\nrate, which is expected to be Three-Month Term SOFR, plus a spread of 531 basis points. At March 31, 2023, all of these\nnotes qualified as Tier 2 capital.\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior\nSubordinated Notes totaled $1.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\nSecured Borrowings\nThe Company transferred $15.1 million in principal balance of loans to another financial institution during the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023 that were accounted for as secured borrowings. The balance of secured borrowings was $15.0\nmillion as of March 31, 2023 and the remaining amortized cost balance of the underlying loans was $15.1 million. None of the\nloans underlying the secured borrowings were past due 30 days or greater or on nonaccrual as of March 31, 2023 and were all\ninternally rated as \"pass\" loans as presented in our \"credit quality indicators\" section of Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for\nCredit Losses. The loans were included in our allowance for credit losses process and an allowance was calculated on the\nloans as part of their inclusion in a pool with other loans with similar credit risk characteristics. There were no charge - offs of\nthe loans underlying the secured borrowings during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The underlying loans\ncollateralize the borrowings and cannot be sold or pledged by the Company.\n8. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe 2017 Equity Compensation Plan (the “2017 Plan”) has a maximum number of 750,000 shares reserved for issuance.\nThe purpose of the 2017 Plan is to promote the success of the Company by providing greater incentives to employees, non-\nemployee directors, consultants and advisors to associate their personal financial interests with the long-term financial success\nof the Company, including its subsidiaries, and with growth in stockholder value, consistent with the Company’s risk\nmanagement practices.\n33\nTable of Contents\nA summary of stock option activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023 follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average Aggregate\nAverage Remaining Intrinsic\nExercise Contractual Value\nShares Price Term (in thousands)\nOptions outstanding, beginning of period 203,300 $ 11.41 1.3 $ 102\nExpired (12,000)\nExercised (8,000)\nOptions outstanding, end of period 183,300 $ 11.47 1.1 $ 4\nExercisable at end of period 183,300 $ 11.47 1.1464 4\nThere was no stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options for the three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022. As of March 31, 2023, we do not have any unrecognized compensation expense associated with the stock options.\nA summary of time vested restricted stock awards for the three months ended March 31, 2023 follows:\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nGrant-Date Remaining\nFair Value Contractual\nShares Per Share Term\nUnvested restricted stock outstanding, beginning of period 68,700 $ 14.24 2.4\nVested (17,850) 15.12\nForfeited (2,000) 15.43\nUnvested restricted stock outstanding, end of period 48,850 $ 13.87 2.3\nStock-based compensation expense for time vested restricted stock awards totaled $0.1 million and $0.8 million for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, unrecognized compensation expense\nassociated with restricted stock awards was $0.6 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period\nof 2.3 years.\nA summary of performance-based restricted stock units (the “Units”) for the three months ended March 31, 2023 follows:\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nGrant-Date Remaining\nFair Value Contractual\nShares Per Share Term\nUnvested Units outstanding, beginning of period 153,960 $ 13.02 3.6\nGranted — —\nVested — —\nUnvested Units outstanding, end of period 153,960 $ 13.02 2.9\nThese Units are subject to service and performance conditions. These Units vest based on the achievement of both\nconditions. Achievement of the performance condition will be determined at the end of the five-year performance period (the\n“Performance Period”) by evaluating the: 1) Company’s adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth measured for\nthe Performance Period and 2) performance factor achieved. Payouts between performance levels will be determined based on\nstraight line interpolation.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe Company did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense associated with these Units for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022 because it is not probable that these Units will vest. The potential unrecognized compensation\nexpense associated with these Units was $3.0 million and $1.3 million, at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Restated)\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nPrimis is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing\nneeds of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and\nguarantees of credit card accounts. These instruments involve elements of credit and funding risk in excess of the amount\nrecognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by Primis to\nguarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the\nsame as that involved in extending loans to customers. We had letters of credit outstanding totaling $11.1 million and $10.7\nmillion as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nOur exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments\nto extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the same credit policies in\nmaking commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless noted otherwise, we do\nnot require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with\nASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting\nfrom a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the\nobligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines of credit and\nletters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers both the likelihood\nthat funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the commitment or other\noff-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical utilization rates. The\namount of the allowance represents management's best estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be\nfunded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts expected to be funded uses the same\nmethodology as described for loans in Note 3 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses, as if such commitments were funded.\nThe allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is reflected in other liabilities in our consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nThe following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures:\n2023 2022\nBalance as of January 1 $ 1,416 $ 977\nCredit loss expense 98 260\nBalance as of March 31, $ 1,514 $ 1,237\nCommitments\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition\nestablished in the contract. Commitments are made predominately for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed\nexpiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually require payment of a fee. Since many of the\ncommitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent\nfuture cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.\nWe had $67.5 million of loan commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2023, all of which contractually expire within\nthirty years.\n35\nTable of Contents\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds\ntotaling $526.3 million and $540.6 million, respectively, not all of which will ultimately be drawn. Virtually all of our\nunfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds are variable rate. The amount of certificate of deposit\naccounts maturing in less than one year was $380.3 million as of March 31, 2023, including $100.0 million of brokered CDs.\nManagement anticipates that funding requirements for these commitments can be met in the normal course.\nPrimis also had commitments on the subscription agreements entered into for investments in non-marketable equity\nsecurities of $3.0 million and $3.2 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n10.

SEGMENT INFORMATION (Restated)\nThe Company's management reporting process measures the performance of its operating segment based on internal\noperating structure, which is subject to change from time to time. Accordingly, the Company operates two reportable segments\nfor management reporting purposes as discussed below:\nPrimis Bank. This segment specializes in providing financing services to businesses in various industries and deposit-\nrelated services to businesses, consumers and other customers. The primary source of revenue for this segment is net interest\nincome from the origination of loans.\nPrimis Mortgage. This segment specializes in originating mortgages in a majority of the U.S. The primary source of\nrevenue for this segment is noninterest income and the origination and sale of mortgage loans.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022, we operated as one reportable segment.\nThe following table provides financial information for the Company's reportable segments. The information provided\nunder the caption “Primis Bank” includes operations not considered to be reportable segments and/or general operating\nexpenses of the Company, and includes the parent company and elimination adjustments to reconcile the results of the\noperating segment to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.\nAs of and for the year ended March 31, 2023\nPrimis Mortgage Primis Bank Consolidated\nInterest income $ 396 $ 43,862 $ 44,258\nInterest expense — 18,936 18,936\nNet interest income 396 24,926 25,322\nProvision for loan losses — 5,263 5,263\nNoninterest income 4,315 13,355 17,670\nNoninterest expense 4,988 21,966 26,954\nIncome before income taxes (277) 11,052 10,775\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (65) 2,477 2,412\nNet income (loss) $ (212) $ 8,575 $ 8,363\nAssets $ 46,877 $ 4,172,105 $ 4,218,982\n37\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS (Revised and Restated)\nManagement’s discussion and analysis is presented to aid the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial\ncondition and results of operations of Primis.

(“Primis,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is the bank holding company for Primis Bank\n(“Primis Bank” or the “Bank”), a Virginia state-chartered bank which commenced operations on April 14, 2005. Primis Bank\nprovides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses. At March 31, 2023, Primis Bank\nhad thirty-two full-service branches in Virginia and Maryland and also provides services to customers through certain online\nand mobile applications. Thirty full-service retail branches are in Virginia and two full-service retail branches are in Maryland.\nThe Company is headquartered in McLean, Virginia and has administrative offices in Tysons Corner, Virginia and Glen Allen,\nVirginia and an operations center in Atlee, Virginia. Our deposits are insured, up to applicable limits, by the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (the “FDIC”). Primis Bank also owns Primis Mortgage Company, a residential mortgage lender.\nWhile Primis Bank offers a wide range of commercial banking services, it focuses on making loans secured primarily by\ncommercial real estate and other types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a\nnumber of industries, as well as loans to individuals for a variety of purposes. Primis Bank invests in real estate-related\nsecurities, including collateralized mortgage obligations and agency mortgage backed securities. Primis Bank’s principal\nsources of funds for loans and investing in securities are deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings. Primis Bank offers a\nbroad range of deposit products, including checking (NOW), savings, money market accounts and certificates of deposit.\nPrimis Bank actively pursues business relationships by utilizing the business contacts of its senior management, other bank\nofficers and its directors, thereby capitalizing on its knowledge of its local market areas.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT\nThe U.S. economy expanded in the first quarter of 2023, with Real Gross Domestic Product growing by an annualized\n1.1%. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the rate of unemployment dropped to 3.5% in March 2023. The\nFederal Reserve (the “Fed”) has raised rates 500 bps since March of 2022 in an effort to temper inflation, a pace that has not\nbeen experienced in more than 40 years and now sits at a level not seen since 2006. This rate level is putting strong upward\npressure on all banks including Primis’ cost of deposits as banks look for ways to increase liquidity. Inflation remains higher\nthan the Fed’s long term target rate of 2%, and weakness in some areas of the economy and turmoil in the banking system has\nheightened recessionary concerns.\n41\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Revised and Restated)\n● Net income of $8.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, or $0.34 basic and diluted earnings per\nshare, compared to $4.5 million, or $0.18 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended March 31,\n2022.\n● Total assets as of March 31, 2023 were $4.2 billion, an increase of 18% compared to December 31, 2022.\n● Total cash and cash equivalents grew to $607.1 million, up from $77.9 million at December 31, 2022.\n● Total loans, excluding Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) balances as of March 31, 2023, were $3.1 billion, an\nincrease of $111 million, or 3.78%, from December 31, 2022.\n● Total deposits were $3.7 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of 35% compared to December 31, 2022.\n● Non-time deposits increased to $3.2 billion at March 31, 2023, an increase of $912.2 million, or 40%, compared to\nDecember 31, 2022.\n● The ratio of gross loans to deposits has declined to 82% at March 31, 2023, from 108% at December 31, 2022.\n● Net interest margin of 2.81% in the first quarter of 2023 was down from 2.96% in the first quarter of 2022.\n● Allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.17% at March 31, 2023, compared to 1.17% at December 31, 2022.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Revised and Restated)\nNet Income\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $8.4 million, or $0.34 basic and diluted earnings per share,\ncompared to $4.5 million, or $0.18 basic and diluted earnings per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The 85%\nincrease in net income during the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022\nwas driven by Consumer Program derivative income, higher mortgage banking income, and an increase in net interest income\nin the first quarter of 2023. These increases were partially offset by higher noninterest expenses mainly from an increase in\nemployee compensation and benefits expense in the first quarter of 2023 related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis\nMortgage and Panacea and higher provision for credit losses.\nNet Interest Income\nOur operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend\nincome on interest-earning assets such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as\ndeposits and borrowings.\nNet interest income was $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $22.8 million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022. Primis’ net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was 2.81%, compared\nto 2.96% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Net interest margin was significantly impacted by the successful launch\nof the Bank’s digital deposit platform along with increased competition in the Company’s core banking markets which\nincreased the cost of deposits in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. Total income on interest-\nearning assets was $44.3 million and $26.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nyield on average interest-earning assets was 4.92% and 3.44% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Increase in yield on average interest-earnings assets was driven by higher rates on cash and loans in the first\nquarter of 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities was $2.9 billion compared to $2.4 billion for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The cost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 188 basis points to 2.32% for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 0.44% cost on average interest-bearing deposits for the three months\nended March 31, 2022. This increase was driven by the benchmark interest rate increases which in turn drove the increase in\ninterest-bearing deposit pricing. Average rates on our interest-bearing deposits increased in all categories but the largest\nincreases were seen in money market, savings, and time deposits which also had an aggregate increase in average balances of\n$523 million year-over-year. This was a primary driven in the interest rate spread decreasing to 2.28% for the three months\nended March 31, 2023 from 2.80% for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe following table details average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of\ninterest earned/paid on such assets and liabilities, and the yield/rate for the periods indicated:\nAverage Balance Sheets and Net Interest\nAnalysis For the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2023 March 31, 2022\nInterest Interest\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/\nBalance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nAssets\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans held for sale $ 25,346 $ 391 6.26% $ — $ — —%\nLoans, net of deferred fees (1) (2) 2,989,925 38,059 5.16% 2,358,674 $ 24,701 4.25%\nInvestment securities 246,402 1,584 2.61% 302,431 1,430 1.92%\nOther earning assets 388,327 4,224 4.41% 466,952 406 0.35%\nTotal earning assets 3,650,000 44,258 4.92% 3,128,057 26,537 3.44%\nAllowance for credit losses (34,099) (29,238)\nInvestments in mortgage affiliate - held for sale — —\nTotal non-earning assets 284,339 255,900\nTotal assets $ 3,900,240 $ 3,354,719\nLiabilities and stockholders' equity\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nNOW and other demand accounts $ 722,583 $ 2,267 1.27% $ 817,430 $ 666 0.33%\nMoney market accounts 824,541 4,801 2.36% 809,460 858 0.43%\nSavings accounts 593,896 4,750 3.24% 224,789 149 0.27%\nTime deposits 489,066 3,226 2.68% 350,368 700 0.81%\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,630,086 15,044 2.32% 2,202,047 2,373 0.44%\nBorrowings 285,113 3,892 5.54% 171,293 1,371 3.25%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 2,915,199 18,936 2.63% 2,373,340 3,744 0.64%\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand deposits 556,495 545,530\nOther liabilities 28,545 23,059\nTotal liabilities 3,500,239 2,941,929\nStockholders' equity 400,002 412,790\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 3,900,241 $ 3,354,719\nNet interest income $ 25,322 $ 22,793\nInterest rate spread 2.28% 2.80%\nNet interest margin 2.81% 2.96%\n(1) Includes loan fees in both interest income and the calculation of the yield on loans.\n(2) Calculations include non-accruing loans in average loan amounts outstanding.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses is a current charge to earnings made in order to adjust the allowance for credit losses to an\nappropriate level for current expected losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio, current\neconomic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of lending, historical loan experience and other known internal and\nexternal factors affecting loan collectability. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated by segmenting the loan portfolio by\nloan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined by considering historical loss data, peer\ndata, as well as applying management’s judgment.\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 of $5.3 million\nand $0.1 million, respectively. Of this provision in the first quarter of 2023, $4.8 million was due to charge-offs and additional\nreserve calculated in our normal reserve process related to the Consumer Program loans. Excluding this provision amount, the\nprovision for credit losses would have been $0.5 million at March 31, 2023. We had charge-offs totaling $4.4 million and $0.1\nmillion during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Charge-offs\n43\nTable of Contents\nrelated to the Consumer Program loans were $2.0 million and $100 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. There were recoveries totaling $0.4 million and $0.2 million during the three months ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Financial Condition Section of this MD&A provides information on our loan portfolio, past due loans, nonperforming\nassets and the allowance for credit losses.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents the major categories of noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and\n2022:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nAccount maintenance and deposit service fees $ 1,224 $ 1,351 $ (127)\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance 420 375 45\n(Loss) gain on other investments (39) 195 (234)\nMortgage banking income 4,315 — 4,315\nGain on sale of loans 51 — 51\nConsumer Program derivative 11,443 54 11,389\nOther noninterest income 256 170 86\nTotal noninterest income $ 17,670 $ 2,145 $ 15,525\nNoninterest income increased 724% to $17.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $2.1\nmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in noninterest income was primarily related to $11.4 million\nof income on the Consumer Program derivative and $4.3 million of mortgage banking income in the first quarter of 2023. The\nConsumer Program derivative income was comprised of $10.5 million of fair value adjustment gains and $0.9 million of\nincome related to credit loss reimbursements from the derivative counterparty under the Consumer Program agreement. The\nincrease in mortgage banking income was a result of our purchase of Primis Mortgage in May 2022 and the normal mortgage\nactivities now reflected in our income statement during the first quarter of 2023, which included the fair value adjustments and\ngains on sales of mortgage loans held for sale.\n44\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents the major categories of noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and\n2022:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nSalaries and benefits $ 15,028 $ 9,625 $ 5,403\nOccupancy expenses 1,445 1,457 (12)\nFurniture and equipment expenses 1,577 1,100 477\nAmortization of core deposit intangible 317 341 (24)\nVirginia franchise tax expense 849 813 36\nData processing expense 2,251 1,490 761\nMarketing expense 569 465 104\nTelephone and communication expense 377 382 (5)\nNet (gain) loss on other real estate owned — (59) 59\nProfessional fees 862 1,094 (232)\nMiscellaneous lending expenses 885 390 495\nOther operating expenses 2,794 1,955 839\nTotal noninterest expenses $ 26,954 $ 19,053 $ 7,901\nNoninterest expenses were $27.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to $19.1 million\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2022. The 41% increase in noninterest expenses was primarily due to a $5.4 million\nincrease in employee compensation in the first quarter of 2023 related to increased head count at the Bank, Primis Mortgage\nand Panacea compared to 2022. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was also\nattributable to a $0.8 million increase in data processing expense driven by substantially higher application volume on the\ndigital deposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during the quarter. A significant driver of the\nincrease in other operating expenses were higher expenses related to Primis Mortgage in the first quarter of 2023. Other\nnotable drivers of the increase in other operating expenses in the quarter include higher FDIC insurance costs and increased\nfraud losses, primarily driven by increased check fraud activity. Increases in noninterest expense were offset by a decline in\nprofessional fees due to expenses associated with bringing certain V1BE activities in-house in the first quarter of 2022.\n45\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL CONDITION (Revised and Restated)\nBalance Sheet Overview\nTotal assets were $4.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 and $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2022.

Despite this economic uncertainty,\nour asset quality remained strong during the first quarter of 2023. We will generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it\nbecomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the\nborrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as\nnonaccrual will be recorded as a reduction of principal as long as doubt exists as to future collections.\nWe maintain appraisals on loans secured by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential\nproblem loans. In instances where appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the borrower’s\noverall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If foreclosure\noccurs, we record OREO at the lower of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated costs to sell.\nOur loan portfolio losses and delinquencies have been primarily limited by our underwriting standards and portfolio\nmanagement practices. Whether losses and delinquencies in our portfolio will increase significantly depends upon the value of\nthe real estate securing the loans and economic factors, such as the overall economy in our market area, rising interest rates,\nhistorically high inflation, global supply chain issues and potential recession.\nTotal calculated reserves increased by $1.3 million to $35.8 million at the end of March 31, 2023 compared to $34.5\nmillion at December 31, 2022, primarily due to the $109.2 million in total loan growth experienced in the first quarter of 2023.\nThe following table presents a comparison of nonperforming assets as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (in\nthousands):\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNonaccrual loans $ 33,397 $ 35,484\nLoans past due 90 days and accruing interest 1,625 3,361\nTotal nonperforming assets 35,022 38,845\nSBA guaranteed amounts included in nonperforming loans $ 2,206 $ 3,969\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans 1.17% 1.17%\nAllowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 107.20% 97.35%\nAllowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 102.23% 88.93%\nNonaccrual to total loans 1.10% 1.20%\nNonperforming assets excluding SBA guaranteed loans to total assets 0.78% 0.98%\n48\nTable of Contents\nNonaccrual loans were $33.4 million (excluding $0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at March 31,\n2023, compared to $35.5 million (excluding $0.6 million of loans fully covered by SBA guarantees) at December 31, 2022, a\ndecrease of 6%. A substantial portion of the Bank’s nonperforming assets are comprised of two relationships with a combined\nbalance of approximately $27.0 million. A large residential property with a balance of approximately $8.0 million included in\nthat total, continues to make sporadic payments and is current as of March 31, 2023. The other relationship, primarily\nconsisting of assisted living facilities, is currently in the middle of a receiver-managed marketing process.\nAt March 31, 2023, our total substandard loans were $39.5 million. Included in the total substandard loans were SBA\nguarantees of $0.8 million. Special mention loans totaled $28.3 million at March 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, our total\nsubstandard loans was $41.0 million. Included in the total substandard loans were SBA guarantees of $0.8 million. Special\nmention loans totaled $32.3 million at December 31, 2022.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2023, one loan from our residential 1-4 family loan portfolio on an amortized cost basis\nof $0.9 million, was modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. This modification allowed a six month deferral\nof principal and interest of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, with contractual payments expected to\nresume in August of this year. This loan, which has had no payment delinquencies since origination, represents only 0.15% of\ntotal loans in the secured by first liens pool.\n49\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Securities\nOur investment securities portfolio provides us with required liquidity and investment securities to pledge as collateral to\nsecure public deposits, certain other deposits, advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, and repurchase agreements.\nWe classify our investment securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Debt investment securities that Primis\nhas the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost.\nInvestment securities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes in\ninterest rates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with\nunrealized gains or losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’\nequity.\nInvestment securities, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled $244.6 million at March 31, 2023, a decrease of 2%\nfrom $249.8 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated. Available-for-sale\ninvestment securities are reported at fair value, and held-to-maturity investment securities are reported at amortized cost (in\nthousands).\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities:\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities $ 101,917 $ 102,881\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 30,000 29,178\nCorporate securities 14,078 14,828\nCollateralized loan obligations 4,891 4,876\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 25,635 26,595\nGovernment-sponsored agency securities 15,100 14,616\nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities 34,597 37,417\nSBA pool securities 5,250 5,924\nTotal $ 231,468 $ 236,315\nHeld-to-maturity investment securities:\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities $ 10,146 $ 10,522\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 2,722 2,721\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations 247 277\nTotal $ 13,115 $ 13,520\nWe recognized an immaterial amount of credit impairment charges related to credit losses on our held-to-maturity\ninvestment securities during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and no credit losses during the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2022.\nDeposits and Other Borrowings\nDeposits\nThe market for deposits is competitive. We offer a line of traditional deposit products that currently include noninterest-\nbearing and interest-bearing checking (or NOW accounts), commercial checking, money market accounts, savings accounts\nand certificates of deposit. We compete for deposits through our banking branches with competitive pricing, advertising and\nonline banking. We use deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending, purchasing of investment securities and for\nother business purposes.\nTotal deposits increased 35% to $3.7 billion at March 31, 2023 from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in\ndeposits from year-end was primarily driven by the substantial growth in the Bank’s new digital deposit platform in the\n50\nTable of Contents\nfirst quarter of 2023. The majority of the growth was in savings accounts with the remainder largely in NOW accounts.\nSavings accounts increased 295% from $245.8 million as of December 31, 2022 to $971.5 million at March 31, 2023. NOW\naccounts increased 35% from $617.7 million at December 31, 2022 to $835.3 million at March 31, 2023. Our deposits are\ndiversified in type and by underlying customer and lack significant concentrations to any type of customer (i.e. commercial,\nconsumer, government) or industry.\nUninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit and\namounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any federal\nor state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance were $1.1 billion, or 31% of\ntotal deposits at March 31, 2023. Included in this amount are affiliate balances and collateralized deposits of public entities\nand state and local government agencies; adjusting for these categories, our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits are\napproximately 26% of our total deposits at March 31, 2023.\nThe variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and in responding to the threat of\ndisintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as banking institutions into direct investment\nvehicles such as government and corporate securities). Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the effect of such\nretention on our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by the general economy and market\nrates of interest.\nFor our deposit agreements with certain customers, we hold the collateral in a segregated custodial account. We are\nrequired to maintain adequate collateral levels. In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, we will\npledge additional securities. We closely monitor collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained, while mitigating\nthe potential risk of over-collateralization.\nOther Borrowings\nWe use other borrowed funds to support our liquidity needs and to temporarily satisfy our funding needs from increased\nloan demand and for other shorter term purposes. We are a member of the FHLB and are authorized to obtain advances from\nthe FHLB from time to time as needed. The FHLB has a credit program for members with different maturities and interest\nrates, which may be fixed or variable. We are required to collateralize our borrowings from the FHLB with purchases of\nFHLB stock and other collateral acceptable to the FHLB. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, total FHLB\nborrowings were $0 and $325.0 million, respectively. The decrease in FHLB borrowings was a result of the deposit growth\nduring the first quarter of 2023 that primarily funded our loan growth and supported other funding needs and allowing us to\nrepay our FHLB advances. As of March 31, 2023, we had $541.6 million of unused and available FHLB lines of credit.\nOther borrowings can consist of federal funds purchased, secured borrowings due to failed loan sales, and securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase (“repo”) that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The\nbalance in repo accounts was $4.3 million and $6.4 million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nWe had secured borrowings of $15.0 million as of March 31, 2023 related to loan transfers to another financial institution\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2023 that did not meet the criteria to be treated as a sale under relevant accounting\nguidance. These borrowings reflect the cash received for transferring the loans to the other financial institution and any\nunamortized sale premium and are secured by approximately the same amount of loans held for investment that are recorded\nin our balance sheet. We retained the servicing of the loans that were transferred and accordingly receive principal and interest\nfrom the borrower as contractually required and transfer the interest to the other financial institution net of our contractually\nagreed upon servicing fee. The loans transferred have an average maturity of approximately ten years which will be the time\nover which the principal balance of the loans in our balance sheet and secured borrowings will pay down, absent borrower\nprepayments. For additional information on secured borrowings refer to “Note 1 –Accounting Policies” in this Form 10-Q/A.\n51\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Funds Management\nThe objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations\ninclude the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity, the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund\ncommitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding from a variety of sources, including customer deposit\naccounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and investments. If our level of core deposits are not\nsufficient to fully fund our lending activities, we have access to funding from additional sources, including but not limited to\nborrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and institutional certificates of deposits. In addition, we maintain\nfederal funds lines of credit with two correspondent banks, totaling $65 million, and utilize securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase (“repo”) and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers, as needed.\nWe prepare a cash flow forecast on a 30, 60 and 90 day basis along with a one and two year basis. These projections\nincorporate expected cash flows on loans, investment securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest rate\nrisk analyses.\nAt March 31, 2023, we had substantial liquidity on the balance sheet with cash and equivalents of $607 million versus $78\nmillion at December 31, 2022 largely due to the growth in digital platform deposits described above.\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had pledged callable agency securities, residential government-sponsored\nmortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with a carrying value of $13.9 million and $14.2 million,\nrespectively, to customers who require collateral for overnight repurchase agreements and deposits.\nThe balance in repo accounts at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $4.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nWe repaid our short-term FHLB advances of $325.0 million that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and matured\nin the first quarter of 2023. As a result, we have all of our FHLB capacity available for future liquidity needs. At March 31,\n2023, Primis Bank had lendable collateral value in the form of residential 1-4 family mortgages, HELOCs, commercial\nmortgage loans, and investment securities supporting borrowing capacity of approximately $541.6 million from the FHLB.\nIn March 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) in response to recent industry\ndisruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to eligible depository institutions in exchange for pledged collateral\nin the form of U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets. Borrowing capacity\nunder the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of the collateral. At March 31, 2023, we had securities available of\n$165.0 million for utilization with the BTFP, with no borrowings outstanding under the program at March 31, 2023.\nThe Bank also utilizes institutional and brokered certificates of deposit to supplement customer funding. At March 31,\n2023, we had $100.0 million of brokered deposits outstanding. We had remaining brokered CD capacity under internal policy\nof approximately $321.0 million.\nAt March 31, 2023, we had $526.3 million of unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds, not all of\nwhich will ultimately be drawn. The amount of certificate of deposit accounts maturing in less than one year was $380.3\nmillion as of March 31, 2023, including $100.0 million of brokered CDs. Management anticipates that funding requirements\nfor these commitments can be met in the normal course.\nAs noted above, our uninsured and otherwise uncollateralized deposits were approximately 26% of total deposits, or\n$946.0 million. The combined availability under our various liquidity sources along with cash and equivalents on the balance\nsheet represented approximately 180% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits at March 31, 2023.\n52\nTable of Contents\nAs of March 31, 2023, Primis was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have or are reasonably\nlikely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of March 31, 2023, Primis has no material commitments for capital\nexpenditures.\nCapital Resources\nCapital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations. Primis Financial Corp. and\nits subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure\nto meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by\nregulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy\nguidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (“PCA”), we must meet specific capital guidelines that\ninvolve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory\naccounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about\ncomponents, risk weightings and other factors. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the most recent regulatory\nnotifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Primis to maintain minimum amounts\nand ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of\nMarch 31, 2023, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios of Primis Financial Corp. and\nPrimis Bank at the periods indicated to the minimum and well-capitalized required regulatory standards:\nMinimum\nRequired for\nCapital To Be Actual Ratio at\nAdequacy Categorized as March 31, December 31,\nPurposes Well Capitalized (1) 2023 2022\nPrimis Financial Corp.\nLeverage ratio 4.00% n/a 8.53% 9.52%\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 4.50% n/a 9.86% 10.07%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 6.00% n/a 10.18% 10.40%\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 8.00% n/a 13.99% 14.33%\nPrimis Bank\nLeverage ratio 4.00% 5.00% 10.15% 11.24%\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 7.00% 6.50% 12.18% 12.40%\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 8.50% 8.00% 12.18% 12.40%\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 10.50% 10.00% 13.37% 13.59%\n(1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level.\nPrimis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory\nauthorities. Bank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines (“Basel III”) aimed at strengthening existing\ncapital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank to\nmaintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% “capital\nconservation buffer”, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital\nconservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation\nbuffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions\nby regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nPrimis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had a\ncapital conservation buffer of 5.37% at March 31, 2023, which exceeded the 2.50% minimum requirement below which the\nregulators may impose limits on distributions.\n53\nTable of Contents\nPrimis Bank’s capital position is consistent with being well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for PCA.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Restated)\nThe critical accounting policies are discussed in MD&A in our restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting\npronouncements are discussed in “Note 1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” in Form 10-K/A for the year\nended December 31, 2022. Disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in “Note 1.\nAccounting Policies” in this Form 10-Q/A. There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies during 2023.\nITEM 3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Revised and Restated)\nWe are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-earning\nloans and investments. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which is the\ndifference between the interest income on loans and other investments and the interest expense on deposits and borrowings. To\nthe extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-earning assets, we are\nsubject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. Our Asset-Liability Committee (“ALCO”)\nmeets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and\nlimit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed and approved by our Board of\nDirectors. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our net interest income, without having\nto incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk.\nWe use simulation modeling to manage our interest rate risk, and review quarterly interest sensitivity. This approach uses a\nmodel which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity (“EVE”) over a range of interest rate\nscenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts using\nassumptions including estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates.\nThe following tables are based on an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE\nresulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 100 basis points,\nmeasured in 100 basis point increments) as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. All changes are within our\nAsset/Liability Risk Management Policy guidelines.\nSensitivity of Economic Value of Equity\nAs of March 31, 2023\nEconomic Value of\nEconomic Value of Equity Equity as a % of\nChange in Interest Rates $ Change % Change Total Equity\nin Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base From Base Assets Book Value\n(dollar amounts in thousands)\nUp 400 $ 345,671 $ (26,491) (7.12)% 8.19% 86.98%\nUp 300 351,887 (20,275) (5.45)% 8.34% 88.54%\nUp 200 357,100 (15,062) (4.05)% 8.46% 89.86%\nUp 100 371,689 (473) (0.13)% 8.81% 93.53%\nBase 372,162 — —% 8.82% 93.64%\nDown 100 356,560 (15,602) (4.19)% 8.45% 89.72%\nDown 200 322,713 (49,449) (13.29)% 7.65% 81.20%\n54\nTable of Contents\nSensitivity of Economic Value of Equity\nAs of December 31, 2022\nEconomic Value of\nEconomic Value of Equity Equity as a % of\nChange in Interest Rates $ Change % Change Total Equity\nin Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base From Base Assets Book Value\n(dollar amounts in thousands)\nUp 400 $ 481,135 $ (63,410) (11.64)% 13.49% 123.70%\nUp 300 496,136 (48,409) (8.89)% 13.91% 127.55%\nUp 200 510,807 (33,738) (6.20)% 14.32% 131.32%\nUp 100 534,163 (10,382) (1.91)% 14.98% 137.33%\nBase 544,545 — —% 15.27% 140.00%\nDown 100 539,297 (5,248) (0.96)% 15.12% 138.65%\nOur interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model that generates estimates of the\nchange in the net interest income (“NII”) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NII depends upon the relative amounts of\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the model\nassumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nremains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected\nuniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All\nchanges are within our ALM Policy guidelines at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nSensitivity of Net Interest Income\nAs of March 31, 2023\nAdjusted Net Interest Income\nChange in Interest Rates $ Change\nin Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base\n(dollar amounts in thousands)\nUp 400 $ 99,957 $ (10,338)\nUp 300 102,031 (8,264)\nUp 200 104,100 (6,195)\nUp 100 107,705 (2,590)\nBase 110,295 —\nDown 100 111,317 1,022\nDown 200 110,329 34\nSensitivity of Net Interest Income\nAs of December 31, 2022\nAdjusted Net Interest Income\nChange in Interest Rates $ Change\nin Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base\n(dollar amounts in thousands)\nUp 400 $ 108,514 $ (12,447)\nUp 300 111,127 (9,834)\nUp 200 113,730 (7,231)\nUp 100 117,811 (3,150)\nBase 120,961 —\nDown 100 122,070 1,109\nDown 200 120,687 (274)\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling\nchanges in EVE and NII sensitivity requires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in\nwhich actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE tables and NII tables\nprovide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to,\nand do not, provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net worth and NII. Sensitivity of\nEVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions and approaches.\n55\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (Restated)\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other\nprocedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), we have\nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) utilizing the framework established in “Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based\nupon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are not effective as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. This conclusion was reached as a result of the continued\nremediation of previously identified material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting as further described in\nItem 9A in the restated 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K/A related to complex accounting arrangements and also due to the\nidentification of an additional material weakness related to the transfer of certain loans to another financial institution during\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023.\nManagement identified the additional material weakness over the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023 related to accounting determinations for transfers of financial assets including lack of\na formally designed process and procedure for evaluation of loan transfers. The existing procedures did not outline the process\nto be taken and individuals to be involved in assessment of the proper accounting for loan transfers and were not sufficient\nenough to facilitate a proper conclusion on loan transfer transactions.\nAs required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Amendment. The Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures were not effective as of March 31, 2023, at the reasonable assurance level, because of the material weakness in\ninternal controls, which were disclosed in the Company's restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 (with respect to the Consumer Program) and Current Report on Form 8-K on March 1, 2024 (with respect\nto the loan transfers). Notwithstanding the material weaknesses, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO,\nhas concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in the Form 10-Q/A, for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash-\nflows for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\nRemediation Plans\n(i) Complex accounting arrangements\nManagement continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including\nimplementing additional internal controls over the identification of complex agreements the Company enters into and ensuring\nthe appropriate level of review of these agreements by an individual with the requisite accounting expertise. The Company is\nadding additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of internal controls\nover financial reporting to require appropriate levels of accounting management review of new transactions. Additionally, the\nCompany will seek appropriate third-party accounting expertise when it determines a transaction contains complex\narrangements that management does not have sufficient expertise to assess and conclude upon. The material weakness will not\nbe considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made\nprogress in the remediation efforts related to the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated as\nsoon as possible.\n56\nTable of Contents\n(ii) Loan transfers\nManagement continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including\nimplementing additional internal controls over the identification of loan transfer transactions and management review of the\ntransactions. The Company has added additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the\neffectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the\napplicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made progress in the remediation efforts related\nto the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated as soon as possible.\nThe Company’s remediation efforts include:\n● created a specific control in its quarterly financial close process to facilitate the identification of loan transfers\nand trigger an accounting review;\n● created a process to assess loan transfers in accordance with applicable accounting guidance;\n● established procedures to enable the accounting assessment in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and\n● developed criteria that facilitates the decision process for use of outside legal counsel to assist in evaluating the\nlegal isolation requirement.\nThe Company’s actions are subject to ongoing executive management review and are also subject to audit committee\noversight. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate the material weakness, or if in the future, the Company\nidentifies further material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not detect errors on a\ntimely basis, and its condensed consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Management may determine\nthat additional measures are required to address control deficiencies, strengthen internal control over financial reporting, or it\nmay determine to modify the remediation measures described above.\n(b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. As a result of the acquisition of Primis Mortgage, the Company\nis continuously working to integrate Primis Mortgage into its internal control over financial reporting process. Except for the\nchanges in connection with this integration of Primis Mortgage and the material weaknesses noted above, there were no\nchanges in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nPrimis and Primis Bank are from time to time a party, as both plaintiff and defendant, to various claims and proceedings\narising in the ordinary course of the Bank’s business, including administrative and/or legal proceedings that may include\nemployment-related claims, as well as claims of lender liability, breach of contract, and other similar lending-related claims.\nWhile the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be determined at this time, the Bank’s management presently believes\nthat such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial condition\nor results of operations. There are no proceedings pending, or to management’s knowledge, threatened, that represent a\nsignificant risk against Primis or Primis Bank as of March 31, 2023.\nITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS (Restated)\nThere were no changes to the risk factors that were previously disclosed in our restated Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, except for the addition of the item below.\nRecent negative developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations\nand our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe recent bank failures and related negative media attention have generated significant market trading volatility among\npublicly traded bank holding companies and, in particular, regional, as well as community banks like the Company.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThese developments have negatively impacted customer confidence in regional and community banks, which could prompt\ncustomers to maintain their deposits with larger financial institutions. Further, competition for deposits has increased in recent\nperiods, and the cost of funding has similarly increased, putting pressure on our net interest margin. If we were required to sell\na portion of our securities portfolio to address liquidity needs, we may incur losses, including as a result of the negative impact\nof rising interest rates on the value of our securities portfolio, which could negatively affect our earnings and our capital. If we\nwere required to raise additional capital in the current environment, any such capital raise may be on unfavorable terms,\nthereby negatively impacting book value and profitability. While we have taken actions to improve our funding, there is no\nguarantee that such actions will be successful or sufficient in the event of sudden liquidity needs.\nWe also anticipate increased regulatory scrutiny – in the course of routine examinations and otherwise – and new\nregulations directed towards banks of similar size to Primis Bank, designed to address the recent negative developments in the\nbanking industry, all of which may increase our costs of doing business and reduce our profitability. Among other things, there\nmay be an increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition, the level of uninsured deposits, losses\nembedded in the held-to-maturity portion of our securities portfolio, contingent liquidity, CRE composition and concentration,\ncapital position and our general oversight and internal control structures regarding the foregoing. As a result, Primis Bank\ncould face increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators and the investor community.\n58\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2 – UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 3 – DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4 – MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5 – OTHER INFORMATION\nNot applicable.\n59\nTable of Contents\nITEM 6 – EXHIBITS (Restated)\n(a) Exhibits.\nExhibit No. Description\n3.1 Articles of Incorporation (incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 3.1 to Primis Financial Corp.’s\n(formerly Southern National’s) Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-136285) filed\nAugust 4, 2006)\n3.2 Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation dated January 31, 2005 (incorporated herein by\nreference to Exhibit 3.2 to Primis Financial Corp.’s (formerly Southern National’s) Registration Statement on\nForm S-1 (Registration No. 333-136285) filed on August 4, 2006)\n3.3 Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation dated April 13, 2006 (incorporated herein by\nreference to Exhibit 3.3 to Primis Financial Corp.’s (formerly Southern National’s) Registration Statement on\nForm S-1 (Registration No. 333-136285) filed on August 4, 2006)\n3.4 Articles of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation dated March 31, 2021 (incorporated herein by\nreference to Exhibit 3.1 to Primis Financial Corp.’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 31, 2021)\n3.5 Amended and Restated Bylaws (incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 3.2 to Primis Financial Corp.’s\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed on March 31, 2021)\n31.1* Certification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n31.2* Certification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n32.1** Certification of Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002.\n101 The following materials from Primis Financial Corp.

Business\nOverview\nPrimis Financial Corp. (“Primis,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is the bank holding company for Primis Bank\n(“Primis Bank” or the “Bank”), a Virginia state-chartered bank which commenced operations on April 14, 2005. Primis\nBank provides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Primis had $3.9 billion in total assets, $3.2 billion in total loans, $3.3 billion in total deposits\nand $397.6 million in total stockholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2023, Primis Bank had twenty-four full-service\nbranches in Virginia and Maryland and also provides services to customers through certain online and mobile applications.\nTwenty-two full-service retail branches are in Virginia and two full-service retail branches are in Maryland. The Company\nis headquartered in McLean, Virginia and has an administrative office in Glen Allen, Virginia and an operations center in\nAtlee, Virginia. Primis Mortgage Company, a residential mortgage lender headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina,\nis also a consolidated subsidiary of Primis Bank. PFH, is a consolidated subsidiary of Primis and owns the rights to the\nPanacea Financial brand and its intellectual property and partners with the Bank to offer a suite of financial products and\nservices for doctors, their practices, and ultimately the broader healthcare industry. Our deposits are insured, up to\napplicable limits, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).\nWe make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and\namendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act available free of\ncharge on our website at www.primisbank.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material\nwith the SEC. These reports are also available without charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nStrategy\nPrimis is focused on building a new, innovative, and better banking experience for its consumers and small and\nmedium-sized businesses. The Bank intends to grow its business, expand its customer base and improve profitability by\nfocusing on the following three areas:\n1. Maintaining a strong and efficient community bank in core markets;\n2. Supplementing core community bank growth and profitability with business lines that can generate above-average\nrisk-adjusted returns such as the Panacea Financial Division, the Life Premium Finance Division and Primis\nMortgage Company; and\n3. Perfecting enhanced digital offerings that allow Primis to attract new deposit customers at scale both in and out of\nour footprint.\nCritical to executing this approach:\n• Utilizing the Primis Management Team’s Strength. The experience and market knowledge of the Bank’s\nmanagement team is one of its greatest strengths and competitive advantages. Since the Company’s board of\n5\ndirectors appointed Mr. Dennis J. Zember, Jr. as the Chief Executive Officer, effective February 19, 2020, Mr.\nZember has added several members to the executive management team. These additional members all bring\nstrong expertise and years of experience.\n• Leveraging the Existing Foundation for Additional Growth. Based on the management team’s depth of experience\nand certain infrastructure investments, Primis looks to take advantage of certain economies of scale typically\nenjoyed by larger organizations, thus expanding its operations both organically and through strategic cost-\neffective branch or bank acquisitions. Primis’ investments in data processing, risk management infrastructure,\nand the staff and branch network will support a much larger asset base. Primis is committed to controlling\nadditional growth in a manner designed to minimize risk and to maintain strong capital ratios.\n• Investing in Technology to Differentiate the Bank in the Marketplace. The success of the Bank’s digital platform\nwas the direct result of a visionary approach to crafting new products and services. Management constantly looks\nfor ways to adopt and deploy technology solutions that provide a competitive advantage and advance the\nstrategies outlined above.\n• Continuing to Pursue Selective Acquisition Opportunities. Primis has the skillsets and experience necessary to\nacquire and successfully integrate financial institutions, banks, and branches. This, along with its strong capital\nposition, well-positions Primis to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.\n• Focusing on the Business Owner. Primis looks to be the primary bank for small- and medium-sized businesses\nby offering a suite of competitive electronic banking services, robust treasury services and comprehensive lending\noptions. We believe that Primis’ localized decision-making capabilities, prompt credit decisions, and superior\ncustomer service, supported by a highly experienced and knowledgeable management team, offers Primis a\ndistinct competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n• Focusing on Asset Quality and Underwriting. Strong asset quality is of primary importance. Therefore, despite\nthe growth in the Bank’s loan portfolio, Primis has taken measures to ensure it maintains a strong asset quality\nby upholding its well-defined underwriting standards.\n• Building a Stable Core Deposit Base. Primis continues to grow a stable core deposit base of business and retail\ncustomers. Primis intends to continue its practice of developing a deposit relationship with each of its loan\ncustomers.\nBANKING SERVICES\nOur principal business is the acquisition of deposits from the general public through our branch offices, digital platform,\nand deposit intermediaries and the use of these deposits to fund our loan and investment security portfolios. We seek to be\na full service bank that provides a wide variety of financial services to our middle market corporate clients as well as to\nour retail clients. We are an active commercial lender, and also invest funds in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized\nmortgage obligations, securities issued by agencies of the federal government and obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions.\nLending Activities Overview\nPrimis offers a wide range of commercial banking services; however, we are focused on making loans secured primarily\nby commercial real estate and other types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to small and medium-sized\nbusinesses in a number of industries, as well as loans to individuals for a variety of purposes, including home equity lines\nof credit. We are a Small Business Administration (“SBA”) lender with Preferred Lending Partner (“PLP”) status that\nallows us to offer this program nationwide. We also invest in real estate-related securities, including collateralized\nmortgage obligations and agency mortgage backed securities. Our principal sources of funds for loans and investing in\nsecurities are deposits and, to a lesser extent, borrowings.\n6\nThe following is a discussion of each of the major types of lending in which we engage. For more information on our\nlending activities, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition.”\nCommercial Lending\nCommercial Business Lending. These loans consist of lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term\nloans, equipment loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit, and unsecured loans. Commercial business loans are\ngenerally secured by business assets, equipment, accounts receivable, inventory and other collateral, such as readily\nmarketable stocks and bonds with adequate margins, cash value in life insurance policies and savings and time deposits at\nPrimis Bank.\nCommercial Real Estate Lending. Commercial real estate lending includes loans for permanent financing. Commercial\nreal estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of loans is dependent, in large part,\non sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Owner occupied\nreal estate is evaluated in conjunction with the operations of the business.\nConstruction Lending. Primis provides construction loans for commercial, multi-family, assisted living and other non-\nresidential properties, and builder/developer lines for established companies in our market footprint. Construction loan\nborrowers are generally pre-qualified for the permanent loan by us or a third party.\nSecured Asset Based Lending (SABL). Primis has developed a proprietary Asset Based Lending software system that\nallows the Bank to monitor the collateral of its commercial borrowers who have pledged their working assets (accounts\nreceivables and other qualifying assets such as inventory) as collateral. SABL has the ability to track other offsets (e.g.\nother loans the customer has with the Bank) to the line of credit. SABL serves to provide more stringent controls and\nsupervision that this type of lending requires.\nSBA Lending. Primis has developed expertise in the federally guaranteed SBA programs. The SBA programs provide\neconomic development programs which finance start-up and expansion of small businesses. We are a nationwide Preferred\nLender. As an SBA Preferred Lender, our pre-approved status allows us to quickly respond to customers’ needs. Under\nthe SBA program, we generally originate and fund SBA 7(a) and 504 loans. Benefits to Primis are low LTV commercial\nloans and government guarantees up to 80%.\nPanacea Practice Solutions. Primis, through its Panacea Financial division, provides financing for medical, dental and\nveterinary businesses. Financing purposes cover a range of needs of the borrowers to include acquisition, start-up,\nexpansion, real estate purchase and refinance, leasehold, equipment financing, as well as practice buy-ins.\nMortgage Warehouse Lending. Primis provides warehouse lending lines of credit to residential mortgage originators.\nProgram parameters and underwriting guidelines are processed and monitored through our Warehouse Loan System\n(WLS) to ensure program compliance.\nConsumer Lending\nPrimis offers various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans. We make consumer loans primarily for personal,\nfamily or household purposes.\nResidential Mortgage. Primis originates residential mortgage loans for its portfolio through Primis Mortgage\nCompany. Primis also purchases originated residential mortgages from our Warehouse Line clients, as well as other loan\noriginators. We have no sub-prime loans.\nHome Equity Lines of Credit. Primis offers credit lines secured by primary residential properties with maximum loan-\nto-values of 80%. The product provides for a 10 year draw period followed by a 20 year repayment period.\n7\nSecured Personal Loans. Primis offers secured personal loans for a variety of purposes including auto, motorcycle,\nboats, and recreational vehicles. Pledged collateral could also include marketable securities and certificates of deposits.\nLife Premium Finance. Primis offers life insurance premium financing. The loan is utilized to pay the annual premiums\ndue on the whole or universal life policy. The loan is fully secured by the cash value of the policy and personal liquid\nassets of the borrower or guarantor.\nUnsecured Personal Loans. Primis offers unsecured personal loans up to $50,000 and overdraft protection loans up to\n$10,000, based on specified underwriting criteria. We also offer these types of loans through an agreement with a third-\nparty that sources and originates them for us based on our credit underwriting criteria.\nPanacea Consumer Loans. Panacea Financial offers several unsecured consumer loan products to include student loan\nrefinancing and pro re nata (“PRN’) loans. PRN loans may be utilized by graduating doctors to fund costs as they move\ninto their chosen professions. Strict criteria has been established around these products.\nBecause future loan losses are so closely intertwined with our underwriting policy, we have instituted what\nmanagement believes is a stringent loan underwriting policy. Our underwriting guidelines are tailored for particular credit\ntypes, including lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term loans, equipment loans, real estate loans,\nSBA loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. We have instituted a no exceptions policy for our consumer\ncredit programs.\nDeposit Activities Overview\nWe offer a broad range of deposit products, including checking, NOW, savings, and money market accounts and\ncertificates of deposit, supporting the needs of businesses and individuals. We actively pursue business relationships by\nutilizing the business contacts of our senior management, other bank officers and our directors, thereby capitalizing on our\nknowledge of our local market areas.\nCommercial deposit products are enhanced by a robust suite of treasury and cash management services, including:\n• Investment/sweep accounts\n• Wire transfer services\n• Employer services/payroll processing services\n• Zero balance accounts\n• Night depository services\n• Depository transfers\n• Merchant services (third party)\n• ACH originations\n• Business debit cards\n• Controlled disbursement accounts\n• Remote deposit capture\n• Mobile and online banking\nOther products and services offered by the Bank include: Debit cards, ATM services, notary services, and wire transfer.\n8\nLines of Businesses\nPanacea Financial. In November 2020, the Company launched the Panacea Financial division, which focuses on\nproviding unique financial products and services for the medical, dental and veterinary communities. Panacea Financial\noffers personal loans, student debt refinance and practice loans as well as deposit products nationally. Panacea Financial\nhas partnerships with fourteen national and state associations. Additionally, its In-Training Medical/Dental School Loan\nRefinance product allows physicians and dentists that are in training the opportunity to refinance their student debt at a\nlower interest rate, while benefiting from affordable monthly payments during training. As of December 31, 2023, Panacea\nFinancial had approximately $322.8 million in outstanding loans. The division has successfully built a nationally-\nrecognized brand with a growing team of industry-leading commercial bankers experienced in providing financial services\nto its target communities across the United States.\nLife Premium Financing. The Company launched a division in the fourth quarter of 2021 focused on financing life\ninsurance premiums for high net worth individuals across the United States. As of December 31, 2023, the Life Premium\nFinance Division had outstanding balances, net of deferred fees, of $382.1 million. Outstanding balances on these loans\ngrow over three to five years. Consequently, the Company expects a sustainable growth rate in the division with each new\nloan originated.\nPrimis Mortgage Company. In May 2022, Primis Bank acquired Primis Mortgage Company (previously SeaTrust\nMortgage Company), a regional residential mortgage company headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina. Primis\nMortgage Company has since expanded to offer residential mortgages in the majority of the U.S. Residential mortgage\nloans originated through Primis Mortgage Company are primarily sold in the secondary market for fee income. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, Primis Mortgage originated $592.3 million loans.\nDigital Banking\nIn 2022, Primis successfully launched its digital bank platform. The platform includes an all-new mobile banking\napplication that provides a quick and seamless account opening process all from within the app. During 2023 we brought\nin over $1 billion in deposits through our digital platform.\nIn 2021, Primis launched its V1BE service, the first bank delivery app for on-demand ordering of branch services.\nV1BE brings in-branch banking services right to the customer’s doorstep, including cash delivery/withdrawals, cash pick-\nup/deposits, check deposits, change orders, cashier checks, and the instant issue of replacement debit cards. V1BE was\ninitially piloted in the Richmond market but now covers the majority of our footprint, including the greater Washington,\nD.C. region. With V1BE, Primis is able to support any market and grow customer relationships without the need for a\nlarge branch presence.\nFunding and Revenue Sources\nThe principal sources of funds for our lending and investment activities are deposits, repayment of loans, prepayments\nfrom mortgage-backed securities, repayments of maturing investment securities, Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)\nadvances and other borrowed money.\nPrincipal sources of revenue are interest and fees on loans and investment securities as well as fee income derived from\nthe maintenance of deposit accounts and income from bank-owned life insurance policies. Our principal expenses include\ninterest paid on deposits, advances from the FHLB, junior subordinated debt, senior subordinated notes and other\nborrowings, and other operating expenses.\nCREDIT ADMINISTRATION\nBecause future loan losses are so closely intertwined with our underwriting policy, we have instituted what\nmanagement believes are well-defined loan underwriting criteria and portfolio management practices. Our underwriting\nguidelines are tailored for particular credit types, including lines of credit, revolving credit facilities, demand loans, term\n9\nloans, equipment loans, real estate loans, SBA loans, stand-by letters of credit and unsecured loans. We will make\nextensions of credit based, among other factors, on the potential borrower’s creditworthiness and likelihood of repayment.\nThe Board of Directors has delegated assignment of individual credit authorities up to $10 million to the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Credit Officer. For loans up to $5.0 million, we have named Credit Officers. We also have\ntwo Specialty Executive Credit Officers, each with extensive industry specific experience with individual credit authority\nto $7.5 million. These individual lending authorities are based on the individual’s technical ability and experience. All\ncredits over $10 million are reviewed and approved by Executive Loan Committee, as defined in credit policy. For approval\nof third-party originated loans, we have delegated authority within an approved framework. All credit extensions in excess\nof 60% of the Bank’s legal lending limit are also reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. As of December 31,\n2023, our legal lending limit was approximately $63.2 million.\nPortfolio management is an integral part of sound credit practices. The responsible relationship manager in conjunction\nwith credit administration will service loan credits through their life cycle. Primis has a dedicated Special Assets team that\nprovides oversight on credit collection activities, to include legal negotiations, forbearance agreements, collateral sale,\nforeclosures and management of other real estate owned (“OREO”). This coordinated approach to credit provides a high\nquality portfolio. Credit Administration is responsible for monthly reporting to the Board of Directors on asset quality and\nperformance.\nCOMPETITION\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and our profitability depends principally on our ability to compete in the\nmarket areas in which our banking operations are located. We experience substantial competition in attracting and retaining\ndeposits and in lending funds. The primary factors we encounter in competing for deposits are convenient office locations\nand rates offered. Direct competition for deposits comes from other commercial bank and thrift institutions, money market\nmutual funds and corporate and government securities which may offer more attractive rates than insured depository\ninstitutions are willing to pay. The primary factors we encounter in competing for loans include, among others, interest\nrate and loan origination fees and the range of services offered. Competition for origination of loans normally comes from\nother commercial banks, thrift institutions, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, insurance companies and fintech or\ndigital lending companies. We have been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by:\n• emphasizing customer service and technology;\n• establishing long-term customer relationships and building customer loyalty; and\n• providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of our customers.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAt Primis, we are committed to ensuring that our employees reach their personal, professional and financial peaks. We\nare attracting, developing, retaining and planning for the succession of key talent and executives to achieve our strategic\nobjectives. Primis is continually investing in our workforce to further emphasize diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”)\nand to foster our employees’ growth and career development. As of December 31, 2023, we had 528 employees, nearly\nall of whom are full-time and of which approximately 64% were female and 21% were minorities.\nEmployee Feedback. Fostering an inclusive environment requires that all employees are heard. Our Intranet houses the\n“Employee Voice,” which is a vehicle for employees to make suggestions, asks questions or voice opinions regarding the\nCompany’s practices.\nRecruitment. While the majority of our employees reside in Virginia, our recruitment efforts are both local and\nnationwide. We utilize a wide range of recruitment vehicles ranging from college recruitment sites such as “Handshake”,\na “V3” program to recruit veterans to posting on popular job boards and conducting nationwide profile searches to find\ndiverse and qualified candidates. Primis realizes that great people know other great people so we also offer a referral bonus\nto our employees.\n10\nBenefits. Primis offers a comprehensive and competitive benefits package to meet a variety of individual needs. We\noffer three different medical plans, two of which allow for the employee to make contributions and receive an employer\nmatch on a Health Savings Account. In addition to dental insurance, supplemental insurance and a 401k, Primis offers\nemployer paid short-term and long-term disability and life insurance. Our employees also enjoy an incentive for\nparticipating in our Wellness Program.\nDevelopment. All new employees benefit from training to learn how to utilize key Company systems. New employees\nare also required to complete multiple learning modules that cover important compliance and regulatory requirements in\nthe banking industry. Continuing education and advanced training is offered to employees throughout their tenure at\nPrimis. We encourage all employees to obtain job related training by covering the cost of the classes and/or learning\nmaterials and tests.\nVolunteerism.

We maintain a\ncommitment to the prosperity of each community the Company serves, donating to community, civic and philanthropic\norganizations in 2023. In addition to providing financial products built for the needs of our customers, the Company uses\nassociate volunteerism and corporate philanthropy to build strong community partnerships. Our employees volunteered\nfor 200 hours in 2023.\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nBank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under federal and state law.

Under this authority, our bank regulators\ncan require us or our subsidiaries to enter into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions,\nmemoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which we would be\nrequired to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions.\nIf we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory actions or directives,\nsupervisory agreements, or orders, then we could become subject to additional, heightened supervisory actions and orders,\npossibly including consent orders, prompt corrective action restrictions and/or other regulatory actions, including\nprohibitions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock. If our regulators were to take such\nadditional supervisory actions, then we could, among other things, become subject to significant restrictions on our ability\nto develop any new business, as well as restrictions on our existing business, and we could be required to raise additional\ncapital, dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time, or both. The terms of any such\nsupervisory action could have a material negative effect on our business, reputation, operating flexibility, financial\ncondition, and the value of our capital stock.\n11\nSupervision, regulation, and examination of Primis, the Bank, and our respective subsidiaries by the appropriate\nregulatory agencies, as described herein, are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank depositors and the\nDeposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the U.S. banking and\nfinancial system, rather than holders of our capital stock.\nBank Holding Company Regulation\nPrimis is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the Bank Holding\nCompany Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). We are required to file with the Federal Reserve\nperiodic reports and such other information as the Federal Reserve may request. Ongoing supervision is provided through\nregular examinations by the Federal Reserve and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to\nidentify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws\nand regulations. In addition to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company, Primis is subject to\nsupervision and regulation by the VBFI under the banking and general business corporation laws of the Commonwealth\nof Virginia.\nActivity Limitations. Primis is registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act and has elected to be a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, Primis is permitted to\nengage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company. Bank\nholding companies generally are limited to the business of banking, managing or controlling banks, and other activities\nthat the Federal Reserve determines to be closely related to banking, or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper\nincident thereto. Bank holding companies are prohibited from acquiring or obtaining control of more than five percent\n(5%) of the outstanding voting interests of any company that engages in activities other than those activities permissible\nfor bank holding companies. Examples of activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be permissible are making,\nacquiring, brokering, or servicing loans; leasing personal property; providing certain investment or financial advice;\nperforming certain data processing services; acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other insurance\nproducts in certain locations; and performing certain insurance underwriting activities. The Bank Holding Company Act\ndoes not place geographic limits on permissible non-banking activities of bank holding companies. Financial holding\ncompanies, such as us, may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature, as well as those incidental\nor, if so determined by the Federal Reserve, complementary to financial activities. Primis and the Bank must each remain\n“well-capitalized” and “well-managed” and the Bank must receive a Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) rating of at\nleast “Satisfactory” at its most recent examination in order for the Company to maintain its status as a financial holding\ncompany. In addition, the Federal Reserve has the power to order a financial holding company or its subsidiaries to\nterminate any non-banking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any non-bank subsidiary, when it has\nreasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the\nfinancial safety, soundness, or stability of any bank subsidiary of that financial holding company. As further described\nbelow, each of Primis and the Bank is well-capitalized as of December 31, 2023, and Primis Bank achieved a rating of\n“Satisfactory” in its most recent CRA evaluation.\nSource of Strength Obligations. A bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial\nstrength to its subsidiary bank. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability of a company, such as us, that\ndirectly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, to provide financial assistance\nto such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress. The appropriate federal banking agency for the\ndepository institution (in the case of the Bank, this agency is the Federal Reserve) may require reports from us to assess\nour ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring\nus to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of financial distress. If we were to enter bankruptcy or become\nsubject to the orderly liquidation process established by the Dodd-Frank Act, any commitment by us to a federal bank\nregulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the FDIC, as\nappropriate, and entitled to a priority of payment. In addition, the FDIC provides that any insured depository institution\ngenerally will be liable for any loss incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or any assistance provided by\nthe FDIC to, a commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Bank is an FDIC-insured depository institution\nand thus subject to these requirements.\n12\nAcquisitions. The Bank Holding Company Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of\nthe Federal Reserve or waiver of such prior approval before it (1) acquires ownership or control of any voting shares of\nany bank if, after such acquisition, such bank holding company will own or control more than five percent (5%) of the\nvoting shares of such bank, (2) acquires all of the assets of a bank, or (3) merges with any other bank holding company.\nIn reviewing a proposed covered acquisition, among other factors, the Federal Reserve considers (1) the financial and\nmanagerial resources of the companies involved, including pro forma capital ratios; (2) the risk to the stability of the\nUnited States banking or financial system; (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including\nperformance under the CRA; and (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering. The Federal\nReserve also reviews any indebtedness to be incurred by a bank holding company in connection with a proposed acquisition\nto ensure that the bank holding company can service such indebtedness without adversely affecting its ability to serve as\na source of strength to its bank subsidiaries. Well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies are permitted to\nacquire control of banks in any state, subject to federal regulatory approval, without regard to whether such a transaction\nis prohibited by the laws of any state. However, a bank holding company may not, following an interstate acquisition,\ncontrol more than 10% of nationwide insured deposits or 30% of deposits within any state in which the acquiring bank\noperates.\nChange in Control. Federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a\nperson (including an entity) may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators. Under the federal Change in\nBank Control Act and the regulations thereunder, a person or group must give advance notice to and obtain approval from\nthe Federal Reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company, such as Primis. The Change in Bank Control\nAct creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a person or group acquires the power to vote 10% or more of our\noutstanding common stock. The overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company\nor a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation. Consequently,\nshareholders of the Company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from\ntender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies. Investors should be aware of these requirements\nwhen acquiring shares of our stock.\nVirginia Law. Certain state corporation laws may have an anti-takeover affect. Virginia law restricts transactions\nbetween a Virginia corporation and its affiliates and potential acquirers. The following discussion summarizes the two\nVirginia statutes that may discourage an attempt to acquire control of Primis.\nVirginia Code Sections 13.1-725 – 727.1 govern “Affiliated Transactions.” These provisions, with several exceptions\ndiscussed below, require approval by the holders of at least two-thirds of the remaining voting shares of material\nacquisition transactions between a Virginia corporation and any holder of more than 10% of its outstanding voting shares.\nAffiliated Transactions include mergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary\ncourse of business, any dissolution of the corporation proposed by or on behalf of an interested shareholder, or any\nreclassification, including a reverse stock split, recapitalization, or merger of the corporation with its subsidiaries which\nincreases the percentage of voting shares owned beneficially by any 10% shareholder by more than 5%.\nThese provisions were designed to deter certain takeovers of Virginia corporations. In addition, the statute provides\nthat, by affirmative vote of a majority of the voting shares other than shares owned by any 10% shareholder, a corporation\ncan adopt an amendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws providing that the Affiliated Transactions provisions\nshall not apply to the corporation. Primis “opted out” of the Affiliated Transactions provisions when it incorporated.\nVirginia law also provides that shares acquired in a transaction that would cause the acquiring person’s voting strength\nto meet or exceed any of the three thresholds (20%, 33.33% or 50%) have no voting rights for those shares exceeding that\nthreshold, unless granted by a majority vote of shares not owned by the acquiring person. This provision empowers an\nacquiring person to require the Virginia Corporation to hold a special meeting of shareholders to consider the matter within\n50 days of the request. Primis also “opted out” of this provision at the time of its incorporation.\nGovernance and Financial Reporting Obligations. We are required to comply with various corporate governance and\nfinancial reporting requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations adopted by the\nSEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and NASDAQ. In particular, we are required to include\nmanagement and independent registered public accounting firm reports on internal controls as part of our Annual Report\n13\non Form 10-K in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have evaluated our controls, including\ncompliance with the SEC rules on internal controls, and have and expect to continue to spend significant amounts of time\nand money on compliance with these rules. Our failure to comply with these internal control rules may materially\nadversely affect our reputation, ability to obtain the necessary certifications to financial statements, and the values of our\nsecurities.\nCorporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protections, corporate governance, and\nexecutive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act (1) granted\nshareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation; (2) enhanced independence\nrequirements for Compensation Committee members; and (3) required companies listed on national securities exchanges\nto adopt incentive-based compensation claw-back policies for executive officers.\nIncentive Compensation. Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve and by other\nfinancial regulatory agencies. The federal banking regulators have issued joint guidance on executive compensation\ndesigned to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations take into account risk factors and are\nconsistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. The guidance also provides that supervisory findings with\nrespect to incentive compensation will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its\nability to make acquisitions or other corporate decisions. The guidance further provides that the regulators may pursue\nenforcement actions against a banking organization if its incentive compensation and related risk management, control or\ngovernance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safe and sound practices. Enforcement actions may be taken against\na banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance\nprocesses, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness, and the organization is not taking prompt and effective\nmeasures to correct the deficiencies. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC\nto issue regulations requiring covered financial institutions to prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that\nencourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to\nthe institution. In October 2022, the SEC adopted final rules implementing the incentive-based compensation recovery\n(“clawback”) provisions mandated by Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules directed U.S. stock exchanges\nto require listed companies to implement, disclose and enforce clawback policies to recover excess incentive-based\ncompensation that current or former executive officers received based on financial reporting measures that are later\nrestated. In June 2023, the SEC approved the proposed clawback listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC\n(“Nasdaq”), which now require Nasdaq-listed companies, to (i) adopt and implement a compliant clawback policy; (ii) file\nthe clawback policy as an exhibit to their annual reports; and (iii) provide certain disclosures relating to any compensation\nrecovery triggered by the clawback policy. Our clawback policy was approved by the board in November 2023 and is filed\nherein as Exhibit 97.\nShareholder Say-On-Pay Votes. The Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to take shareholders’ votes on\nproposals addressing compensation (known as say-on-pay), the frequency of a say-on-pay vote, and the golden parachutes\navailable to executives in connection with change-in-control transactions. Public companies must give shareholders the\nopportunity to vote on the compensation at least every three years and the opportunity to vote on frequency at least every\nsix years, indicating whether the say-on-pay vote should be held annually, biennially, or triennially.\nAnti-tying rules. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying\narrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing of services.\nCapital Requirements\nPrimis and the Bank are each required under federal law to maintain certain minimum capital levels based on ratios of\ncapital to total assets and capital to risk-weighted assets. The required capital ratios are minimums, and the federal banking\nagencies may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher\nlevel of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. Risks such as concentration of credit risks and the risk\narising from non-traditional activities, as well as the institution’s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital\ndue to changes in interest rates, and an institution’s ability to manage those risks are important factors that are to be taken\ninto account in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy. The following is a brief description of the relevant\nprovisions of these capital rules and their potential impact on our capital levels.\n14\nPrimis and the Bank are each subject to the following risk-based capital ratios: a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) risk-\nbased capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, which includes CET1 and additional Tier 1 capital, and a total risk-\nbased capital ratio, which includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 is primarily comprised of the sum of common stock\ninstruments and related surplus net of treasury stock, plus retained earnings and certain qualifying minority interests, less\ncertain adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, mortgage servicing assets and\ndeferred tax assets subject to temporary timing differences. Additional Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of\nnoncumulative perpetual preferred stock, tier 1 minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities. Tier 2 capital\nconsists of instruments disqualified from Tier 1 capital, including qualifying subordinated debt, other preferred stock and\ncertain hybrid capital instruments, and a limited amount of loan loss reserves up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted\nassets, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The capital rules also define the risk-weights assigned to assets and off-balance\nsheet items to determine the risk-weighted asset components of the risk-based capital rules, including, for example, certain\n“high volatility” commercial real estate, past due assets, structured securities and equity holdings.\nThe leverage capital ratio, which serves as a minimum capital standard, is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average\ntotal consolidated assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required deduction items. The required\nminimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%.\nIn addition, effective January 1, 2019, the capital rules require a capital conservation buffer of CET1 of 2.5% above\neach of the minimum capital ratio requirements (CET1, Tier 1, and total risk-based capital), which is designed to absorb\nlosses during periods of economic stress. These buffer requirements must be met for a bank or bank holding company to\nbe able to pay dividends, engage in share buybacks or make discretionary bonus payments to executive management\nwithout restriction.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), among other things, requires the\nfederal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” regarding depository institutions that do not meet\nminimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five regulatory capital tiers: “well capitalized”, “adequately\ncapitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. A depository\ninstitution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain\nother factors, as established by regulation. FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital\ndistribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository\ninstitution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on\noperations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified.\nTo be well-capitalized, the Bank must maintain at least the following capital ratios:\n• 6.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets;\n• 8.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;\n• 10.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and\n• 5.0% leverage ratio.\nThe Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies to reflect the higher\ncapital requirements imposed under the current capital rules. For purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y, bank\nholding companies, such as Primis, must maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and a total risk-based\ncapital ratio of 10.0% or greater to be well-capitalized. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a similar well-\ncapitalized standard to bank holding companies as that applicable to the Bank, Primis’ capital ratios as of December 31,\n2023 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard. Also, the Federal Reserve may require bank holding companies,\nincluding Primis, to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general\neconomic conditions and a bank holding company’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.\nFailure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible\nadditional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations\nor financial condition. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on Primis’ or the\nBank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications or other\nrestrictions on its growth.\n15\nBoth Primis and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the applicable well-capitalized standards and met the\ncapital conservation buffer as of December 31, 2023. Based on current estimates, we believe that Primis and the Bank will\ncontinue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer in\n2024.\nOn October 29, 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule to simplify the regulatory capital\nrequirements for eligible banks and holding companies with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets that opt into the\nCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio (“CBLR”) framework. A qualifying community banking organization with total\nconsolidated assets of less than $10 billion that exceeds the CBLR threshold would be exempt from the agencies’ current\ncapital framework, including the risk-based capital requirements and capital conservation buffer described above, and\nwould be deemed well-capitalized under the agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations. Under the final rule, if a\nqualifying community banking organization elects to use the CBLR framework, it will be considered “well-capitalized”\nso long as its CBLR is greater than 9%. Primis does not use the CBLR framework.\nPayment of Dividends\nPrimis is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and other subsidiaries. Its primary source of cash, other than\nsecurities offerings, is dividends from the Bank. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, no dividends may be paid by\nan insured bank if the bank is in arrears in the payment of any insurance assessment due to the FDIC. The payment of\ndividends by the Bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies, such as the maintenance of\nadequate capital. If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in, or is\nabout to engage in, an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include\nthe payment of dividends), such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that the bank cease and desist from that\npractice. The Federal Reserve has formal and informal policies which provide that insured banks should generally pay\ndividends only out of current operating earnings.\nUnder a Federal Reserve policy adopted in 2009, the board of directors of a bank holding company must consider\ncertain factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to maintaining a strong financial position, and is not\nbased on overly optimistic earnings scenarios, such as potential events that could affect its ability to pay, while still\nmaintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors\nof a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the bank\nholding company’s dividends if:\n• its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during\nthat period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n• its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and\nprospective financial condition; or\n• it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nBank Regulation\nThe operation of the Bank is subject to state and federal statutes applicable to state banks and the regulations of the\nFederal Reserve, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). The operations of the Bank may\nalso be subject to applicable Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regulation to the extent state banks are\ngranted parity with national banks. Such statutes and regulations relate to, among other things, required reserves,\ninvestments, loans, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, establishment of branches,\nconsumer protection and other aspects of the Bank’s operations. Violations of laws and regulations, or other unsafe and\nunsound practices, may result in these agencies imposing fines or penalties, cease and desist orders, or taking other\nenforcement actions. Under certain circumstances, these agencies may enforce these remedies directly against officers,\ndirectors, employees and other parties participating in the affairs of a bank or bank holding company.\nSafety and Soundness. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal prudential bank regulatory agencies,\nsuch as the Federal Reserve, to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured\ndepository institutions relating to: (1) internal controls; (2) information systems and audit systems; (3) loan documentation;\n16\n(4) credit underwriting; (5) interest rate risk exposure; and (6) asset quality. The agencies also must prescribe standards\nfor asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees and benefits. The federal\nbanking agencies have adopted regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness\nto implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and\naddress problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Under the regulations, if a regulator\ndetermines that a bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines, the regulator may require the bank to\nsubmit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety\nand soundness compliance plans.\nExaminations. The Bank is subject to regulation, reporting, and periodic examinations by the Federal Reserve and the\nVBFI. These regulatory authorities routinely examine the Bank’s reserves, loan and investment quality, consumer\ncompliance, management policies, procedures and practices and other aspects of operations. The Federal Reserve has\nadopted the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (“FFIEC”) rating system and assigns each financial\ninstitution a confidential composite rating based on an evaluation and rating of six essential components of an institution’s\nfinancial condition and operations, including Capital Adequacy, Asset Quality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and\nSensitivity to Market Risk, as well as the quality of risk management practices.\nConsumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, an independent regulatory authority housed within\nthe Federal Reserve having centralized authority, including examination and enforcement authority, for consumer\nprotection in the banking industry. The CFPB has rule writing, examination, and enforcement authority with regard to the\nBank’s (and Primis’) compliance with a wide array of consumer financial protection laws, including the Truth in Lending\nAct, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal\nCredit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, the Fair Credit\nReporting Act (except Sections 615(e) and 628), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\n(sections 502 through 509 relating to privacy), among others. The CFPB has broad authority to enforce a prohibition on\nunfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. Authority to supervise and examine Primis and the Bank for compliance\nwith federal consumer laws remains largely with the Federal Reserve. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations\non a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. In\naddition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those\nregulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules\nadopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.\nDeposit Insurance Assessments. The Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC insures the deposits of the Bank\ngenerally up to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. The FDIC\ncharges insured depository institutions quarterly premiums to maintain the DIF. Deposit insurance assessments are based\non average total consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity and take into account certain risk-based financial\nratios and other factors. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject\nto certain limits.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the DIF reserve ratio fell to 1.30%, below the statutory minimum of 1.35%. The FDIC, as required\nunder the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, established a plan on September 15, 2020 to restore the DIF reserve ratio to meet\nor exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC adopted a final plan and\nincreased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, beginning in the first\nquarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment rate schedules will remain in effect until the reserve ratio\nmeets or exceeds 2 percent, absent further action by the FDIC.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or\nunsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law,\nregulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a bank’s federal regulatory agency. In addition, the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the\nclaims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain\nclaims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against\nthe institution, including those of the parent bank holding company.\n17\nInsider Transactions. The Federal Reserve has adopted regulations that restrict preferential loans and loan amounts to\n“affiliates” and “insiders” of banks, require banks to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive\nofficers and bar certain director and officer interlocks between financial institutions.\nReserves. The Bank is subject to Federal Reserve regulations that require the Bank to maintain reserves against\ntransaction accounts (primarily checking accounts). These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the\nFederal Reserve. Effective March 26, 2020, reserve requirement ratios were reduced to zero percent.\nAnti-Money Laundering. A continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years\nhas been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act broadened the application of anti-\nmoney laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as broker-dealers, investment\nadvisors and insurance companies, and strengthened the ability of the U.S. Government to help prevent, detect and\nprosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The principal provisions of Title III of the USA\nPATRIOT Act require that regulated financial institutions, including state member banks: (i) establish an anti-money\nlaundering program that includes training and audit components; (ii) comply with regulations regarding the verification of\nthe identity of any person seeking to open an account; (iii) take additional required precautions with non-U.S. owned\naccounts; and (iv) perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent\nbanking relationships. Failure of a financial institution to comply with the USA PATRIOT Act’s requirements could have\nserious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. Primis Bank has augmented its systems and procedures to\nmeet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to\nreflect changes required by law.\nFinCEN has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to\nlegal entities with which such institutions conduct business, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions. Bank regulators\nare focusing their examinations on anti-money laundering compliance, and we continue to monitor and augment, where\nnecessary, our anti-money laundering compliance programs.\nBank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these anti-money laundering obligations and have\nbeen active in imposing “cease and desist” and other regulatory orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions\nfound to be in violation of these requirements. On January 1, 2021, Congress passed federal legislation that made sweeping\nchanges to federal anti-money laundering laws, including changes that will be implemented in subsequent years.\nEconomic Sanctions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S.\nentities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and acts of\nCongress. OFAC publishes, and routinely updates, lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding,\nharboring or engaging in terrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. If we find\na name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, we must undertake certain specified activities,\nwhich could include blocking or freezing the account or transaction requested, and we must notify the appropriate\nauthorities.\nConcentrations in Lending. During 2006, the federal bank regulatory agencies released guidance on “Concentrations\nin Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “Guidance”) and advised financial institutions of the risks posed by CRE lending\nconcentrations. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks\nassociated with real estate lending concentrations. Higher allowances for credit losses and capital levels may also be\nrequired. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either:\n• Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank’s total risk\nbased capital; or\n• Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction,\nland development, and other land of 300% or more of a bank’s total risk based capital.\nThe Guidance also applies when a bank has a sharp increase in CRE loans or has significant concentrations of CRE\nsecured by a particular property type.\n18\nCommunity Reinvestment Act. The Bank is subject to the provisions of the CRA, which imposes a continuing and\naffirmative obligation, consistent with their safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of entire communities\nwhere the bank accepts deposits, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The Federal Reserve’s assessment\nof the Bank’s CRA record is made available to the public. Further, a less than satisfactory CRA rating will slow, if not\npreclude, expansion of banking activities and prevent a company from becoming or remaining a financial holding\ncompany. Federal CRA regulations require, among other things, that evidence of discrimination against applicants on a\nprohibited basis, and illegal or abusive lending practices be considered in the CRA evaluation. On October 24, 2023, the\nOCC, the FRB, and FDIC issued a final rule to modernize their respective CRA regulations. The revised rules substantially\nalter the methodology for assessing compliance with the CRA, with material aspects taking effect January 1, 2026 and\nrevised data reporting requirements taking effect January 1, 2027. Among other things, the revised rules evaluate lending\noutside traditional assessment areas generated by the growth of non-branch delivery systems, such as online and mobile\nbanking, apply a metrics-based benchmarking approach to assessment, and clarify eligible CRA activities. The final rules\nmay make it more challenging and/or costly for the Bank to receive a rating of at least “satisfactory” on its CRA exam.\nConsumer Regulation. Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect\nconsumers. These laws and regulations include, among numerous other things, provisions that:\n• limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank, including rules respecting the terms\nof credit cards and of debit card overdrafts;\n• govern the Bank’s disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;\n• require the Bank to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether it is\nfulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;\n• prohibit the Bank from discriminating on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors when it makes\ndecisions to extend credit;\n• govern the manner in which the Bank may collect consumer debts; and\n• prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in the provision of consumer financial products and services.\nMortgage Rules. Pursuant to rules adopted by the CFPB, banks that make residential mortgage loans are required to\nmake a good faith determination that a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage loan prior to extending such credit,\nrequire that certain mortgage loans contain escrow payments, obtain new appraisals under certain circumstances, comply\nwith integrated mortgage disclosure rules, and follow specific rules regarding the compensation of loan originators and\nthe servicing of residential mortgage loans.\nTransactions with affiliates. There are various restrictions that limit the ability of the Bank to finance, pay dividends\nor otherwise supply funds to Primis or other affiliates. In addition, banks are subject to certain restrictions under\nSection 23A and B of the Federal Reserve Act on certain transactions, including any extension of credit to its bank holding\ncompany or any of its other affiliates, on investments in the securities thereof, and on the taking of such securities as\ncollateral for loans to any borrower.\nPrivacy and Cybersecurity. The Bank is subject to federal and state banking regulations that limit its ability to disclose\nnon-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require us to periodically disclose\nour privacy policies to consumers and allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-\naffiliated third party under certain circumstances. Consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial\ninstitutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of\nmarketing products or services. Banking institutions are required to implement a comprehensive information security\nprogram that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of\ncustomer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of confidential\nand personal information are in effect across our lines of business. Furthermore, the federal banking regulators regularly\nissue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management. A financial institution is expected to\nimplement multiple lines of defense against cyber-attacks and ensure that their risk management procedures address the\nrisk posed by potential cyber threats. A financial institution is further expected to maintain procedures to effectively\nrespond to a cyber-attack and resume operations following any such attack. Primis has adopted and implemented policies\nand procedures to comply with these privacy, information security, and cybersecurity requirements. The federal banking\n19\nagencies require banks to notify their regulators within 36 hours of a “computer-security incident” that rises to the level of\na “notification incident.”\nNon-Discrimination Policies. Primis Bank is also subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or color, religion, national\norigin, sex, and familial status in any aspect of a consumer or commercial credit or residential real estate transaction. The\nDepartment of Justice, and the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on\nDiscrimination in Lending that provides guidance to financial institutions in determining whether discrimination exists,\nhow the agencies will respond to lending discrimination, and what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory\nlending practices. The DOJ has increased its efforts to prosecute what it regards as violations of the ECOA and FHA.\nLIBOR. On March 15, 2022, Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) to address\nreferences to LIBOR in contracts that (i) are governed by U.S. law; (ii) will not mature before June 30, 2023; and (iii) lack\nfallback provisions providing for a clearly defined and practicable replacement for LIBOR. On December 16, 2022, the\nFRB adopted a final rule to implement the LIBOR Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR (Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate) that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023. The final rule identifies\nreplacement benchmark rates based on SOFR to replace overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month, and 12-month\nLIBOR in contracts subject to the LIBOR Act. The Company has replaced LIBOR with SOFR in applicable contracts.\nAudit Reports. Insured institutions with total assets of $500 million or more must submit annual audit reports prepared\nby independent auditors to federal and state regulators. In some instances, the audit report of the institution’s holding\ncompany can be used to satisfy this requirement. Independent auditors must receive examination reports, supervisory\nagreements and reports of enforcement actions. For insured institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more, financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management’s certifications concerning responsibility for the\nfinancial statements, internal controls and compliance with legal requirements designated by the FDIC, and an attestation\nby the independent auditor regarding the statements of management relating to the internal controls must be submitted.\nFor insured institutions with total assets of more than $3.0 billion, independent auditors may be required to review quarterly\nfinancial statements. The FDICIA requires that institutions with total assets of $1.0 billion or more have independent audit\ncommittees, consisting of outside directors only. The committees of insured institutions with total assets of $3.0 billion or\nmore must include members with experience in banking or financial management, must have access to outside counsel,\nand must not include representatives of large customers.\nThe foregoing is only a brief summary of certain statutes, rules, and regulations that may affect Primis and the Bank.\nNumerous other statutes and regulations also will have an impact on the operations of Primis and the Bank. Supervision,\nregulation and examination of banks by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, not\nshareholders.\n20\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves risks. The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties\nthat Primis Financial Corp. believes affect its business and should be considered before making an investment in our\ncommon stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may\nbecome important factors that affect us and our business. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nwere to actually occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely\naffected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly and you could lose part or all\nof your investment. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of\ncertain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please\nrefer to the section in this Form 10-K entitled “Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for\nadditional information regarding forward-looking statements.\nSummary\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives\nor may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. These risks are\ndiscussed more fully after the summary, and risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• We are subject to risks related to our concentration of construction and land development and commercial real\nestate loans.\n• We have a meaningful amount of consumer loans that are unsecured and if the borrower defaults on the loan we\nhave no recourse to collateral in which to recover any potential losses.\n• A portion of our consumer loan portfolio is originated and serviced by a third-party and includes a credit\nenhancement from that third-party which may not be realizable.\n• A significant amount of our third-party serviced consumer loans were originated with a zero interest promotional\nperiod, exposing us to the credit risk of the third-party that is providing reimbursement to us for interest foregone.\n• A significant amount of our loans are secured by real estate and any declines in real estate values in our primary\nmarkets could be detrimental to our financial condition and results of operations.\n• If our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will suffer.\n• If our allowance for credit losses is not adequate to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\n• We are subject to credit quality risks and our credit policies may not be sufficient to avoid losses.\n• The Company’s mortgage revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic\nconditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely\nimpact our profits.\n• Our geographic concentration makes us vulnerable to local weather catastrophes, public health issues, and other\nexternal events, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n• Our business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial\nperformance.\n• Unstable global economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial\ncondition, and operations.\n• Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investment\nsecurities, financial performance and capital.\n• The value of an estimated reimbursement due from a third-party that originated consumer loans with promotional\nfeatures on our behalf is recorded in our balance sheet at fair value as a derivative and actual results and a\nsignificant decline in the third-party’s credit risk may impact the value of the derivative and our ability to realize\nthat value.\n• Our stock price can be volatile.\n• The trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\n• Inflation could negatively impact our business, our profitability and our stock price.\n• ESG risks could adversely affect our reputation and shareholder, employee, client, and third party relationships\nand may negatively affect our stock price.\n21\n• Our business strategy includes strategic growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be\nnegatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\n• We must respond to rapid technological changes and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than\nanticipated.\n• New lines of business, products or services and technological advancements may subject us to additional risks.\n• We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions or to realize the anticipated benefits of them.\n• The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be adversely affected.\n• We rely on third-party vendors to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\n• We face significant cyber and data security risk that could result in the disclosure of confidential information,\nadversely affect our business or reputation and expose us to significant liabilities.\n• Our business is susceptible to fraud.\n• We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could impair our\nrelationship with our customers and adversely affect our business.\n• Deposit insurance premiums levied against banks may increase if the number of bank failures increase or the cost\nof resolving failed banks increases.\n• Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows.\n• Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect our current and projected\nbusiness operations and its financial condition and results of operations.\n• Future growth or operating results may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available,\nbe available on unfavorable terms or may be dilutive.\n• We may issue a new series of preferred stock or debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock and\nmay cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n• We currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock; however, our future ability to pay dividends is subject\nto restrictions.\n• Changes in applicable laws and regulations or failures to comply with such laws and regulations may adversely\naffect our operations and our financial results.\n• Primis and the Bank must maintain certain required levels of regulatory capital that may limit our operations and\npotential growth.\n• We are subject to commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators that impacts\nour operations and capital requirements.\n• Changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.\n• Failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations and financial condition and could impact the price of our common stock.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to risks related to our concentration of construction and land development and commercial real estate\nloans.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $164.7 million of construction and land development loans, or 5.1% of our loan\nportfolio. Construction and land development loans are subject to risks during the construction phase that are not present\nin standard residential real estate and commercial real estate loans. These risks include:\n• the viability of the contractor;\n• the contractor’s ability to successfully complete the project, to meet deadlines and time schedules and to\nstay within cost estimates, especially in the event of supply disruptions and labor shortages; and\n• concentrations of such loans with a single contractor and its affiliates.\nReal estate construction and land development loans may involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment\ndependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan\nand also present risks of default in the event of declines in property values or volatility in the real estate market during the\n22\nconstruction phase. Our practice, in the majority of instances, is to secure the personal guaranty of individuals in support\nof our real estate construction and land development loans which provides us with an additional source of repayment. As\nof December 31, 2023, we did not have any nonperforming construction and land development loans. If one or more of\nour larger borrowers were to default on their construction and land development loans, and we did not have alternative\nsources of repayment through personal guarantees or other sources, or if any of the aforementioned risks were to occur,\nwe could incur significant losses.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $1.17 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding, or 36.3% of our loan\nportfolio, including multi-family residential loans and loans secured by farmland. Commercial real estate lending typically\ninvolves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the\nproperties securing the loan to cover operating expenses and debt service.\nWe have a meaningful amount of consumer loans that are unsecured and if the borrower defaults on the loan we have no\nrecourse to collateral in which to recover any potential losses.\nOur consumer loan portfolio that are unsecured is $328.0 million, or approximately 10.0% of our total loan portfolio,\nas of December 31, 2023. Included in this portfolio is $199.3 million of loans sourced based on our credit underwriting\ncriteria and managed by a third party. Consumer loan repayment is primarily driven by the borrower’s personal income\nwhich is impacted by various factors that are outside of the control of the borrower including macroeconomic conditions\nsuch as inflation and interest rates. Further, a downturn in the economy or other company-specific decisions that result in\na borrower losing their job could cause the borrower’s primary source of income for repayment of the loan to decline.\nEach of these factors may cause a borrower to evaluate their debts and as a result they may prioritize payment of other\ndebts above the consumer loan due to us. Although macroeconomic conditions and the economy are currently stable, such\nconditions can change relatively quick and may not remain at current levels. If conditions change and macroeconomic\nconditions and the economy worsen borrowers may stop paying their loans and it could require us to increase our provision\nfor credit losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our consumer loan portfolio is originated and serviced by a third-party and includes a credit enhancement\nfrom that third-party which may not be realizable and the inability to utilize it could be detrimental to our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe receive a credit enhancement from the third-party managing $199.3 million of consumer loans that are recorded\non our balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. The credit enhancement is primarily provided through cash flows derived\nfrom loan originations. If lending slows or stops it would cause monthly cash receipts related to this credit enhancement\nto decline, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant amount of our third-party serviced consumer loans were originated with a zero interest promotional period\nexposing us to the credit risk of the third-party that is providing reimbursement to us for interest foregone in the event of\nborrower prepayment and failure of the third-party to perform under its reimbursement obligation could be detrimental\nto our financial condition and results of operations.\nWithin the $199.3 million third-party originated and serviced consumer loan portfolio there is 45% of the portfolio that\nis in a promotional interest period as of December 31, 2023. The loans in these promotional interest periods legally accrue\ninterest at the stated rate of the note agreement but the interest is not required to be paid during the promotional period.\nFurther, if the borrower repays all of the principal on the note prior to the end of the promotional period the accrued interest\nis waived, but if there is any principal balance remaining at the end of the promotional period the borrower must repay all\nof the interest that has accrued. As of December 31, 2023, the amount of deferred interest on these loans was $12.2 million.\nThrough an agreement with the third-party servicer, we are entitled to payment of all accrued interest that is waived on\nloans that repay all principal within the promotional period. There is a large concentration of these loans originated within\nproximity to each other resulting in 70% of the current balance of promotional loans ending their promotional period in\nthe second half of 2024 through the first quarter of 2025. If a high percentage of these loans repay at the end of their\npromotional period a large amount of interest reimbursement will be due in a short period of time from the third-party\nservicer and if they cannot perform then we may not be able to realize any income on a significant amount of loans in our\nportfolio, which may adversely impact the realization of the fair value of the derivative asset recognized.\n23\nA si gnificant amount of our loans are secured by real estate and any declines in real estate values in our primary markets\ncould be detrimental to our financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate lending (including commercial, construction, land development, and residential loans) is a large portion of\nour loan portfolio, constituting $2.0 billion, or approximately 62.2% of our total loan portfolio, as of December 31, 2023.\nAlthough residential and commercial real estate values are currently strong in our market area, such values may not remain\nelevated. If loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining\nor have declined, then we may not be able to realize the full value of the collateral that we anticipated at the time of\noriginating the loan, which could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 36.3% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans secured by commercial real estate,\nincluding multi-family residential loans and loans secured by farmland. As of December 31, 2023, $665.9 million, or\napproximately 20.7% of our total loans, were secured by single-family residential real estate. This includes $606.2 million\nin residential 1-4 family loans and $59.7 million in home equity lines of credit. If housing prices in our market areas do\nnot remain strong or deteriorate, we may experience an increase in nonperforming loans, provision for credit losses and\ncharge-offs. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real\nestate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will suffer.\nAt December 31, 2023, our nonperforming assets (which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days and\naccruing and OREO) totaled $10.8 million, or 0.34% of total loans and OREO, which is a decrease of $28.0 million, or\n72.2%, compared with nonperforming assets of $38.8 million, or 1.32% of total non-covered loans and OREO at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nEconomic and market conditions have been unstable, and although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of total\nloans and OREO remains manageable, we may incur losses if there is an increase in nonperforming assets in the future.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual\nloans or OREO, thereby adversely affecting our net interest income, and increasing loan administration costs. When we\ntake collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related loan to the then fair value of\nthe collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. We must reserve for expected losses, which is established through a\ncurrent period charge to the provision for credit losses as well as from time to time, as appropriate, a write down of the\nvalue of properties in our OREO portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated\nwith the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our\nOREO. Further, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract\nthem from more profitable activity. Finally, an increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our regulatory risk\nprofile. There can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in nonperforming assets.\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not adequate to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these\nloans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to ensure repayment. We make various\nassumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of the borrowers\nand the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. The amount\nof the allowance represents management’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available\ninformation, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans’ contractual terms,\nadjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we experience\nsignificant loan losses, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses and adjustments may be\nnecessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. A material addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses could cause our earnings to decrease. Due to the relatively unseasoned nature of portions\nof our loan portfolio, we may experience an increase in delinquencies and losses as these loans continue to mature.\n24\nIn addition, federal regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our\nprovision for credit losses or recognize further charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management.\nAny significant increase in our allowance for credit losses or charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies would\nresult in a decrease in net income and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe are subject to credit quality risks and our credit policies may not be sufficient to avoid losses.\nWe are subject to the risk of losses resulting from the failure of borrowers, guarantors and related parties to pay interest\nand principal amounts on their loans. Although we maintain credit policies and credit underwriting, monitoring and\ncollection procedures, these policies and procedures may not prevent losses, particularly during periods in which the local,\nregional or national economy suffers a general decline. If borrowers fail to repay their loans, our financial condition and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe Company’s mortgage revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions,\ndecreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our profits.\nThe Bank originates residential mortgage loans through Primis Mortgage Company which lends to borrowers\nnationwide. The success of our mortgage business is dependent upon its ability to originate loans and sell them to investors,\nin each case at or near current volumes. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and\nchanges in economic conditions. Loan production levels may suffer if we experience a slowdown in housing markets,\ntightening credit conditions or increasing interest rates. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer\nrefinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure, or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely\naffect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage activities. As a\nresult, these conditions would also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDeteriorating economic conditions may also cause home buyers to default on their mortgages. In certain cases, where\nwe have originated loans and sold them to investors, we may be required to repurchase loans or provide a financial\nsettlement to investors if it is proven that the borrower failed to provide full and accurate information on, or related to,\ntheir loan application, if appraisals for such properties have not been acceptable or if the loan was not underwritten in\naccordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor. In the ordinary course of business, we record an\nindemnification reserve relating to mortgage loans previously sold based on historical statistics and loss rates. If such\nreserves were insufficient to cover claims from investors, such repurchases or settlements would adversely affect our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\n25\nMarket Risks\nOur profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions in the areas where our operations and loans are\nconcentrated, and our geographic concentration makes us vulnerable to local weather catastrophes, public health issues,\nand other external events, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a mixed market environment with influences from both rural and urban areas. Our profitability depends\non the general economic conditions in our market areas of Northern Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Charlottesville,\nNorthern Neck, Middle Peninsula, Richmond, Hampton Roads and the surrounding areas. Unlike larger banks that are\nmore geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to clients primarily in these market areas. As\nof December 31, 2023, a significant portion of our commercial real estate, real estate construction and residential real\nestate loans were made to borrowers in our market area. The local economic conditions in this area have a significant\nimpact on our commercial, real estate and construction and consumer loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these\nloans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. In addition, if the population or income growth in these market\nareas slows, stops or declines, income levels, deposits and housing starts could be adversely affected and could result in\nthe curtailment of our expansion, growth and profitability. Political conditions could also impact our earnings.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject us to significant risk from changes in\ninterest rates. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions\nand the policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory agencies. Like most financial institutions,\nchanges in interest rates can impact our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities, which is\nthe difference between interest earned from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest\npaid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect that we will periodically experience “gaps”\nin the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more\nsensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest\nrates should move contrary to our position, this “gap” will negatively impact our earnings.\nBased on our analysis of the interest rate sensitivity of our assets, an increase in the general level of interest rates may\nnegatively affect the market value of the portfolio equity as well as negatively affect our net interest income since a\nmajority of our assets are fixed rate loans. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the\ndemand for loans and our ability to originate loans as well as increase our funding costs. A decrease in the general level\nof interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed\nsecurities portfolios, but also allow us to reduce funding costs. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates\naffect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios,\nfunding, and our overall results. While it is not expected that the FRB will continue to increase the target federal funds\nrate in 2024 to combat recent inflationary trends as it did in 2023, we are unable to predict changes in interest rates, which\nare affected by factors beyond our control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and\nother changes in financial markets.\nAlthough our asset liability management strategy is designed to keep our risk within acceptable parameters, it may not\nbe able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nUnstable global economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, and\noperations.\nWe are operating in an uncertain economic environment. The global credit and financial markets have experienced\nextreme volatility and disruptions over the past few years, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,\ndeclines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, high rates of inflation,\nand uncertainty about economic stability and a potential recession. The U.S. government’s decisions regarding its debt\nceiling and the possibility that the U.S. could default on its debt obligations may cause further interest rate increases,\ndisrupt access to capital markets, and deepen recessionary conditions. While our management team continually monitors\nmarket conditions and economic factors, throughout our footprint, we are unable to predict the duration or severity of such\n26\nconditions or factors. If conditions were to worsen nationally, regionally, or locally, then we could see a sharp increase in\nour total net charge-offs and also be required to significantly increase our allowance for credit losses. Furthermore, the\ndemand for loans and our other products and services could decline. An increase in our non-performing assets and related\nincreases in our provision for loan losses, coupled with a potential decrease in the demand for loans and other products\nand services, could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and future growth. Our clients may also be adversely impacted by changes in regulatory,\ntrade (including tariffs), and tax policies and laws, all of which could reduce demand for loans and adversely impact our\nborrowers’ ability to repay our loans.\nThere can be no assurance that further deterioration in markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur.\nOur general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn or recession, volatile business\nenvironment, hostile third-party action, or continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. The effects of any\neconomic downturn or recession could continue for many years after the downturn or recession is considered to have\nended.\nDeclines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investment securities,\nfinancial performance and capital.\nWe maintain an investment securities portfolio that includes, but is not limited to, collateralized mortgage obligations,\nagency mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. The market value of investment securities may be affected\nby factors other than the underlying performance of the issuer or composition of the bonds themselves, such as ratings\ndowngrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities. At\neach reporting period, we evaluate investment securities and other assets for impairment indicators. We may be required\nto record impairment charges in our income statements through an allowance for credit losses if our investment securities\nsuffer a decline in value below their amortized cost. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we\nincurred an insignificant amount of impairment charges related to credit losses on our investment securities. If in future\nperiods we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to charge against earnings the\ncredit-related portion of the impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results\nof operations in the periods in which the impairments occur.\nA portion of our income on a portfolio of consumer loans with promotional features is due from a third-party that\noriginated the loans on our behalf. The value of this estimated reimbursement is recorded in our balance sheet at fair\nvalue as a derivative and actual results and a significant decline in the third-party’s credit risk may impact the value of\nthe derivative and our ability to realize that value which could affect our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe record a derivative asset as of December 31, 2023, which mostly reflects our estimate of the fair value of the\ninterest reimbursement due to us from the third-party loan servicer that manages an unsecured consumer loan portfolio\nwith promotional features for us. This derivative asset reflects the interest anticipated to be waived to borrowers under the\nassumed pre-payment of the borrowers’ loans that the third party will be required to pay to us. The derivative is required\nto be valued at fair value under U.S. GAAP with the use of various assumptions including borrower pre-payment, expected\ncredit losses, and third-party servicer credit risk. Assumptions used to determine the value of the derivative are sensitive\nto various factors not within our control that include borrower repayment risk and the credit risk of the third-party servicer.\nThese assumptions are determined based on the information available to the Company as of each balance sheet date. Actual\nresults that differ significantly from our prior assumptions may result in an inability to realize the value of the derivative\nand require updates to future fair value calculations of the derivative which could result in a significant increase or decrease\nin the derivative value that is recorded in our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you\nfind attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n• actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n27\n• recommendations by securities analysts;\n• operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n• news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n• perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n• new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n• significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments\nby or involving us or our competitors;\n• failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n• changes in valuations of Goodwill and other Intangible Assets;\n• changes in government regulations; and\n• geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts or pandemics.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as\neconomic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease\nregardless of operating results.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, the trading volume is low, and you\nare not assured liquidity with respect to transactions in our common stock. A public trading market having the desired\ncharacteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers\nof our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general\neconomic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock,\nsignificant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall.\nInflation could negatively impact our business, our profitability and our stock price.\nProlonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses,\nincluding increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention, and negatively impacting the\ndemand for our products and services. Additionally, inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and client’s purchasing\npower and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our\nbusiness could be negatively affected by, among other things, decreases in loan collateral values and increased default\nrates leading to credit losses which could decrease our appetite for new credit extensions. These inflationary pressures\ncould result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing our stock price to suffer.\nESG risks could adversely affect our reputation and shareholder, employee, client, and third party relationships and may\nnegatively affect our stock price.\nOur business faces increasing public scrutiny related to ESG activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation\nif we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as DEI, environmental stewardship, including with respect to climate\nchange, human capital management, support for our local communities, corporate governance, and transparency, or fail to\nconsider ESG factors in our business operations.\nFurthermore, as a result of our diverse base of clients and business partners, we may face potential negative publicity\nbased on the identity of our clients or business partners and the public’s (or certain segments of the public’s) view of those\nentities. Such publicity may arise from traditional media sources or from social media and may increase rapidly in size\nand scope. If our client or business partner relationships were to become intertwined in such negative publicity, our ability\nto attract and retain clients, business partners, and employees may be negatively impacted, and our stock price may also\nbe negatively impacted. Additionally, we may face pressure to not do business in certain industries that are viewed as\nharmful to the environment or are otherwise negatively perceived, which could impact our growth.\nAdditionally, investors and shareholder advocates are placing ever increasing emphasis on how corporations address\nESG issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and\nproxy recommendations. We may incur meaningful costs with respect to our ESG efforts and if such efforts are negatively\nperceived, our reputation and stock price may suffer.\n28\nOpe rational Risks\nOur business strategy includes strategic growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively\naffected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy for our business. Our prospects must be considered in light of the\nrisks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies such as the continuing need for\ninfrastructure and personnel, the time and costs inherent in integrating a series of different operations and the ongoing\nexpense of acquiring and staffing new banks or branches. We may not be able to expand our presence in our existing\nmarkets or successfully enter new markets and any expansion could adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to\nmanage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition\nor results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Our ability\nto grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business\nopportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to manage our\ngrowth.\nAlthough there can be no assurance of success or the availability of branch or financial services acquisitions in the\nfuture, we may seek to supplement our internal growth through attractive acquisitions. We cannot predict the number, size\nor timing of acquisitions, or whether any such acquisition will occur at all. Our acquisition efforts have traditionally\nfocused on targeted entities in markets in which we currently operate and markets in which we believe we can compete\neffectively. However, as consolidation of the financial services industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition\ncandidates may increase and, as the number of appropriate targets decreases, the prices for potential acquisitions could\nincrease which could reduce our potential returns, and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities to us. We may\ncompete with other financial services companies for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater\nfinancial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if we\nfail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may\nlose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly and in order to remain competitive, we must\ncontinue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes\nmay be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate.\nNew lines of business, products or services and technological advancements may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of\nbusiness. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the\nmarkets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we\ninvest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business\nand/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External\nfactors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact\nthe successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of\nnew technology-driven products and services (including those related to or involving artificial intelligence, machine\nlearning, blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies), and an established and growing demand for mobile and\nother phone and computer banking applications. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs\nof our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to\ncreate additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in\ntechnological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services\n29\nor be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, our implementation of certain new\ntechnologies, such as those related to artificial intelligence, automation and algorithms, in our business processes may\nhave unintended consequences due to their limitations or our failure to use them effectively. In addition, cloud technologies\nare also critical to the operation of our systems, and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Failure to successfully\nkeep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, any new line of business, new product or service and/or new technology could have a significant impact\non the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and\nimplementation of new lines of business, new products or services and/or new technologies could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions or to realize the anticipated benefits of them.\nA successful integration of each acquired business with ours will depend substantially on our ability to successfully\nconsolidate operations, corporate cultures, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. While we\nhave substantial experience in successfully integrating institutions we have acquired, we may encounter difficulties during\nintegration, such as:\n• the loss of key employees;\n• the disruption of operations and businesses;\n• loan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss;\n• possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;\n• unexpected issues with expected branch closures; and/or\n• unexpected issues with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit;\nall of which could divert resources from regular banking operations. Additionally, general market and economic\nconditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful merger\nintegrations.\nFurther, we acquire businesses with the expectation that these mergers will result in various benefits including, among\nother things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the combined company, cross\nselling opportunities, technology, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these\nmergers is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate these institutions in an efficient and\neffective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could\nresult in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues\nand diversion of management’s time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand operating results.\nThe carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be adversely affected.\nWhen the Company completes an acquisition, goodwill and other intangible assets are often recorded on the date of\nacquisition as an asset. Current accounting guidance requires goodwill to be tested for impairment, and we perform such\nimpairment analysis at least annually. A significant adverse change in expected future cash flows or sustained adverse\nchange in the value of our common stock could require the asset to become impaired. If impaired, we would incur a charge\nto earnings that would have a significant impact on the results of operations. Our carrying value of goodwill and net\namortizable intangibles were approximately $93.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and\nmonitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. We have selected\nthese third-party vendors carefully and have conducted the due diligence consistent with regulatory guidance and best\npractices. While we have ongoing programs to review third-party vendors and assess risk, we do not control their actions.\n30\nAny problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided\nby a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor,\nfailure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability\nto deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties\nof a third-party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor’s ability to serve us.\nFurthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from\nbreakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create\nsignificant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business\noperations.\nWe face significant cyber and data security risk that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely\naffect our business or reputation and expose us to significant liabilities.\nAs a financial institution, we are under threat of loss due to hacking and cyber-attacks. This risk has increased in\nrecent years, and continues to increase, as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote\nchannels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive\ncustomer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our\naccounts. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, are less\nfrequent but would present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure\nto these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals\nand hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop\nadditional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers. While we have not experienced any material losses\nrelating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, we have been subject to hacking and cyber-attack and\nthere can be no assurance that we will not suffer additional losses in the future.\nDue to changing behaviors since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed a portion of our employees to work\nremotely from their homes on a full-time or hybrid schedule. Technology in employees’ homes may not be as robust as in\nour offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees to be\nmore limited or less reliable than in our offices. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces\nadditional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include greater phishing, malware,\nand other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and\ntelecommunications systems for remote operations, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential\ninformation, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security\nbreach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical\nfunctions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and\ncould seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nThe occurrence of any cyber-attack or information security breach could result in material adverse consequences to\nus including damage to our reputation and the loss of customers. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory\nscrutiny. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to significant liability or other sanctions, including fines and\npenalties or reimbursement of customers adversely affected by security breach. Even if we do not suffer any material\nadverse consequences as a result of other future events, successful attacks or systems failures at the Bank or at other\nfinancial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions including the Bank.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our information\nsecurity procedures and contracts and our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that occurs. In\nrecent years, we have incurred significant expense towards improving the reliability of our systems and their security from\nattack. Nonetheless, there remains the risk that we may be materially harmed by cyber-attacks and information security\nbreaches in the future. Methods used to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing\nsophistication), often are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other\nwell-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be\nunable to address these methods in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventive measures. If such\nan attack or breach does occur, we might not be able to fix it timely or adequately. To the extent that such an attack or\nbreach relates to products or services provided by others, we seek to engage in due diligence and monitoring to limit the\n31\nrisk. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy\nbecomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance\nwith those requirements could also result in additional costs.\nOur business is susceptible to fraud.\nThe Company’s business exposes it to fraud risk from loan and deposit customers, the parties they do business with,\nas well as from employees, contractors and vendors. The Company relies on financial and other data from new and existing\ncustomers which could turn out to be fraudulent when accepting such customers, executing their financial transactions and\nmaking and purchasing loans and other financial assets. In times of increased economic stress the Company is at increased\nrisk of fraud losses. The Company believes it has underwriting and operational controls in place to prevent or detect such\nfraud, but cannot provide assurance that these controls will be effective in detecting fraud or that the Company will not\nexperience fraud losses or incur costs or other damage related to such fraud, at levels that adversely affect financial results\nor reputation. The Company’s lending customers may also experience fraud in their businesses which could adversely\naffect their ability to repay their loans or make use of services. The Company’s and its customers’ exposure to fraud may\nincrease the Company’s financial risk and reputation risk as it may result in unexpected loan losses that exceed those that\nhave been provided for in the allowance for credit losses.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel could impair our relationship with\nour customers and adversely affect our business.\nMany community banks attract customers based on the personal relationships that the banks’ officers and customers\nestablish with each other and the confidence that the customers have in the officers. We significantly depend on the\ncontinued service and performance of our key management personnel. We also believe our management team’s depth and\nbreadth of experience in the banking industry is integral to executing our business plan. The loss of the services of members\nof our senior management team or other key employees or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and other regulators.\nThe federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking\norganization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety\nand soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt\nrules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. In October 2022,\nthe SEC adopted final rules requiring national securities exchanges, including Nasdaq where we are currently listed, to\nestablish new listing standards relating to policies for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation,\nwhich are often referred to as “clawback policies.” The final rules directed U.S. stock exchanges to require listed\ncompanies to implement, disclose and enforce clawback policies to recover excess incentive-based compensation that\ncurrent or former executive officers received based on financial reporting measures that are later restated. In June 2023,\nthe SEC approved the Nasdaq’s proposed clawback listing standards, which now require us and other Nasdaq-listed\ncompanies to (i) adopt and implement a compliant clawback policy; (ii) file the clawback policy as an exhibit to our annual\nreports; and (iii) provide certain disclosures relating to any compensation recovery triggered by the clawback policy. If, as\na result of complying with the new rules, we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary\nto maintain our competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more\nsignificant, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.\nDeposit insurance premiums levied against banks may increase if the number of bank failures increase or the cost of\nresolving failed banks increases.\nThe FDIC maintains a Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) to protect insured depositors in the event of bank failures. The\nDIF is funded by fees assessed on depository institutions insured by the FDIC. Future deposit premiums paid by banks\nwill depend on FDIC rules, which are subject to change, the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank\nfailures. We may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums if market developments change such that the DIF\nbalance is reduced or the FDIC changes its rules to require higher premiums.\n32\nLiquidity Risks\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Our ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our ability to obtain\nfunding for loan originations, working capital, possible acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. An inability to\nraise funds through deposits, borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the sale of loans and other\nsources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. We anticipate that our retail and commercial deposits will\nbe sufficient to meet our funding needs in the foreseeable future. We may rely on deposits obtained through intermediaries,\nFHLB advances, and other wholesale funding sources to obtain the funds necessary to implement our growth strategy.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us\ncould be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general, including\na decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated\nor adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us,\nsuch as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial\nservices industry. Access to liquidity may also be negatively impacted by the value of our securities portfolio, if liquidity\nand/or business strategy necessitate the sales of securities in a loss position. To the extent we are not successful in obtaining\nsuch funding, we will be unable to implement our strategy as planned which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity,\ndefaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current\nand projected business operations and its financial condition and results of operations.\nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial\ninstitutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services\nindustry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may\nin the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was\nclosed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation, or the FDIC, as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital\nCorp. were each swept into receivership. If any parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access deposits with\nanother financial institution, funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a financial institution,\nsuch parties’ credit quality, ability to pay their obligations to us, or to enter into new commercial arrangements requiring\nadditional payments to us could be adversely affected. Uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial\nservices industry. Additionally, confidence in the safety and soundness of regional banks specifically or the banking system\ngenerally could impact where customers choose to maintain deposits, which could materially adversely impact our\nliquidity, loan funding capacity, ability to raise funds, and results of operations. Similar impacts have occurred in the past,\nsuch as during the 2008-2010 financial crisis.\nInflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government\nsecurities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Although the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and\nFederal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25 billion of loans to financial institutions secured by\ncertain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of\nsuch instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for\nimmediate liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. There is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of Treasury,\nFDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of other\nbanks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion.\nAlthough we assess our funding relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources\nand other arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations\ncould be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, our customers, the financial institutions with which we have\narrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others,\n33\nevents such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform our obligations under various types of financial, credit\nor liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets,\nor concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors\ncould involve financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which we or our customers have financial\nor business relationships, but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry\ngenerally.\nAdditionally, we could be impacted by current or future negative perceptions and expectations about the prospects for\nthe financial services industry (including the impact of Moody’s Investors Service’s rating change of the outlook of the\nUS banking system from “stable” to “negative”), which could worsen over time and result in downward pressure on, and\ncontinued or accelerated volatility of, bank securities.\nWe also anticipate increased regulatory scrutiny – in the course of routine examinations and otherwise – and new\nregulations directed towards banks of similar size to the Bank, designed to address the negative developments in the\nbanking industry, all of which may increase the Company’s costs of doing business and reduce its profitability. Among\nother things, there may be an increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition, the level of\nuninsured deposits, losses embedded in the held-to-maturity portion of our securities portfolio, contingent liquidity, CRE\ncomposition and concentration, capital position and our general oversight and internal control structures regarding the\nforegoing. As primarily a commercial bank, the Bank has an elevated degree of uninsured deposits compared to larger\nnational banks or smaller community banks with a stronger focus on retail deposits, and also maintains a robust CRE\nportfolio. As a result, the Bank could face increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators and the investor\ncommunity. In addition, bank failures have and could in the future prompt the FDIC to increase deposit insurance costs.\nIncreases in funding, deposit insurance, or other costs as a result of these types of events have and could in the future\nmaterially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the disruption following these types\nof events have and could in the future generate significant market trading volatility among publicly traded bank holdings\ncompanies and, in particular, regional banks like the Company.\nCapital Adequacy Risks\nFuture growth or operating results may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available, be\navailable on unfavorable terms or may be dilutive.\nPrimis Bank is required by the FRB to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In the event that\nour future operating results erode capital, if the Bank is required to maintain capital in excess of well-capitalized standards,\nor if we elect to expand through loan growth or acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to\nraise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside our control, and on our financial\nperformance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital on favorable terms when needed, or at all.\nIf we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition\nof restrictions on our growth and business. These outcomes could negatively impact our ability to operate or further expand\nour operations through acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches and may result in increases in operating\nexpenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations. In addition, in order to raise additional capital, we may need to issue shares of our common stock that would\ndilute the book value of our common stock and reduce our current shareholders’ percentage ownership interest to the\nextent they do not participate in future offerings.\nWe may issue a new series of preferred stock or debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock and may\ncause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have issued $27.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due\nJanuary 31, 2027 and $60.0 million of fixed-to-floating rate Subordinated Notes due 2030. In the future, we may increase\nour capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities, which may include senior or additional\nsubordinated notes, classes of preferred shares and/or common shares. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to\npreemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Preferred shares and debt, if issued, have a preference on liquidating\ndistributions or a preference on dividend or interest payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the\n34\nholders of our common stock. Future issuances and sales of parity preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances\nand sales could occur, may also cause prevailing market price for our common stock to decline and may adversely affect\nour ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us. Further issuances of our\ncommon stock could be dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock; however, our future ability to pay dividends is subject to\nrestrictions.\nWe declared the first cash dividend on our common stock in February 2012, and each quarter thereafter through 2023.\nThere are a number of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies\nshould pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective\nearnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides\nthat bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s\nability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.\nOur principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock is cash dividends that we receive from the Bank.\nThe payment of dividends by the Bank to us is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal banking laws, regulations\nand authorities. The federal banking statutes prohibit federally insured banks from making any capital distributions\n(including a dividend payment) if, after making the distribution, the institution would be “under capitalized” as defined by\nstatute. In addition, the relevant federal regulatory agencies have authority to prohibit an insured bank from engaging in\nan unsafe or unsound practice, as determined by the agency, in conducting an activity. The payment of dividends could be\ndeemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice, depending on the financial condition of the Bank. Regulatory\nauthorities could impose administratively stricter limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us if such limits\nwere deemed appropriate to preserve certain capital adequacy requirements.\nRegulatory Risks\nWe are heavily regulated by federal and state agencies; changes in laws and regulations or failures to comply with such\nlaws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our financial results.\nWe and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking\nauthorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us and\nthe Bank, and our respective operations. Additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future\nthat could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, bank regulatory authorities have the authority to bring enforcement actions against banks and their holding\ncompanies for unsafe or unsound practices in the conduct of their businesses or for violations of any law, rule or regulation,\nany condition imposed in writing by the appropriate bank regulatory agency or any written agreement with the agency.\nPossible enforcement actions against us could include the issuance of a cease-and-desist order that could be judicially\nenforced, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital or enter into a strategic\ntransaction, whether by merger or otherwise, with a third party, the appointment of a conservator or receiver, the\ntermination of insurance on deposits, the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties,\nand the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders. The exercise of this regulatory discretion\nand power may have a negative impact on us. See the discussion above at Supervision and Regulation for an additional\ndiscussion of the extensive regulation and supervision the Company and the Bank are subject to.\nAs a regulated entity, Primis and the Bank must maintain certain required levels of regulatory capital that may limit our\noperations and potential growth.\nAs further described above under Supervision and Regulation—Capital Requirements, Primis and the Bank each are\nsubject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the FRB.\n35\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional, discretionary\nactions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank’s and our consolidated financial\nstatements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must\nmeet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance\nsheet commitments as calculated under these regulations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Primis and the Bank exceeded the amounts required to be well capitalized with respect to\nall four required capital ratios. As of December 31, 2023, Primis’ leverage, CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital and Total risk-based capital ratios were 8.37%, 8.96%, 9.25%, and 13.44%, respectively. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Bank’s leverage, CET1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and Total risk-based capital ratios were 9.80%,\n10.88%, 10.88% and 12.12%, respectively.\nMany factors affect the calculation of Primis and the Bank’s risk-based assets and its ability to maintain the level of\ncapital required to achieve acceptable capital ratios. For example, changes in risk weightings of assets relative to capital\nand other factors may combine to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets in the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the\nTotal risk-based capital ratio. Any increases in its risk-weighted assets will require a corresponding increase in its capital\nto maintain the applicable ratios. In addition, recognized loan losses in excess of amounts reserved for such losses, loan\nimpairments, impairment losses on investment securities and other factors will decrease the Bank’s capital, thereby\nreducing the level of the applicable ratios.\nPrimis and the Bank’s failure to remain well capitalized for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence,\nour ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, our\nability to make acquisitions, and on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Under FRB rules, if the\nBank ceases to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that it pays on deposits and\nits ability to accept, renew or rollover brokered deposits may be restricted. As of December 31, 2023, we had $75.0 million\nof brokered certificates of deposits.\nWe are subject to commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators that impacts our\noperations and capital requirements.\nThe federal banking regulators have issued final guidance regarding concentrations in commercial real estate lending\ndirected at institutions that have particularly high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within their lending\nportfolios. This guidance suggests that institutions whose commercial real estate loans exceed certain percentages of\ncapital should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk and may be required\nto maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Based on\nour commercial real estate concentration as of December 31, 2023, we believe that we are operating within the guidelines.\nHowever, increases in our commercial real estate lending could subject us to additional supervisory analysis. We cannot\nguarantee that any risk management practices we implement will be effective to prevent losses relating to our commercial\nreal estate portfolio. Management has implemented controls to monitor our commercial real estate lending concentrations,\nbut we cannot predict the extent to which this guidance will continue to impact our operations or capital requirements.\nChanges in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results\nof operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our\nassets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective\nand complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. If those assumptions, estimates or judgments were\nincorrectly made, we may be required to correct and restate prior-period financial statements. Accounting standard-setters\nand those who interpret the accounting standards, the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public\naccounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards\nshould be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report our financial\nstatements. In some cases, we may be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in us revising\nprior-period financial statements.\n36\nFin ancial Reporting Risks\nFailure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition and could impact the price of our common stock.\nFailure to maintain an effective internal control environment could result in us not being able to accurately report our\nfinancial results, prevent or detect fraud, or provide timely and reliable financial information pursuant to our reporting\nobligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, it could cause our investors to lose confidence in the financial information we report, which could affect the\ntrading price of our common stock.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions\nand can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or\ncircumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the year end December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknessess in its internal controls over\nfinancial reporting related to (i) properly assessing the accounting treatment for certain loan transfer transactions, (ii)\nproperly assessing the accounting treatment for an agreement with a third-party to originate and manage a portfolio of\nconsumer loans, and (iii) a process to evaluate expected credit losses on its third-party originated and managed consumer\nloan portfolio. Management also identified a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting related to\n(ii) above during the year ended December 31, 2022. Management is currently remediating the material weaknesses\nincluding design of and testing new controls related to the accounting and disclosure for these items. If management fails\nto timely and effectively remediate the deficiency in its control environment for these accounting issues it could result in\nadditional incorrect accounting application to similar transactions in the future which may have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nPrimis Financial Corp. does not have any unresolved staff comments from the SEC to report for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nThe Bank’s information security program is designed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, use,\ndisclosure, alteration, or destruction, and to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information\nassets, including employee and customer non-public information, financial data, and internal operational information. Our\nChief Information Officer (“CIO”) manages our information security strategy and development as overseen by our\noverarching Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program. On January 16, 2024, G. Cody Sheflett, Jr., CIO of the\nCompany, passed away. The Company has actively engaged a recruiting firm to fill the CIO vacancy, but has not formally\nappointed a new CIO. During such vacancy, the Company has appointed an interim CIO and unless otherwise noted,\nreferences to the CIO and his duties refer to Mr. Sheflett’s historical role and the interim CIO’s role, and the duties and\nobligations the Company anticipates the next CIO to abide by. The Company’s interim CIO has worked in the financial\nservices industry for over 20 years and held similar roles at other financial institutions including four years as a Chief\nInformation Officer and five years as a Chief Technology Officer.\n37\nThe Bank’s cybersecurity program, including our information security policies, is designed to align with regulatory\nguidance and industry practices. To protect our information systems, network, and information assets from cybersecurity\nthreats, we use various security tools, products, and processes that help identify, prevent, investigate, and remediate\ncybersecurity threats and security incidents.\nThe Bank’s Network Team monitors threat intelligence sources to research evolving threats, investigates the potential\nimpact to financial services companies, examines company controls to detect and defend against those threats, and\nproactively adjusts company defenses against those threats. The Network Team also actively monitors company networks\nand systems to detect suspicious or malicious events, and contracts with third-party consultants to perform penetration\ntesting and routine vulnerability scans. A managed security service provider supplements our efforts to provide 24 hours\na day, seven days a week coverage.\nWe maintain policies and procedures for the safe storage, handling, and secure disposal of customer information. Each\nemployee is expected to be responsible for the security and confidentiality of customer information, and we communicate\nthis responsibility to employees upon hiring and regularly throughout their employment. Annually, we provide employees\nwith mandatory security awareness training. The curriculum includes the recognition and appropriate handling of potential\nphishing emails, which could place sensitive customer or employee information at risk. The Company employs a number\nof technical controls to mitigate the risk of phishing emails targeting employees. We test employees monthly to determine\ntheir susceptibility to phishing test emails, and we require susceptible employees to take additional training and provide\nregular reports to management.\nAs part of our information security program, we have adopted a Cyber Incident Response Plan (“Incident Response\nPlan”) which is administered by our CIO who closely coordinates with the Bank’s Information Technology team. The\nIncident Response Plan describes the Bank’s processes, procedures, and responsibilities for responding to cybersecurity\nincidents, and identifies those team members responsible for assessing potential security incidents, declaring an incident,\nand initiating a response. The Incident Response Plan outlines action steps for investigating, containing, and remediating\na cybersecurity incident, and includes procedures for escalation and reporting of potentially significant cybersecurity\nincidents to the Bank’s Senior Leadership Team, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer\n(“CFO”), Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), and the Board of Directors. As necessary, the Company may retain a third-party\nfirm to assist with forensic investigation and management of cybersecurity incidents.\nThe Bank conducts due diligence prior to engaging third-party service providers which have access to the Bank’s\nnetworks, systems, and/or customer or employee data. Risk assessments are performed using Service Organization\nControls (SOC) reports, self-attestation questionnaires, and other tools. Third-party service providers are required to\ncomply with the Bank’s policies regarding non-public personal information and information security. Third parties\nprocessing non-public personal information are contractually required to meet all legal and regulatory obligations to protect\ncustomer data against security threats or unauthorized access. After contract execution, Primis requires critical and high-\nrisk providers to have an ongoing monitoring plan.\nWhile we do not believe that our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition have been materially\nadversely affected by any cybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity threats are pervasive, and cybersecurity risk has increased\nin recent years. Despite our efforts, there can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management processes and\nmeasures described will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information. We\nface risks from certain cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy,\nresult of operations or financial condition. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Operational Risks” of this report for additional\ninformation.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s business and affairs, including risks associated with\ncybersecurity threats. The ERM Committee (“ERMC”) of the Board has primary responsibility for overseeing the Bank’s\ncomprehensive ERM program, including its cybersecurity program. The ERM program assists senior leadership team in\n38\nidentifying, assessing, monitoring, and managing risk, including cybersecurity risk, in a rapidly changing environment.\nCybersecurity matters and assessments are regularly included in both Audit Committee (“AC”) and ERMC meetings.\nThe Board’s oversight of cybersecurity risk is supported by our CIO. The CIO attends ERMC meetings and provides\ncybersecurity updates to these Board committees on a quarterly basis. Our CRO, in conjunction with our CIO, facilitates\nthe involvement of the ERMC in oversight of potentially significant cybersecurity incidents. The Executive Vice President\nand Chief Financial Officer and the Network Manager have been attending the ERMC meetings in the CIO’s absence.\nThe Bank’s CIO directs the Bank’s information security program and our information technology risk management.\nIn this role, in addition to the responsibilities discussed above, the CIO manages the Bank’s information security and day-\nto-day cybersecurity operations and supports the information security risk oversight responsibilities of the Board and its\ncommittees. The CIO is also responsible for the Bank’s information technology governance, risk, and compliance program\nand ensures that high level risks receive appropriate attention. Led by our CIO, the Network Team examines risks to the\nBank’s information systems and assets, designs and implements security solutions, monitors the environment, and provides\nresponses to threats. Our CRO has over three decades of experience in risk management, and our Network Team\ncollectively has over 19 years of experience in cybersecurity operations.\nItem 2. Properties\nPrimis Financial Corp.’s principal office is located at 1676 International Drive, McLean, Virginia. The Company has\nan administrative office in Glen Allen, Virginia and an operations center in Atlee, Virginia. Including these main locations,\nour bank owns 30 properties and leases 24 properties, all of which are used as branch locations or for housing operational\nunits in Maryland and Virginia. As of December 31, 2023, Primis Bank had twenty-four full-service branches in Virginia\nand Maryland and also provided services to customers through certain online and mobile applications. Twenty-two full-\nservice retail branches are in Virginia and two full-service retail branches are in Maryland.\nPrimis believes its facilities are in good operating condition, are suitable and adequate for its operational needs and are\nadequately insured.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nPrimis and Primis Bank are from time to time a party, as both plaintiff and defendant, to various claims and proceedings\narising in the ordinary course of our business, including administrative and/or legal proceedings that may include\nemployment-related claims, as well as claims of lender liability, breach of contract, and other similar lending-related\nclaims. While the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be determined at this time, the Bank’s management presently\nbelieves that such matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition or results of operations. There are no proceedings pending, or to management’s knowledge, threatened, that\nrepresent a significant risk against Primis or Primis Bank as of December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nCommon Stock Market Prices\nPrimis’ common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “FRST”. There were 24,708,234\nshares of our common stock outstanding at the close of business on September 16, 2024, which were held by 1,133\nshareholders of record. As of that date, the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market was $10.48.\n39\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nAs of December 31, 2023, Primis had outstanding stock options granted under the 2010 Stock Awards and Incentive\nPlan (the “2010 Plan”) and the 2017 Equity Compensation Plan (the “2017 Plan”), which were approved by its\nshareholders. The following table provides information as of December 31, 2023 regarding Primis’ equity compensation\nplans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance:\nNumber of securities\nremaining available for\nfuture issuance under\nNumber of securities Weighted average equity compensation plans\nto be issued upon exercise exercise price of (excluding securities reflected\nof outstanding options outstanding options in column A)\nPlan category A B C\nEquity compensation plans approved by security\nholders 54,800 $ 11.49 370,582\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security\nholders — — —\nTotal 54,800 $ 11.49 370,582\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nDividends\nWe declared the first cash dividend on our common stock in February 2012, and each quarter thereafter through 2023.\nThere are a number of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies\nshould pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective\nearnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides\nthat bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s\nability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital\nlevels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to Primis or by Primis to shareholders. The Company’s ability to pay\ndividends to stockholders is largely dependent upon the dividends it receives from the Bank, and the Bank is subject to\nregulatory limitations on the amount of cash dividends it may pay.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following chart compares the cumulative total shareholder return on Primis common stock during the five years\nended December 31, 2023, with the cumulative total return of the Russell 2000 Index and the NASDAQ Bank Index for\nthe same period.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nItem 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses year-to-year comparisons between the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. Discussions of comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included in this Form10-K but\ncan be found in “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\nour restated Annual Report on Form10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2022 as filed with the SEC on October 4,\n2024.\nManagement’s discussion and analysis is presented to aid the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial\ncondition and results of operations of Primis. This discussion and analysis should be read with the consolidated financial\nstatements, the footnotes thereto, and the other financial data included in this report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES\nWe follow accounting and reporting policies that conform, in all material respects, to accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. and to general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. While we base estimates\non historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those\nestimates.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if (i) the accounting estimate requires\nmanagement to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and (ii) different estimates that management\nreasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that\nare reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nAllowance for credit losses\nAccounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses on financial instruments including loans and off-balance-\nsheet credit exposures are considered to be critical as these policies involve considerable subjective judgment and\nestimation by management. In the case of loans, the allowance for credit losses is a contra-asset valuation account,\ncalculated in accordance with ASC 326, which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected.\nIn the case of off-balance-sheet credit exposures, the allowance for credit losses is a liability account, calculated in\naccordance with ASC 326. The allowance is reported as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAdjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of other expenses.\nThe amount of each allowance account represents management’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on\nthese financial instruments considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing\nexposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument. We consider a number of external economic variables\nin developing the allowance including the Virginia Unemployment Rate, Virginia House Price Index (“HPI”), Virginia\nGross Domestic Product (“GDP”), and, National Unemployment and National Gross Domestic Product for pools of loans\nwith borrowers outside of our local operating footprint. In determining forecasted expected losses, we use Moody’s\neconomic variable forecasts and apply probability weights to the related economic scenarios.We also use internal factors\nincluding loan balances, credit quality, contractual life of loans, and historical loss experience. While historical credit loss\nexperience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, adjustments to historical loss information may\nbe made for differences in current portfolio-specific risk characteristics, environmental conditions or other relevant factors.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect\nof matters that are inherently uncertain. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the\nultimate adequacy of our allowance accounts is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the\nperformance of our portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward\n42\nclassification of assets. Further, subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of factors existing at\nthe time of subsequent evaluation may result in significant changes to the allowance.\nGoodwill\nAs required under U.S. GAAP, we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if there are\nindications that goodwill could be impaired. Our annual goodwill impairment testing date is September 30 and accordingly,\nwe performed testing as of September 30, 2023 of our two reporting units that include goodwill. For our assessment of\ngoodwill as of September 30, 2023, we performed a step one quantitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the\nPrimis Bank and the Primis Mortgage reporting units were less than their carrying amount. As part of the testing, we\nengaged an independent valuation firm to quantitatively estimate the fair value of each reporting unit so that it could be\ncompared to the carrying value in assisting us in determining if impairment existed. The results of the quantitative\nassessment of the Primis Mortgage reporting unit indicated that its fair value was in excess of its carrying value, thus no\ngoodwill impairment was necessary.\nOur assessment of the Primis Bank reporting unit included the use of three approaches, each receiving various\nweightings to determine an ultimate fair value estimate: (1) the comparable transactions method that is based on\ncomparison to pricing ratios recently paid in the sale or merger of comparable banking institutions; (2) the public market\npeers control premium approach that is based on market pricing ratios of public banking companies adjusted for an industry\nbased control premium, and (3) a discounted cash flow method (an income method), taking into consideration expectations\nof the Company’s growth and profitability going forward. The assessment included use of various assumptions and inputs\ninto the modeling approaches, including creating a baseline and conservative scenarios that stressed certain assumptions\nsuch as projected cash flows and the discount rate. We considered the modeled results of each scenario and in light of the\nsustained depressed stock price in the months leading up to our impairment testing as of September 30, 2023 compared to\nour book value we determined it was reasonable to leverage the results of a scenario that utilized more stressed inputs and\nassumptions. Ultimately, in third quarter of 2023, the result of the quantitative assessment indicated the Primis Bank\nreporting unit’s book value was more than its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we took an impairment charge to Primis\nBank’s goodwill of $11.2 million which is reflected in our noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and\nfactors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill\nimpairment testing as of September 30, 2023 will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Changes in assumptions,\nmarket data (for market-based assessments), or the discount rate (for income based assessments) could produce different\nresults that lead to higher or lower fair value determinations compared to the results of our annual impairment testing\nperformed as of September 30, 2023. Further, because the use of inputs and assumptions are highly judgmental an analysis\nperformed to assess the fair value of our reporting units by others may results in higher, lower, or the same fair value\ndetermination and goodwill impairment decision through the use of their judgment in application of similar inputs and\nassumptions as we used.\nThird-party originated and serviced consumer loan portfolio\nIn the second half of 2021, we partnered with a third-party (the “Third Party Originator/Servicer” or “TPOS”) to\noriginate and service unsecured consumer loans through their proprietary point-of-sale technology (the “Consumer\nProgram”). Loan options under the Consumer Program include traditional fully-amortizing loans and promotional loans\nwith no interest, or “same-as-cash”, features if the loan is fully repaid in the promotional window. The loans are originated\nat par in the Bank’s name and have a term of 5 to 12 years with a much shorter effective life due to amortization and pay\ndowns.\nThe Consumer Program is governed by multiple interrelated agreements including the loan agreement between the\nBank and the customer and agreements with the TPOS. The structure of the Consumer Program is intended to generate\n43\nloans that yield a targeted return to the Bank on a portfolio basis while also providing limited credit enhancement from the\nTPOS. Key characteristics of the combined arrangement include:\n• The TPOS contributes funds to a reserve account at the time of origination to be used for future charge-offs\nif necessary.\n• When a promotional loan pays off prior to the end of the promotional period, the customer owes no interest\non the loan and any interest accrued during the period is waived. In that event, the TPOS reimburses the Bank\nfor the interest the customer otherwise would have paid if the promotional period didn’t exist.\n• Excess yield on the portfolio after realized charge-offs and above an agreed upon target rate due to the Bank\nis paid to the TPOS as a “performance fee.”\n• In the event charge-offs exceed the amount available as a performance fee, the TPOS remits a portion of\ncurrent period originations to reimburse for losses and, if necessary, releases funds from the reserve account.\n• If charge-offs exceed the amounts above, they roll over to future periods to offset potential performance fees\nand subsequent reserve account fundings related to the portfolio.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, agreements with multiple counterparties, such as the customer and TPOS, are generally required\nto be accounted for separately even if the agreements are highly interrelated. As a result, we account for the Consumer\nProgram under multiple units of account with the following impacts:\n• The loans are accounted for as one unit of account under U.S. GAAP including revenue recognition and\ninclusion in our CECL allowance methodology.\no No interest income is recognized on promotional loans until the expiration of the promotional period.\nIf the customer doesn’t pay off the loan prior to that expiration, deferred interest from the beginning\nof the loan becomes the obligation of the customer and is billed straight-line over the remaining life\nof the loan. We recognize the accumulated deferred interest at the time of expiration discounted for\nthe time value of money with the discount amortized over the remaining life of the loan.\n• The agreement that governs the “performance fee” and interest reimbursement from the TPOS is a separate\nunit of account and meets the definition of a derivative under U.S. GAAP and is accounted for at fair value in\nour financial statements. The primary drivers of the derivative value include estimated prepayment activity\non promotional loans that would trigger reimbursement from the TPOS to us and estimated excess yield above\nprojected credit losses that would lead to performance fee payments from us to the TPOS. The credit risk of\nthe third-party and discount rates used in the calculation also impact the value of the derivative. Changes in\nthe fair value of the derivative are recorded as gains or losses in noninterest income. Additional details on the\ninputs to the derivative value can be found in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 -\nDerivatives in this Form 10-K.\n• Noninterest income each period includes actual amounts received during the period for interest reimbursement\nand amounts paid by the TPOS under the limited credit enhancement described above.\n• Noninterest expense each period includes actual amounts paid during the period for performance fees and\nservicing fees as defined in our agreement with the TPOS.\nWe have $199.3 million of loans outstanding in the Consumer Program, or 6% of our total gross loan portfolio, as of\nDecember 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, 45% of the loans were in a promotional period requiring no payment of\ninterest on their loans with 70% of these promotional loan periods ending in the second half of 2024 through the first\nquarter of 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2023, $10.1 million of promotional loans paid off prior to the end\n44\nof their promotional periods while $4.8 million of promotional loans reached the end of the promotional period and entered\namortization.\nOVERVIEW\nPrimis Financial Corp. (“Primis,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is the bank holding company for Primis Bank\n(“Primis Bank” or the “Bank”), a Virginia state-chartered bank which commenced operations on April 14, 2005. Primis\nBank provides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses. At December 31, 2023,\nPrimis Bank had twenty-four full-service branches in Virginia and Maryland and also provides services to customers\nthrough certain online and mobile applications.

The 155.3% decrease in the net income attributable to common shareholders during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily related to a $11.2 million goodwill\nimpairment charge taken in the third quarter of 2023 and $20.9 million of provision for credit losses on the Consumer\nProgram loan portfolio. The decrease was also driven by higher noninterest expenses from an increase in employee\ncompensation and benefits expense due to the growth of Primis Mortgage and the Panacea Financial division of the Bank,\nhigher data processing, and FDIC insurance assessment expense driven by the increase in customer accounts and related\ntransactions on our digital deposit platform. These expenses were partially offset by higher interest income on our loan\nportfolio due to average loan growth of $600 million along with higher interest rates in 2023, mortgage banking income\ndue to the growth of Primis Mortgage, an increase in interest earned on other earnings assets, and increased derivative\ngains primarily driven by the increase in the derivative asset related to the Consumer Program loan portfolio.\nNet Interest Income\nOur operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest and dividend\nincome on interest-earning assets such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such\nas deposits and borrowings.\n46\nThe following table details average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the amount of\ninterest earned/paid on such assets and liabilities, and the yield/rate for the periods indicated:\nA verage B ala nce Shee ts a n d Net Inter es t M argin\nAnalysis For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nInterest Interest\nAverage Income/ Yield/ Average Income/ Yield/\nBalance Expense Rate Balance Expense Rate\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nAssets\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans held for sale $ 44,643 $ 2,806 6.29 % $ 12,722 $ 705 5.54 %\nLoans, net of deferred fees (1) (2) 3,126,717 169,982 5.44 % 2,590,635 114,375 4.41 %\nInvestment securities 237,452 6,373 2.68 % 278,162 5,964 2.14 %\nOther earning assets 281,052 13,457 4.79 % 200,828 2,243 1.12 %\nTotal earning assets 3,689,864 192,618 5.22 % 3,082,347 123,287 4.00 %\nAllowance for credit losses (35,382) (30,236)\nTotal non-earning assets 296,647 264,388\nTotal assets $ 3,951,129 $ 3,316,499\nLiabilities and stockholders’ equity\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nNOW and other demand accounts $ 784,680 $ 15,404 1.96 % $ 698,907 $ 2,303 0.33 %\nMoney market accounts 831,196 23,717 2.85 % 807,330 6,357 0.79 %\nSavings accounts 777,143 29,774 3.83 % 224,755 737 0.33 %\nTime deposits 474,178 14,795 3.12 % 350,720 3,884 1.11 %\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,867,197 83,690 2.92 % 2,081,712 13,281 0.64 %\nBorrowings 159,442 10,217 6.41 % 193,050 8,306 4.30 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 3,026,639 93,907 3.10 % 2,274,762 21,587 0.95 %\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand deposits 495,107 614,285\nOther liabilities 35,494 24,285\nTotal liabilities 3,557,240 2,913,332\nPrimis common stockholders’ equity 393,302 403,167\nNoncontrolling interest 587 —\nTotal stockholders’ equity 393,889 403,167\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 3,951,129 $ 3,316,499\nNet interest income $ 98,711 $ 101,700\nInterest rate spread 2.12 % 3.05 %\nNet interest margin 2.68 % 3.30 %\n(1) Includes loan fees in both interest income and the calculation of the yield on loans.\n(2) Calculations include non-accruing loans in average loan amounts outstanding.\nNet interest income was $98.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $101.7 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022. Primis’ net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 2.68%, compared to\n3.30% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The combination in the industry of rapid increase in deposit account rates\nand consumer preferences shifting from non-interest bearing to higher rate products impacted interest expense and net\ninterest income during 2023. Total income on interest-earning assets was $192.6 million and $123.3 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, driven by average interest-earning asset growth of $607.5 million. The\nyield on average interest-earning assets was 5.22% and 4.00% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Increase in yield on average interest-earnings assets was driven by higher rates on cash and loans in 2023\ncompared to 2022. Net interest margin was further affected by excess cash balances during the first half of the year that\nare part of average other earning assets but do not contribute meaningfully to net interest income. Beginning on June 30,\n2023 we began to sweep that excess cash to other financial institutions by participating in a program that supports our\ndeposit customers desire to obtain maximum insurance coverage on their cash deposits while also allowing us to manage\ncash balances and interest expense exposure. Average loans during the year ended December 31, 2023 were $3.1 billion,\ncompared to $2.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. The $0.5 billion increase in average loans combined\nwith the 103 basis point increase in yield on the loan portfolio drove the $55.6 million increase in income on loans. The\ncost of average interest-bearing deposits increased 228 basis points to 2.92% for the year ended December 31, 2023,\n47\ncompared to 0.64% for the year ended December 31, 2022 as average interest-bearing liabilities grew approximately\n$751.9 million and the rates paid on these liabilities grew significantly due to the consistent increases in benchmark interest\nrates during the year. The increase was driven by higher costs in every interest-bearing category with the largest driver\nbeing an increase in average savings deposits of $552.5 million with an average increase in cost of those deposits of 3.50%.\nThis increase was primarily a result of the aforementioned growth of the digital deposit platform and increase in benchmark\ninterest rates.\nThe following table summarizes changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volume of interest-\nearning assets and interest-bearing liabilities compared to changes in interest rates. The change in interest, due to both\nrate and volume, has been proportionately allocated between rate and volume.\nY ear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 vs. 2022\nIncrease (Decrease)\nDue to Change in:\nNet\nVolume Rate Change\n(in thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans held for sale $ 2,006 $ 95 $ 2,101\nLoans, net of deferred fees 29,434 26,173 55,607\nInvestment securities (1,626) 2,035 409\nOther earning assets 1,225 9,989 11,214\nTotal interest-earning assets 31,039 38,292 69,331\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nNOW and other demand accounts 320 12,781 13,101\nMoney market accounts 215 17,145 17,360\nSavings accounts 5,467 23,570 29,037\nTime deposits 1,783 9,128 10,911\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 7,785 62,624 70,409\nBorrowings (1,060) 2,971 1,911\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 6,726 65,594 72,320\nChange in net interest income $ 24,314 $ (27,303) $ (2,989)\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses is a current charge to earnings made in order to adjust the allowance for credit losses\nfor current expected losses in the loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio characteristics, current\neconomic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of lending, historical loan experience and other known internal\nand external factors affecting loan collectability, and assessment of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future\neconomic conditions that would impact collectability of the loans. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated by\nsegmenting the loan portfolio by loan type and applying risk factors to each segment. The risk factors are determined by\nconsidering historical loss data, peer data, as well as applying management’s judgment.\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $32.5 million and $11.3 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The provision included amounts calculated in our normal reserve process for\nthe Consumer Program loans which totaled $29.4 million and $3.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. We had charge-offs totaling $16.7 million and $8.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, $8.8 million of charge-offs were related to the\nConsumer Program and a majority of the remaining charge-offs were related to the resolution of the assisted living\nrelationship that was originally placed on nonaccrual and reserved for in 2022 and which underwent a receiver-managed\nmarketing process that ended in 2023. There were recoveries totaling $1.8 million and $2.2 million during year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n48\nOur provision for credit losses during 2023 was driven by provisions related to the Consumer Program loan portfolio.\nThis portfolio began to experience higher losses in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily centered around loans originated\nfrom the third quarter 2022 through the first quarter of 2023. Losses on these vintages in 2023 was $7.0 million, or 79%\nof total losses on the Consumer Program loan portfolio in 2023. Higher loss rates continued to be seen on these vintages\nduring 2024 through the date we filed this Form 10-K. As a result, we updated the credit loss experience in our allowance\nmodels as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, on this loan portfolio to incorporate the continued higher losses\nseen subsequent to year end which resulted in an additional $18.2 million in provision recorded during 2023.\nThe Financial Condition Section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) provides information on\nour loan portfolio, past due loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for credit losses.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents the categories of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nFor th e Year End ed\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nAccount maintenance and deposit service fees $ 5,733 $ 5,745 $ (12)\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance 2,021 1,994 27\nMortgage banking income 17,645 5,054 12,591\nGain on other investments 184 4,709 (4,525)\nConsumer Program derivative 18,120 65 18,055\nOther noninterest income 1,547 785 762\nTotal noninterest income $ 45,250 $ 18,352 $ 26,898\nNoninterest income increased 147% to $45.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $18.4 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in noninterest income was primarily related to $12.6 million of higher\nmortgage banking income and $18.1 million in income on the Consumer Program derivative during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase in the mortgage banking income is related to a full year of Primis Mortgage’s results in\n2023 compared to only seven months in 2022 (acquisition date of May 31, 2022), coupled with meaningful growth in the\nbusiness since the purchase. Mortgage banking income includes fair value adjustments, origination income, and gains on\nsales of mortgage loans held for sale. Primis Mortgage originated and sold $572.2 million of loans in 2023, compared to\nonly $169.2 million in the seven months of 2022 after the acquisition, which drove the increase in origination income and\ngains on sales in 2023. The Consumer Program derivative is comprised of $11.3 million of fair value adjustment gains on\nthe derivative asset and $6.8 million of realized gains on the derivative in 2023. The derivative asset and related gains are\ndriven by anticipated cash payments due to us from the third-party when borrowers prepay their loans in a no-interest\npromotional period. During 2023, the value of the derivative and related gains were driven by the $52.3 million of loans\nwith a no-interest promotional period originated early in the year. The majority of the loans originated with a promotional\nperiod will end their promotional period between the third quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2025. The realized\ngains are a result of borrowers paying off their promotional period loans before the end of the promotional period which\ntriggers payment from the derivative counterparty of the interest accrued during the promotional period, which totaled\n$2.4 million. Also included in the realized income is $4.4 million of income related to the third party’s reimbursement\nunder the agreement of credit losses incurred on the loans during the year Additional details of this derivative and the\ncomponents of the realized income, including assumptions used to value the derivative, are described in the Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Policies section of this MD&A. The increase in noninterest income was partially offset by\ngains on the sale of an other equity investment in the prior year that did not reoccur in the current year.\n49\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table present the major categories of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 (in thousands):\nFor th e Year End ed\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nSalaries and benefits $ 58,765 $ 49,005 $ 9,760\nOccupancy expenses 6,239 5,628 611\nFurniture and equipment expenses 6,381 5,231 1,150\nAmortization of core deposit intangible 1,269 1,325 (56)\nVirginia franchise tax expense 3,395 3,254 141\nFDIC insurance assessment 2,929 890 2,039\nData processing expense 9,545 6,013 3,532\nMarketing expense 1,819 3,067 (1,248)\nTelephone and communication expense 1,507 1,433 74\nLoss on bank premises and equipment and assets held for sale 476 684 (208)\nProfessional fees 4,641 4,787 (146)\nMiscellaneous lending expenses 3,006 1,710 1,296\nGoodwill impairment 11,150 — 11,150\nFraud losses 3,311 108 3,203\nOther operating expenses 8,167 8,313 (146)\nTotal noninterest expenses $ 122,600 $ 91,448 $ 31,152\nNoninterest expenses were $122.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $91.4 million during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. The 34.1% increase in noninterest expenses was primarily attributable to $11.2 million\nof goodwill impairment recognized in the third quarter of 2023 and a $9.8 million increase in employee compensation and\nbenefits expense mainly related to increased head count at the Bank that was driven by the Panacea Financial division and\nPrimis Mortgage during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The compensation expense was also higher\nin part due to expenses associated with the branch consolidations in 2023.\nThe increase in noninterest expense during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 was also due to a\n$3.5 million increase in data processing expense in 2023 driven by substantially higher application volume on the digital\ndeposit platform as a result of a savings account rate promotion offered during 2023 that brought in approximately $1.0\nbillion of deposits. Increase in noninterest expenses was also attributable to $2.0 million of higher FDIC insurance costs\nin 2023 compared to 2022 attributable to our higher assessment base as a result of our growth from last year and a 2 basis\npoint increase in the assessment rate by the FDIC starting in the first quarter of 2023. Furniture and equipment expenses\nincreased $1.2 million due to growth in the Bank and Primis Mortgage, and also due to write-downs of assets related to\nthe cost savings initiative and branch consolidations in 2023. Miscellaneous lending expenses was $1.3 million higher and\nwas primarily driven by a $0.9 million increase in servicing costs we pay the third-party that manages the Consumer\nProgram loans which grew from $134.4 million in principal balance of loans at the end of 2022 to $199.3 million at the\nend of 2023. Finally, we experienced $3.3 million in fraud losses in 2023 primarily related to a substantial increase in\ndeposit account fraud that was not isolated to Primis, but was wide-spread across the industry during the year.\n50\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe following illustrates key balance sheet categories as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 Change\nTotal cash and cash equivalents $ 77,553 $ 77,859 $ (306)\nSecurities available-for-sale 228,420 236,315 (7,895)\nSecurities held-to-maturity 11,650 13,520 (1,870)\nLoans held for sale 57,691 27,626 30,065\nNet loans 3,167,205 2,912,093 255,112\nOther assets 314,027 299,251 14,776\nTotal assets $ 3,856,546 $ 3,566,664 $ 289,882\nTotal deposits $ 3,270,155 $ 2,722,467 $ 547,688\nBorrowings 149,032 426,757 (277,725)\nOther liabilities 39,766 28,472 11,294\nTotal liabilities 3,458,953 3,177,696 281,257\nTotal equity 397,593 388,968 8,625\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 3,856,546 $ 3,566,664 $ 289,882\nLoans\nTotal loans were $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. PPP loans totaled $2.0\nmillion and $4.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Excluding PPP loans, loans outstanding increased\n$269.7 million, or 9.2%, since December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, a majority of our loans were to customers located in Virginia and Maryland. We\nare not dependent on any single customer or group of customers whose insolvency would have a material adverse effect\non our operations. Our loan portfolio grew 9% in 2023 which included declines in real estate secured loans and increases\nin commercial and consumer loans. The consumer loan growth was primarily driven by the increase in life insurance\npremium finance loans followed by originations from the third party managed portfolio during 2023. The increase in\ncommercial loans was driven primarily by $30.5 million of commercial loan growth in our Panacea Financial division.\nThese loans are diversified geographically and are spread across the nation.\n51\nThe composition of our loans held for investment portfolio consisted of the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands):\nDecember 3 1, 2023 December 3 1, 2022\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\nLoans secured by real estate:\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied $ 455,397 14.1 % $ 459,866 15.6 %\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied 578,600 18.0 % 579,733 19.7 %\nSecured by farmland 5,044 0.2 % 5,970 0.2 %\nConstruction and land development 164,742 5.1 % 148,690 5.0 %\nResidential 1-4 family 606,226 18.8 % 609,694 20.7 %\nMulti- family residential 127,857 4.0 % 140,321 4.8 %\nHome equity lines of credit 59,670 1.9 % 65,152 2.2 %\nTotal real estate loans 1,997,536 62.0 % 2,009,426 68.2 %\nCommercial loans 602,623 18.7 % 520,741 17.7 %\nPaycheck protection program loans 2,023 0.1 % 4,564 0.2 %\nConsumer loans 611,583 19.0 % 405,278 13.8 %\nTotal Non-PCD loans 3,213,765 99.8 % 2,940,009 99.8 %\nPCD loans 5,649 0.2 % 6,628 0.2 %\nTotal loans $ 3,219,414 100.0 % $ 2,946,637 100.0 %\nThe following table sets forth the contractual maturity ranges of our loan portfolio and the amount of those loans with\nfixed and floating interest rates in each maturity range as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAfter 1 Y ear After 5 Y ears\nThrough 5 Years Through 15 Years After 15 Years\nOne Year Fixed Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Floating\nor Less Rate Rate Rate Rate Rate Rate Total\nLoans secured by real estate:\nCommercial real estate - owner\noccupied $ 26,048 $ 108,268 $ 26,771 $ 119,065 $ 112,586 $ 2,271 $ 60,388 $ 455,397\nCommercial real estate - non-\nowner occupied 35,094 206,689 39,687 51,404 66,762 11,127 167,837 578,600\nSecured by farmland 1,718 807 158 226 828 481 826 5,044\nConstruction and land\ndevelopment 116,510 19,907 16,140 48 6,486 673 4,978 164,742\nResidential 1-4 family 18,655 45,233 8,756 26,771 53,331 71,034 382,446 606,226\nMulti- family residential 7,738 68,788 6,489 — 18,277 — 26,565 127,857\nHome equity lines of credit 4,792 3,270 9,643 48 2,321 12 39,584 59,670\nTotal real estate loans 210,555 452,962 107,644 197,562 260,591 85,598 682,624 1,997,536\nCommercial loans 87,640 140,719 111,367 208,425 50,584 1,107 2,781 602,623\nPaycheck protection program loans 24 1,811 — 188 — — — 2,023\nConsumer loans 2,582 278,797 149,554 87,169 91,386 2,089 6 611,583\nTotal Non-PCD loans 300,801 874,289 368,565 493,344 402,561 88,794 685,411 3,213,765\nPCD loans 2,726 1,303 — — 1,227 393 - 5,649\nTotal loans $ 303,527 $ 875,592 $ 368,565 $ 493,344 $ 403,788 $ 89,187 $ 685,411 $ 3,219,414\n52\nThe following table sets forth the contractual maturity ranges of our Consumer Program loan portfolio as of\nDecember 31, 2023, which is only originated at fixed rates (in thousands):\nAfter One A fter Five\nOne Year or Year to Five Through After Ten\nLess Years Ten Years Years Total\nConsumer Program Loans $ 611 $ 135,263 $ 55,887 $ 7,511 $ 199,272\nThe following table describes the period over which our Consumer Program loans that are currently in a no interest\npromotional period will exit that promotional period and begin to amortize.

A substantial\nportion of the Bank’s nonperforming assets in the prior year comprised of two relationships with a combined balance of\napproximately $27.0 million. A large residential property with a balance of approximately $8.0 million included in that\ntotal was sold in the second quarter of 2023 and the other relationship, primarily consisting of assisted living facilities with\na book balance of $19.0 million, was sold at the end of a receiver-managed marketing process in the third quarter of 2023.\nWe identify potential problem loans based on loan portfolio credit quality. We define our potential problem loans as\ninternally rated as substandard loans less total nonperforming assets noted above. At December 31, 2023, our potential\nproblem loans totaled $6.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, our total substandard loans were $17.2 million, compared\nto $41.0 million at December 31, 2022, a 58% decline. Loans rated internally as special mention loans, which is one\ninternal credit rating higher than substandard, totaled $14.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and $32.3 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nWe will generally place a loan on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. Loans will also be placed on\nnonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan\n53\nagreement. Cash payments received while a loan is categorized as nonaccrual will be recorded as a reduction of principal\nas long as doubt exists as to future collections.\nWe maintain appraisals on loans secured by real estate, particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and\npotential problem loans. In instances where appraisals reflect reduced collateral values, we make an evaluation of the\nborrower’s overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for impairment or write-down to their fair values. If\nforeclosure occurs, we record OREO at the lower of our recorded investment in the loan or fair value less our estimated\ncosts to sell.\nOur loan portfolio losses and delinquencies have been primarily limited by our underwriting standards and portfolio\nmanagement practices. Whether losses and delinquencies in our portfolio will increase significantly depends upon the\nvalue of the real estate securing the loans and economic factors, such as the overall economy, rising or elevated interest\nrates, historically high or persistent inflation, and recessionary concerns.\nWe originate a portion of our consumer loans (the Consumer Program) using a third party that sources and subsequently\nmanages the portfolio of loans. As of December 31, 2023, the principal balance outstanding was $199.3 million. These\nloans are accounted for similar to our other consumer loans and are not placed on nonaccrual because they are charged off\nwhen they become 90 days past due. The allowance on this portfolio of loans was $22.4 million as of December 31, 2023\nand represented 43% of our total allowance for credit losses. Net charge-offs on this portfolio were $8.4 million in 2023\nand represented approximately 57% of net charge-offs recorded for the year. The Company tightened its origination criteria\nin regard to this portfolio in April of 2023 and from that point forward we generally originated loans to consumer borrowers\nbeing managed by the third party with FICO scores over 720, whereas prior period loan production included approximately\n40% of loans to borrowers with weaker credit scores. This older vintage lower credit score portion of the portfolio has\ndriven the uptick in related charge-offs in 2023 which continued into 2024 and necessitated the update of the Company’s\nexpected loss rates on this portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses as discussed in the Provision\nfor Credit Losses section of this MD&A. The newer production represented approximately 19% of the portfolio at\nDecember 31, 2023 and is expected to improve the quality mix of the portfolio and result in lower realized net charge-offs\nin future periods.\nLoan Review\nOur loan review program is administrated by the Chief Risk Officer and the Loan Review Manager who reports the\nresults directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. In 2023, the loan review program resulted in reviews on\nloan balances totaling $936.1 million or 47.5% of the commercial loan portfolio outstanding as of December 31, 2022.\nOverall, the loan review program resulted in loan reviews performed on 30.0% of the commercial portfolio by our internal\nloan review function and 17.5% by an independent third party consultant. The loan review program also reviewed $96.0\nmillion in unfunded commitments.\nPrimis Bank’s 2024 loan review program (the “Program”) was approved by the Audit Committee on January 25, 2024.\nThe Program’s annual goal is to have an overall review penetration rate of 45.0% - 50.0% of the commercial loan portfolio\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023. The Program incorporates a robust risk-based approach review of the Bank’s loan\nportfolio that will include the loan origination process and targeted portfolio and full-scope loan reviews. The Program’s\nreview goal remains well within regulatory standards and industry best practices. In accordance with Credit Policy, the\nBank’s Program will utilize and incorporate both internal and third-party external resources in a complementary fashion\nto achieve the objectives of the Program.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are very focused on the asset quality of our loan portfolio, both before and after a loan is made. We have established\nunderwriting standards that we believe are effective in maintaining high credit quality in our loan portfolio. We have\nexperienced loan officers who take personal responsibility for the loans they originate, a skilled underwriting team and\nhighly qualified credit officers that review each loan application carefully. We have designed a credit matrix, which\nrequires dual authority to approve any credit over $5.0 million. We have two specialty Executive Credit Officers with\nextensive industry experience in medical practice and life premium credit financing with authority up to $7.5 million and\n54\njoint authority with the Chief Credit Officer up to $10.0 million. All credit exposures over $10.0 million are reviewed and\napproved by Executive Loan Committee consisting of all named Credit Officers with concurrence from the Chief\nExecutive Officer on any credit in excess of $25.0 million. Loans in excess of 60% of the Bank’s legal lending limit are\napproved by the full Board of Directors or two outside directors.\nOur allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses.\nManagement evaluates the allowance at least quarterly. In addition, on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews our\nloan portfolio, evaluates credit quality, reviews the loan loss provision and the allowance for credit losses and requests\nmanagement to make changes as may be required. In evaluating the allowance, management and the board of directors\nconsider the growth, composition and industry diversification of the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current\ndelinquency levels and all other known factors affecting loan collectability.\nThe allowance for credit losses is based on the CECL methodology and represents management’s estimate of an amount\nappropriate to provide for expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. This estimate is based on historical credit loss\ninformation adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts applied to various loan types that\ncompose our portfolio, including the effects of known factors such as the economic environment within our market area\nwill have on net losses. The allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determination by the regulatory\nagencies as to the appropriate level of the allowance.\nTotal calculated reserves increased by $17.7 million to $52.2 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to\nmodeled reserves on the Consumer Program portfolio described above. Allowance for credit losses on the Consumer\nProgram loans was $22.4 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Excluding the allowances each\nperiod on this portfolio, the allowance for credit losses would have declined $3.3 million, due to lower allowances on\nindividually evaluated loans, lower default expectations observed in the models which resulted from our annual review\nand refinements to model, and improved economic forecasts, specifically in the House Price Index and Gross State Product\nfactors, partially offset by the overall loan growth experienced in 2023.\n55\nThe following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses allocated by loan category and the percent of loans in\neach category to total loans at the dates indicated (in thousands):\nAs of D ece m ber 31,\n2023 2022\nPercent of Percent of\nAllowance Loans by Allowance Loans by\nfor Credit Category to for Loan Category to\nLosses Total Loans Losses Total Loans\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied $ 4,255 14.1 % $ 5,558 15.6 %\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied 5,822 18.0 % 7,147 19.7 %\nSecured by farmland 31 0.2 % 25 0.2 %\nConstruction and land development 1,129 5.1 % 1,373 5.0 %\nResidential 1-4 family 4,938 18.8 % 4,091 20.7 %\nMulti- family residential 1,590 4.0 % 2,201 4.8 %\nHome equity lines of credit 364 1.9 % 329 2.2 %\nCommercial loans 6,320 18.7 % 7,853 17.7 %\nPaycheck Protection Program loans — 0.1 % — 0.2 %\nConsumer loans 26,088 19.0 % 3,895 13.7 %\nPCD loans 1,672 0.2 % 2,072 0.2 %\nTotal 52,209 100.0 % 34,544 100.0 %\nThe following table presents an analysis of the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFo r the Years End ed December 31,\n2023 2022\nBalance, beginning of period $ 34,544 $ 29,105\nProvision charged to operations:\nTotal provisions 32,540 11,271\nRecoveries credited to allowance:\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied 110 502\nConstruction and land development 112 —\nResidential 1-4 family 164 59\nHome equity lines of credit 5 3\nCommercial loans 948 1,638\nConsumer loans 480 35\nTotal recoveries 1,819 2,237\nLoans charged off:\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied — 14\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied 1,170 5,027\nConstruction and land development 2 —\nResidential 1-4 family 770 —\nHome equity lines of credit 32 14\nCommercial loans 2,854 1,040\nConsumer loans 11,866 1,974\nTotal loans charged-off 16,694 8,069\nNet charge-offs 14,875 5,832\nBalance, end of period $ 52,209 $ 34,544\nNet charge-offs to average loans, net of unearned income 0.45 % 0.22 %\nWe believe that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 is sufficient to absorb future expected credit\nlosses in our loan portfolio based on our assessment of all known factors affecting the collectability of our loan portfolio.\nOur assessment involves uncertainty and judgment; therefore, the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses cannot be\ndetermined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory authorities, as part\n56\nof their periodic examination, may require additional charges to the provision for credit losses in future periods if the\nresults of their reviews warrant additions to the allowance for credit losses.\nNet charge-offs were $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, up from $5.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Included in net charge-offs is $8.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, related to the Consumer Program loan portfolio. Excluding these Consumer Program charge-offs\nwe had an increase from the prior year of $2.2 million primarily related to disposition of certain nonperforming loans from\nDecember 31, 2022 that could not be collected.\nAs discussed previously, the increase in charge-offs on the Consumer Program loan portfolio have been driven by\nlosses concentrated in loans originated between the third quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Charge-offs from\nthese vintages in 2023 were 79% of the total gross charge-offs in this portfolio of consumer loans. The charge-off\npercentage as compared with total loans originated in the third quarter of 2022, fourth quarter of 2022, and first quarter of\n2023 was 6.9%, 4.3%, and 3.0%, respectively. We continued to see similar levels of losses on these vintages from year\nend through the time we filed this Form 10-K and as a result we updated our loss rates on the third-party portfolio as of\nand for the year ended December 31, 2023 which added an additional $18.2 million in provision and reserve during this\nperiod. The TPOS provides limited credit enhancement through certain direct payments and the release of funds from a\nreserve account. These amounts are recognized in our results of operations in the period in which they become available\nto us. During 2023, we recognized $4.4 million in our results of operations related to this credit enhancement. See\nadditional discussion of the credit enhancement in Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies in this MD&A.\nInvestment Securities\nOur investment securities portfolio provides us with required liquidity and collateral to pledge to secure public deposits,\ncertain other deposits, advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, and repurchase agreements.\nOur investment securities portfolio is managed by our Treasurer, who has significant experience in this area, with the\nconcurrence of our Asset/Liability Committee. In addition to our Treasurer (who is the chairman of the Asset/Liability\nCommittee) and our Controller, this committee is comprised of outside directors and other senior officers of the Bank,\nincluding but not limited to our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Investment management is\nperformed in accordance with our investment policy, which is approved annually by the Board of Directors. Our\ninvestment policy authorizes us to invest in:\n• Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) and\nthe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) residential mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) and\ncommercial mortgage backed securities (“CMBS”)\n• Collateralized mortgage obligations\n• U.S. Treasury securities\n• SBA guaranteed loan pools\n• Agency securities\n• Obligations of states and political subdivisions\n• Corporate debt securities, with rated securities at investment grade\n• Collateralized Loan Obligations (“CLOs”)\nMBS are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally\nissued by agency/government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”) such as the GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC. These securities are\ndeemed to have high credit ratings, and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by\nthe issuing agencies.\nCollateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) are bonds that are backed by pools of mortgages. The pools can be\nGNMA, FNMA or FHLMC pools or they can be private-label pools. The CMOs are designed so that the mortgage\ncollateral will generate a cash flow sufficient to provide for the timely repayment of the bonds. The mortgage collateral\n57\npool can be structured to accommodate various desired bond repayment schedules, provided that the collateral cash flow\nis adequate to meet scheduled bond payments. This is accomplished by dividing the bonds into classes to which payments\non the underlying mortgage pools are allocated. The bond’s cash flow, for example, can be dedicated to one class of\nbondholders at a time, thereby increasing call protection to bondholders. In private-label CMOs, losses on underlying\nmortgages are directed to the most junior of all classes and then to the classes above in order of increasing seniority, which\nmeans that the senior classes have enough credit protection to be given the highest credit rating by the rating agencies.\nObligations of states and political subdivisions (municipal securities) are purchased with consideration of the current\ntax position of the Bank. Both taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds may be purchased, but only after careful assessment\nof the market risk of the security. Appropriate credit evaluation must be performed prior to purchasing municipal bonds.\nCorporate bonds consist of senior and/or subordinated notes issued by banks. Bank subordinated debt, if rated, must\nbe of investment grade and non-rated bonds are permissible if the credit-worthiness of the issuer has been properly\nanalyzed.\nCLOs are actively managed securitization vehicles formed for the purpose of acquiring and managing a diversified\nportfolio of senior secured corporate bank loans, otherwise known as “broadly syndicated loans”. The loan portfolio is\ntransferred to bankruptcy-remote special-purpose vehicle, which finances the acquisition through the issuance of various\nclasses of debt and equity securities with varying levels of senior claim on the underlying loan portfolio. CLOs must be\nrated AA or better at the time of purchase.\nWe classify our investment securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Debt investment securities that\nPrimis has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized\ncost. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes\nin interest rates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value,\nwith unrealized gains or losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in\nstockholders’ equity. Our portfolio of available-for-sale securities currently contains a material amount of unrealized mark-\nto-market adjustments due to increases in market interest rates since the original purchase of many of these securities. We\nintend to hold these securities until maturity or recovery of the value and do not anticipate realizing any losses on the\ninvestments.\nInvestment securities, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled $240.1 million as of December 31, 2023, a\ndecrease of 3.9% from $249.8 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily due to paydowns, maturities, and calls of the\ninvestments during the year.\nWe recognized an immaterial amount of credit impairment charges related to credit losses on our held-to-maturity\ninvestment securities during 2023 and no credit losses during 2022.\n58\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the investment securities portfolio as of the dates indicated.

Weighted average yield is calculated as the tax-equivalent yield on a pro\nrata basis for each security based on its relative amortized cost. Yields on tax-exempt securities have been computed on a\ntax-equivalent basis. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to\ncall or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties (in thousands).\nInvestmen t Se cu rities Availab le- for-Sale\nWeighted\nAmortized Average\nCost Fair Value Yield\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\nDue after one year through five years $ 3,132 $ 3,056 2.99 %\nDue after five years through ten years 17,859 15,502 2.18 %\nDue after ten years 12,810 11,522 2.13 %\n33,801 30,080 2.23 %\nCollateralized loan obligations\nDue after ten years 5,018 4,982 6.77 %\nCorporate securities\nDue after five years through ten years 14,000 12,672 4.50 %\nDue after ten years 2,000 1,376 4.50 %\n16,000 14,048 4.50 %\nGovernment-sponsored agency securities\nDue less than one year — — — %\nDue after one year through five years 6,898 6,305 1.31 %\nDue after five years through ten years 4,879 3,924 1.80 %\nDue after ten years 4,490 3,482 2.09 %\n16,267 13,711 1.67 %\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities\nDue after one year through five years 2,009 1,947 2.40 %\nDue after five years through ten years 20,618 18,287 1.97 %\nDue after ten years 85,678 74,363 1.90 %\n110,562 96,808 1.96 %\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations\nDue after one year through five years 1,368 1,305 0.03 %\nDue after five years through ten years 5,580 5,508 4.49 %\nDue after ten years 28,979 27,658 3.77 %\n35,927 34,471 3.85 %\nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities\nDue less than one year 4,973 4,860 2.40 %\nDue after one year through five years 2,003 1,928 2.58 %\nDue after five years through ten years 20,402 17,501 1.49 %\nDue after ten years 6,681 5,821 1.46 %\n34,059 30,110 1.68 %\nSBA pool securities\nDue after one year through five years 655 638 4.79 %\nDue after five years through ten years 709 707 7.75 %\nDue after ten years 2,893 2,865 7.37 %\n4,257 4,210 7.04 %\n$ 255,891 $ 228,420 2.28 %\nInvestment Securities Held-to-Maturity\nWeighted\nAmortized Average\nCost Fair Value Yield\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\nDue after one year through five years $ 580 $ 580 2.98 %\nDue after five years through ten years 939 899 2.40 %\n2,391 2,349 2.74 %\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities\nDue after one year through five years 417 402 2.18 %\nDue after five years through ten years 950 896 2.80 %\nDue after ten years 7,673 6,988 2.46 %\n9,040 8,286 2.48 %\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations\nDue after ten years 219 204 2.56 %\n$ 11,650 $ 10,839 2.54 %\nFor additional information regarding investment securities refer to “Item 8.

We offer a line of traditional deposit products that currently include noninterest-\nbearing and interest-bearing checking (or NOW accounts), commercial checking, money market accounts, savings\naccounts and certificates of deposit. We compete for deposits through our banking branches with competitive pricing, as\nwell as nationally through advertising and online banking. We use deposits as a principal source of funding for our lending,\npurchasing of investment securities and for other business purposes.\nTotal deposits increased 20.1% to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2023 from $2.72 billion as of December 31, 2022.\nThe increase in deposits from 2022 year-end was primarily driven by the substantial growth in the Bank’s digital deposit\nplatform in 2023. The majority of the overall deposit growth was in savings accounts with the remainder primarily in\nNOW accounts (both largely coming from the digital platform). Savings accounts increased 219% from $245.8 million as\nof December 31, 2022 to $783.8 million as of December 31, 2023. NOW accounts increased 25.2% from $617.7 million\nas of December 31, 2022 to $773.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Our deposits are diversified in type and by underlying\ncustomer and lack significant concentrations to any type of customer (i.e. commercial, consumer, government) or industry.\nUninsured deposits are defined as the portion of deposit accounts in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit\nand amounts in any other uninsured investment or deposit account that are classified as deposits and are not subject to any\nfederal or state deposit insurance regimes. Total uninsured deposits as calculated per regulatory guidance were $1.15\nbillion, or 34.8% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth the average balance and average rate paid on each of the deposit categories for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nAverage Average Average Average\nBalance Rate Balance Rate\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 495,107 $ 614,285\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nSavings accounts 777,143 3.83 % 224,755 0.33 %\nMoney market accounts 831,196 2.85 % 807,330 0.79 %\nNOW and other demand accounts 784,680 1.96 % 698,907 0.33 %\nTime deposits 474,178 3.12 % 350,720 1.11 %\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,867,197 2.92 % 2,081,712 0.64 %\nTotal deposits $ 3,362,304 $ 2,695,997\nThe variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to be competitive in obtaining funds and in responding to the threat\nof disintermediation (the flow of funds away from depository institutions such as banking institutions into direct\ninvestment vehicles such as government and corporate securities). Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, and the\neffect of such retention on our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by the general\neconomy and market rates of interest.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of certificates of deposit of $100 thousand and over as of December 31,\n2023 (in thousands):\nWithin 3 to 6 6 to 12 Over 12\n3 Months Months Months Months Total\n$ 86,150 $ 65,848 $ 81,485 $ 24,122 $ 257,605\n61\nOther Borrowings\nWe use other borrowed funds to support our liquidity needs and to temporarily satisfy our funding needs from increased\nloan demand and for other shorter term purposes. We are a member of the FHLB and are authorized to obtain advances\nfrom the FHLB from time to time as needed. The FHLB has a credit program for members with different maturities and\ninterest rates, which may be fixed or variable. We are required to collateralize our borrowings from the FHLB with\npurchases of FHLB stock and other collateral acceptable to the FHLB. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, total FHLB\nborrowings were $30.0 million and $325.0 million, respectively. The decrease in FHLB borrowings was a result of the\ndeposit growth during 2023 that primarily funded our loan growth and supported other funding needs. At December 31,\n2023, we had $466.1 million of unused and available FHLB lines of credit.\nOther borrowings can consist of FHLB convertible advances, FHLB overnight advances, other FHLB advances\nmaturing within one year, federal funds purchased, secured borrowings due to failed loan sales, and securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase (“repo”) that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with customers. The balance\nin repo accounts at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3.0 million and $6.4 million, respectively.\nOther borrowings consist of the following (in thousands):\nDec emb er 31,\n2023 2022\nFHLB convertible advances maturing 3/1/2030 $ 30,000 $ —\nShort-term FHLB advances maturing 1/03/2023 — 50,000\nShort-term FHLB advances maturing 1/13/2023 — 100,000\nShort-term FHLB advances maturing 1/23/2023 — 50,000\nShort-term FHLB advances maturing 1/27/2023 — 125,000\nTotal FHLB advances 30,000 325,000\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase 3,044 6,445\nTotal $ 33,044 $ 331,445\nWeighted average interest rate at year end 5.57 % 4.19 %\nFor the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAverage outstanding balance $ 49,792 $ 97,795\nAverage interest rate during the year 4.32 % 2.72 %\nMaximum month-end outstanding balance $ 33,044 $ 331,445\nWe had secured borrowings as of December 31, 2023 of $20.4 million related to loan transfers to another financial\ninstitution during 2023 that did not meet the criteria to be treated as a sale under relevant accounting guidance. These\nborrowings reflect the cash received for transferring the loans to the other financial institution and any unamortized sale\npremium and are secured by approximately the same amount of loans held for investment that are recorded in our balance\nsheet. We retained the servicing of the loans that were transferred and accordingly receive principal and interest from the\nborrower as contractually required and transfer the interest to the other financial institution net of our contractually agreed\nupon servicing fee. The loans transferred have an average maturity of approximately ten years which will be the time over\nwhich the principal balance of the loans in our balance sheet and secured borrowings will pay down, absent borrower\nprepayments. There were no secured borrowings due to loan transfers as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFor additional information on secured borrowings refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 –\nOrganization and Significant Accounting Policies.”\n62\nJunior Subordinated Debt and Senior Subordinated Notes\nFor information about junior subordinated debt and senior subordinated notes and their anticipated principal\nrepayments refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12 – Junior Subordinated Debt and\nSenior Subordinated Notes.”\nInterest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk\nWe are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings into interest-\nearning loans and investments. Consequently, our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income, which\nis the difference between the interest income on loans and other investments and the interest expense on deposits and\nborrowings. To the extent that our interest-bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest-\nearning assets, we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income. Our Asset-Liability\nCommittee (“ALCO”) meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position and\nestablishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk. The policies established by the ALCO are reviewed\nand approved by our Board of Directors. We have employed asset/liability management policies that seek to manage our\nnet interest income, without having to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk.\nWe use simulation modeling to manage our interest rate risk and review quarterly interest sensitivity. This approach\nuses a model which generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity (“EVE”) over a range of interest\nrate scenarios. EVE is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts using\nassumptions including estimated loan prepayment rates, reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates.\nThe following tables are based on an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by the estimated change in EVE\nresulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve (plus 400 basis points or minus 400 basis\npoints, measured in 100 basis point increments) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. All changes are within our\nAsset/Liability Risk Management Policy guidelines (amounts in thousands).\nSe ns itivity of E VE\nAs of December 31, 2023\nEVE EVE as a % of\nChange in Interest Rates $ Change % Change Total Equity\nin Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base From Base Assets Book Value\nUp 400 $ 428,175 $ (54,019) (11.20)% 11.10 % 107.69 %\nUp 300 438,298 (43,896) (9.10)% 11.37 % 110.24 %\nUp 200 447,711 (34,483) (7.15)% 11.61 % 112.61 %\nUp 100 471,457 (10,737) (2.23)% 12.22 % 118.58 %\nBase 482,194 — — % 12.50 % 121.28 %\nDown 100 486,399 4,205 0.87 % 12.61 % 122.34 %\nDown 200 477,430 (4,764) (0.99)% 12.38 % 120.08 %\nDown 300 456,987 (25,207) (5.23)% 11.85 % 114.94 %\nDown 400 417,079 (65,115) (13.50)% 10.81 % 104.90 %\n63\nSen si tivity of EV E\nAs of December 31, 2022\nEVE EVE as a % of\nChange in Interest Rates $ Change % Change Total Equity\nin Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base From Base Assets Book Value\nUp 400 $ 481,135 $ (63,410) (11.64)% 13.49 % 123.70 %\nUp 300 496,136 (48,409) (8.89)% 13.91 % 127.55 %\nUp 200 510,807 (33,738) (6.20)% 14.32 % 131.32 %\nUp 100 534,163 (10,382) (1.91)% 14.98 % 137.33 %\nBase 544,545 — — % 15.27 % 140.00 %\nDown 100 539,297 (5,248) (0.96)% 15.12 % 138.65 %\nDown 200 513,948 (30,597) (5.62)% 14.41 % 132.13 %\nDown 300 475,536 (69,009) (12.67)% 13.33 % 122.26 %\nDown 400 406,524 (138,021) (25.35)% 11.40 % 104.51 %\nOur interest rate sensitivity is also monitored by management through the use of a model that generates estimates of\nthe change in net interest income (“NII”) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NII depends upon the relative amounts of\ninterest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them. In this regard, the model\nassumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at December 31, 2023 and 2022 remains\nconstant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly\nacross the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. All changes are\nwithin our ALM Policy guidelines at December 31, 2023 and 2022 (amounts in thousands).\nSensiti vity of NII\nAs of December 31, 2023\nAdjusted NII\nChange in Interest Rates $ Change\nin Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base\nUp 400 $ 98,539 $ (16,112)\nUp 300 101,939 (12,712)\nUp 200 105,326 (9,325)\nUp 100 110,513 (4,138)\nBase 114,651 —\nDown 100 117,230 2,579\nDown 200 118,099 3,448\nDown 300 118,114 3,463\nDown 400 119,065 4,414\nSensiti vity of NII\nAs of December 31, 2022\nAdjusted NII\nChange in Interest Rates $ Change\nin Basis Points (Rate Shock) Amount From Base\nUp 400 $ 108,514 $ (12,447)\nUp 300 111,127 (9,834)\nUp 200 113,730 (7,231)\nUp 100 117,811 (3,150)\nBase 120,961 —\nDown 100 122,070 1,109\nDown 200 120,687 (274)\nDown 300 117,272 (3,689)\nDown 400 113,648 (7,313)\nSensitivity of EVE and NII are modeled using different assumptions and approaches. Certain shortcomings are inherent\nin the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in EVE and NII sensitivity\nrequires the making of certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond\nto changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, although the EVE tables and NII tables provide an indication of our\ninterest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to, and do not, provide a precise\nforecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net worth and NII.\n64\nLiquidity and Funds Management\nThe objective of our liquidity management is to ensure the ability to meet our financial obligations. These obligations\ninclude the payment of deposits on demand or at maturity, the repayment of borrowings at maturity and the ability to fund\ncommitments and other new business opportunities. We obtain funding from a variety of sources, including customer\ndeposit accounts, customer certificates of deposit and payments on our loans and investments. If our level of core deposits\nare not sufficient to fully fund our lending activities, we have access to funding from additional sources, including but not\nlimited to borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and institutional certificates of deposits. In addition,\nwe maintain federal funds lines of credit with two correspondent banks, totaling $75 million, and utilize securities sold\nunder agreements to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement borrowings from approved securities dealers as needed.\nFor additional information about borrowings and anticipated principal repayments refer to the discussion about Contractual\nObligations below and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11 – Securities Sold Under\nAgreements To Repurchase And Other Short-Term Borrowings, Note 12 – Junior Subordinated Debt and Senior\nSubordinated Notes, and Note 16 – Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk.”\nWe prepare a cash flow forecast on a 30, 60 and 90 day basis along with a one and two year basis. These projections\nincorporate expected cash flows on loans, investment securities, and deposits based on data used to prepare our interest\nrate risk analyses. As of December 31, 2023, Primis was not aware of any known trends, events or uncertainties that have\nor are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our liquidity. As of December 31, 2023, Primis has no material\ncommitments or long-term debt for capital expenditures.\nCapital Resources\nCapital management consists of providing equity to support both current and future operations. Primis Financial Corp.\nand its subsidiary, Primis Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking\nagencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional\ndiscretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements.\nUnder capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (“PCA”), we must meet\nspecific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items\nas calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nmost recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under regulatory framework for PCA. Federal\nbanking agencies do not provide a similar well capitalized threshold for bank holding companies.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Primis to maintain minimum\namounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management\nbelieves, as of December 31, 2023, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nSee “Item 1. Business, Supervision and Regulation—Capital Requirements” for more information.\n65\nThe following table provides a comparison of the leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios of Primis Financial Corp.\nand Primis Bank at the periods indicated to the minimum and well-capitalized required regulatory standards. These ratios\nwere not impacted by the goodwill impairment charge incurred during 2023 because goodwill is not a component of the\ncalculations:\nMinimum\nRequired for\nCapital To Be Actual Ratio at\nAdequacy Categorized as December 31, December 31,\nPurposes Well Capitalized (1) 2023 2022\nPrimis Financial Corp.\nLeverage ratio 4.00 % n/a 8.37 % 9.52 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 4.50 % n/a 8.96 % 10.07 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 6.00 % n/a 9.25 % 10.40 %\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 8.00 % n/a 13.44 % 14.33 %\nPrimis Bank\nLeverage ratio 4.00 % 5.00 % 9.80 % 11.24 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 7.00 % 6.50 % 10.88 % 12.40 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 8.50 % 8.00 % 10.88 % 12.40 %\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 10.50 % 10.00 % 12.12 % 13.59 %\n(1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level.\nBank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines (“Basel III”) aimed at strengthening existing\ncapital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and Primis\nBank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a\n2.5% “capital conservation buffer”, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the\ncapital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital\nconservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result\nin certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nPrimis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had\na capital conservation buffer of 4.12% at December 31, 2023, which exceeded the 2.50% minimum requirement below\nwhich the regulators may impose limits on distributions.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related financial data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K concerning Primis\nFinancial Corp. have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require the measurement of financial position\nand operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money\nover time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs.\nUnlike most industrial companies, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in\nnature. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than do the effects of\nchanges in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction\nor in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Many factors impact interest rates, including the decisions\nof the FRB, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, and international disorder and instability\nin domestic and foreign financial markets. Like most financial institutions, changes in interest rates can impact our net\ninterest income which is the difference between interest earned from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment\nsecurities, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, as well as the valuation of our\nassets and liabilities.\nOur interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee (the\n“Asset/Liability Committee”). The Asset/Liability Committee has established policies and limits for management to\nmonitor, measure and coordinate our sources, uses and pricing of funds. The Asset/Liability Committee makes reports to\nthe board of directors on a quarterly basis.\n66\nSeasonality and Cycles\nWe do not consider our commercial banking business to be seasonal.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPrimis is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of\ncredit and guarantees of credit card accounts. These instruments involve elements of credit and funding risk in excess of\nthe amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by\nPrimis to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is\nessentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. We had letters of credit outstanding totaling $9.6\nmillion and $10.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for\ncommitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the\nsame credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless\nnoted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition\nestablished in the contract. Commitments are made predominately for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed\nexpiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually require payment of a fee. Since many of\nthe commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily\nrepresent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.\nFor additional information about off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to the discussion “Item 8. Financial Statements\nand Supplementary Data, Note 16 – Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk.”\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance\nwith ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk\nresulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to\ncancel the obligation. Off-balance-sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines\nof credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers\nboth the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the\ncommitment or other off-balance-sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical\nutilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses on\ncommitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts\nexpected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in “Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data, Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses”, as if such commitments were funded.\nItem 7A.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of\nits operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 15, 2024, expressed an\nadverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts, and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication\nof critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as\n68\na whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses (ACL) on loans held for investment was $52.2 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The determination of the ACL has been identified by the Company as a critical accounting\npolicy. The ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar loan risk characteristics exist, and by individually\nevaluating loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. As further described in Notes 1 and 4 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the Company measures the ACL using a combination of probability of default\n(PD), probability of attrition (PA), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD), calculated based on\nthe application of historical loss experience, and adjusted for a reasonable and supportable forecast. Estimates\nare qualitatively adjusted for risk factors that are not considered within the quantitative modeling process.\nEstimating an appropriate ACL requires management to make numerous assumptions about losses that will\noccur over the remaining contractual life of loans recorded as of the balance sheet date. The most significant\njudgments in the ACL as of December 31, 2023 included the determination of a reasonable and supportable\nforecast.\nWe identified the Company’s estimate of the ACL as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that\ndetermination were the degree of subjectivity and judgment required to audit management’s identification of\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent\nof effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s significant\nestimates and assumptions. Also, as described in the “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm” related to internal controls over financial reporting, a material weakness was identified in relation to the\nprecision of management’s review of the adequacy of reserves for certain loan segments.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n• We obtained an understanding of the Company’s process for establishing the ACL, including the\ndetermination of a reasonable and supportable forecast.\n• We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to\nmanagement’s determination of the ACL, including controls over:\no The completeness, accuracy, and relevancy of inputs into the model used to determine\nthe AC; and,\no The determination of a reasonable and supportable forecast.\n• We evaluated management’s determination of a reasonable and supportable forecast, including\ntesting the application of the forecast in quantitative ACL calculation. We also utilized our internal\nvaluation specialists to assist us in testing the application of the forecast to the ACL calculation.\n• We tested the mathematical accuracy of the ACL.\n69\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nThe Company has $93.5 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2023. The Company also recorded a goodwill\nimpairment charge of $11.2 million during 2023 related to the Primis Bank reporting unit. The determination of\nthe annual goodwill impairment assessment has been identified by the Company as a critical accounting\nestimate. As further described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for\nimpairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, occurring as of September 30th every year, or more\nfrequently if events or circumstances warrant. The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist in\nperforming its quantitative impairment analysis, which included a combination of valuation approaches to\ndetermine the fair value of each of the reporting units. These valuation approaches required certain\nassumptions such as the discount rate, economic conditions, which impact assumptions related to interest and\ngrowth rates, the control premium associated with the reporting unit, and a relative weight given to the\nvaluations derived by the valuation methods.\nWe identified the Company’s quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, as of September 30, 2023, as a\ncritical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination were the degree of subjectivity and\njudgment required to audit management’s goodwill impairment assessment. Specifically, evaluating the\nvaluation approaches selected and key assumptions used by management in performing its assessment, such\nas the determination of the discount rate and cash flows utilized in the valuation approaches.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n• We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related to\nmanagement’s goodwill impairment assessment including controls over management’s review\nof the quantitative analyses performed on each of the reporting units, including the key\nassumptions used to determine the fair value of each of the reporting units.\n• We tested key financial data used within the valuation approaches by agreeing key inputs to\ninternal and external sources.\n• We evaluated, with the assistance of our internal valuation specialists, appropriateness of\nvaluation approaches selected by management, the selection of a control premium and of\ncomparable publicly traded companies, and the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair\nvalue of each of the reporting units.\nConsumer Program Derivative\nThe Company has an agreement with a third-party to originate and service consumer loans that are included\nin the Company’s held for investment portfolio. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,\nas part of the agreement, there are certain payments required between the Company and the third-party if\ncertain events occur. The Company determined that this agreement meets the definition of a derivative financial\ninstrument. The Company has recorded a $10.8 million derivative asset as of December 31, 2023 related to\nthe master services agreement. The determination and valuation of the derivative asset has been identified by\nthe Company as a critical accounting estimate. The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist in\ncalculating the derivative value, using a discounted cash flow model.\nWe identified the Company’s derivative asset as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that\ndetermination were the degree of subjectivity and judgment required to audit management’s determination that\nthe agreement meets the definition of a derivative as well as the fair value of the derivative at the balance sheet\ndate. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort when performing audit\nprocedures, specifically around management’s determination of the discount rate, including the evaluation of\nthe counterparty credit risk. Additionally, a material weakness was identified by the Company related to the\naccounting of the Consumer Program, including the identification of the derivative asset.\n70\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:\n• We obtained management’s analysis of the agreements and compared the analysis to relevant\naccounting literature, the executed agreements with the third party and to our understanding of\nthe transactions gained through other audit procedures.\n• We obtained an understanding of the Company’s process to identify and value the derivative\nrelated to the agreement with the third-party to the Consumer Program.\n• We tested key financial data used within the discounted cash flow model by agreeing key inputs\nto internal and external sources.\n• We evaluated, with the assistance of our internal valuation specialists, appropriateness of the\nvaluation approach selected by management, the determination of the discount rate utilized in\nthe income valuation approach, the evaluation of counterparty credit risk, and the overall\nreasonableness of the estimated fair value of the derivative.\n/s/ Forvis Mazars, LLP\nWe served as the Company’s auditor from 2013 to 2024.\nTysons, Virginia\nOctober 15, 2024\n71\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders, Board of Directors, and Audit Committee\nPrimis Financial Corp.\nOpinion on the Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Primis Financial Corp.’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,\nsuch that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim\nfinancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses\nhave been identified and included in management’s assessment.\nThe Company did not maintain effective controls over the design and operation of its accounting\ndeterminations for transfers of financial assets, including lack of a formally designed process and\nprocedure for evaluation of loan transfers. The existing procedures did not outline the process to be\ntaken and individuals to be involved in the assessment of the proper accounting for loan transfers and\nwere not sufficient to facilitate a proper conclusion on loan transfer transactions.\nThe Company did not maintain effective controls over the design and operation for establishing the\nallowance for credit losses for a pool of third-party managed consumer loans that are originated and\nserviced by a third party, including evaluating recent loss history on the portfolio relative to previous\nmodel inputs. The existing process relies on publicly available peer data for historical credit loss\ncharacteristics to inform the Company’s allowance calculation because the portfolio is relatively new\nand did not have an extended credit loss history to serve as the primary source of credit loss history\nwhen constructing the model.\nThe Company did not maintain effective controls over their accounting evaluation for a complex\nagreement with a third-party that sources and manages a portfolio of consumer loans for the Company.\nThe existing process did not appropriately facilitate a thorough evaluation of the entire transaction and\ndid not include the involvement of individuals with the necessary expertise to enable identification of\ncomplex accounting matters in the agreement and to conclude on them.\nThese material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of auditing\nprocedures applied in our audit of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and this report does not\naffect our report dated October 15, 2024 on those consolidated financial statements.\nIn our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the\nobjectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework:\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, and for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and our report dated\nOctober 15, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n72\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to\nthe Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinitions and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of reliable financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,\nin reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of\nthe company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Forvis Mazars, LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nOctober 15, 2024\n73\nPRIMIS FINANCIAL CORP.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\nD ecember 31, D ecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents:\nCash and due from financial institutions $ 1,863 $ 6,868\nInterest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions 75,690 70,991\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 77,553 77,859\nSecurities available-for-sale, at fair value (amortized cost of $255,891 and $269,036, respectively) 228,420 236,315\nSecurities held-to-maturity, at amortized cost (fair value of $10,839 and $12,449, respectively) 11,650 13,520\nLoans held for sale, at fair value 57,691 27,626\nLoans held for investment, collateralizing secured borrowings 20,505 —\nLoans held for investment 3,198,909 2,946,637\nLess: allowance for credit losses (52,209) (34,544)\nNet loans 3,167,205 2,912,093\nStock in Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) 14,246 25,815\nBank premises and equipment, net 20,611 25,257\nAssets held for sale 6,735 3,115\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 10,646 5,335\nCloud computing arrangement assets, net 10,699 10,464\nGoodwill 93,459 104,609\nIntangible assets, net 1,958 3,254\nBank-owned life insurance 67,588 67,201\nDeferred tax assets, net 22,395 19,874\nConsumer Program derivative asset 10,806 —\nOther assets 54,884 34,327\nTotal assets $ 3,856,546 $ 3,566,664\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 472,941 $ 582,572\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nNOW accounts 773,028 617,687\nMoney market accounts 794,530 811,365\nSavings accounts 783,758 245,786\nTime deposits 445,898 465,057\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 2,797,214 2,139,895\nTotal deposits 3,270,155 2,722,467\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase 3,044 6,445\nSecured borrowings 20,393 —\nFHLB advances 30,000 325,000\nJunior subordinated debt 9,830 9,781\nSenior subordinated notes 85,765 85,531\nOperating lease liabilities 11,686 5,767\nConsumer Program derivative liability — 473\nOther liabilities 28,080 22,232\nTotal liabilities 3,458,953 3,177,696\nCommitments and contingencies (See Note 15)\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value.

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrimis Financial Corp. (“Primis,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is the bank holding company for Primis Bank\n(“Primis Bank” or the “Bank”), a Virginia state-chartered bank which commenced operations on April 14, 2005. Primis\nBank provides a range of financial services to individuals and small and medium-sized businesses.\nAt December 31, 2023, Primis Bank had twenty-four full-service branches in Virginia and Maryland and also provided\nservices to customers through certain online and mobile applications. The Company is headquartered in McLean, Virginia\nand has an administrative office in Glen Allen, Virginia and an operations center in Atlee, Virginia. Primis Mortgage\nCompany (“PMC”), a residential mortgage lender headquartered in Wilmington, North Carolina, is a consolidated\nsubsidiary of Primis Bank. Panacea Financial Holdings, Inc. (“PFH”), headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas, is\nconsolidated into the Company. PFH owns the rights to the Panacea Financial brand and its intellectual property and\npartners with the Bank to offer a suite of financial products and services for doctors, their practices, and ultimately the\nbroader healthcare industry.\nThe accounting policies and practices of Primis and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“U.S. GAAP”) and to general practice within the banking industry. Material policies and practices are described\nin this footnote.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Primis and its subsidiaries Primis Bank, PMC and PFH.\nSignificant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Primis consolidates\nsubsidiaries in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent of the voting rights or where it exercises control.\nEntities where Primis holds 20 to 50 percent of the voting rights, or has the ability to exercise significant influence, or\nboth, are accounted for under the equity method. Primis owns EVB Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”) which is an\nunconsolidated subsidiary and the junior subordinated debt owed to the Trust is reported as a liability of Primis. Primis\nconsolidates PFH, as a result of the determination that it has a controlling financial interest over the entity as further\ndescribed below.\nWe determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a\nvoting interest entity or a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. Voting interest entities are entities in which\nthe total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and provides the equity\nholders with the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the\nentity’s activities. We consolidate voting interest entities in which we have all, or at least a majority of, the voting interest.\nAs defined in U.S. GAAP, VIEs are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A\ncontrolling financial interest in a VIE is present when an enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE\nthat most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive\nbenefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The enterprise with a controlling financial interest, known as the\nprimary beneficiary, consolidates the VIE. The Company has investments in VIE’s for which we are not the primary\nbeneficiary and, as such, are not included in our consolidated financial statements. The Company also has an investment\nin a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nOn April 28, 2022, Primis Bank entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding\ncapital stock of SeaTrust Mortgage Company (“SeaTrust”), a North Carolina corporation. On May 31, 2022, Primis Bank\ncompleted the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of 100% of the outstanding capital stock of SeaTrust from Community First\nBank, Inc. (the “Seller”) pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 28, 2022 (the “Purchase Agreement”)\nby and among the Bank, Seller, and SeaTrust. As a result, SeaTrust became a wholly owned subsidiary of Primis Bank on\nMay 31, 2022. Following the closing of the Acquisition, on June 1, 2022, the Bank changed the name of SeaTrust to Primis\nMortgage Company. At the time of acquisition, PMC originated mortgages primarily in North and South Carolina, Florida\nand Tennessee from eight offices but has since expanded its ability to originate mortgages to the majority of the U.S.\n78\nPursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Bank paid an aggregate purchase price of $7.0 million in cash to Seller at closing\nand assumed $19.3 million of SeaTrust’s indebtedness under certain warehouse lending facilities.\nOn December 21, 2023, PFH completed a $24.5 million Series B financing round led by a global venture capital firm.\nAs part of the financing round, Primis acquired approximately 19% of PFH’s common stock for an immaterial purchase\nprice due to previous operating losses in the Bank’s Panacea Financial Division. The Company performed an analysis and\ndetermined that PFH is a VIE because it lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The Company’s\nanalysis further determined that it has a controlling financial interest in PFH due to the substantial historical activities\nbetween PFH and the Bank’s Panacea Financial Division coupled with the limited activities of PFH outside of its\nrelationship with Primis as of December 31, 2023. There are employees of Primis that have historically carried out\nsubstantially all of the activities of PFH. Accordingly, the Company determined it is the primary beneficiary of PFH and\nconsolidated it as of December 31, 2023.\nDiscontinued Operation\nPrimis Bank had an interest in one mortgage company, Southern Trust Mortgage, LLC (“STM”). Prior to December 31,\n2021, Primis Bank owned 43.28% and 100% of STM’s common and preferred stock, respectively, and STM was\nconsidered an unconsolidated affiliate of the Company. On September 23, 2021, Primis Bank entered into an agreement\nwith STM, whereby STM agreed to purchase all of the Bank’s common membership interests and a portion of the Bank’s\npreferred interests in STM for a combination of $1.6 million in cash and the assumption of a promissory note in the amount\nof $8.5 million. The transaction closed on December 31, 2021. Upon closing, STM continued to be a borrower of the\nBank, but the Bank is no longer a minority owner of STM and STM is no longer considered an affiliate of the Company.\nThe Company still held 100% of STM’s preferred stock as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 but no longer had a position\non STM’s board of directors and STM no longer represented a reportable operating segment of the Company as of either\ndate.\nReclassifications\nIn certain instances, amounts reported in prior years’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to\nconform to the current financial statement presentation. The Company reclassified its other equity investment gains during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 that were presented in other noninterest income in the prior year financial statements\nwith its previously reported “gain on sale of other investment” and retitled the line “gain on other investments”.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements\nand the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to change in the near term include: the determination of the allowance\nfor credit losses, the fair value of investment securities, the credit impairment of investment securities, the mortgage\nbanking derivatives, interest rate swap derivatives, Consumer Program derivative, the valuation of goodwill and deferred\ntax assets.\nInvestment Securities\nSecurities Available-for-Sale and Held-to Maturity\nDebt securities that Primis has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and\ncarried at amortized cost.\n79\nSecurities classified as available-for-sale are those debt securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest\nrates, liquidity needs or other similar factors. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains\nor losses net of deferred taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.\nPremiums and discounts are generally amortized using the interest method with a constant effective yield without\nanticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Premiums on callable\nsecurities are amortized to their earliest call date. Gains and losses on the sale of investment securities are recorded on the\nsettlement date and are determined using the specific identification method.\nPrimis purchases amortizing investment securities. The actual principal reduction on these assets varies from the\nexpected contractual principal reduction due to principal prepayments resulting from the borrowers’ election to refinance\nthe underlying mortgage based on market and other conditions. The purchased premiums and discounts associated with\nthese assets are amortized or accreted to interest income over the estimated life of the related assets. The estimated life is\ncalculated by projecting future prepayments and the resulting principal cash flows until maturity. Prepayment rate\nprojections utilize actual prepayment speed experience and available market information on like-kind instruments. The\nprepayment rates form the basis for income recognition of premiums and discounts on the related assets. Changes in\nprepayment estimates may cause the earnings recognized on these assets to vary over the term that the assets are held,\ncreating volatility in the net interest margin. Prepayment rate assumptions are monitored and updated monthly to reflect\nactual activity and the most recent market projections.\nNon-marketable Equity Securities\nPrimis’ investment in STM’s preferred stock and other investments are considered to be non-marketable equity\nsecurities that do not have a readily determinable fair value. Equity securities with no recurring market value data available\nare reviewed periodically and any observable market value change is adjusted through net income. Primis evaluates these\nnon-marketable equity securities for impairment and recoverability of the recorded investment by considering positive and\nnegative evidence, including the profitability and asset quality, dividend payment history and recent redemption\nexperience. Impairment is assessed at each reporting period and if identified, is recognized in noninterest income.\nOther investments include stock acquired for regulatory purposes. The Bank is a member of the FHLB system.\nMembers are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest\nin additional amounts. The Bank is also required to own FRB stock with a par value equal to 6% of capital and FHLB\nstock of 4.25% of borrowings outstanding. FHLB and FRB stock is carried at cost and periodically evaluated for\nimpairment based on ultimate recovery of the par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.\nLoans Held for Sale\nThe PMC loans held for sale are originated and held until sold to permanent investors. The Company has elected to\ncarry these loans at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with the fair value option under Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 825, Financial Instruments. The fair value is\ndetermined by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities. Gains and losses on loan sales are recorded in\nmortgage banking income and direct loan origination costs are included in noninterest expense in the consolidated\nstatements of income and comprehensive income (loss).\nLoans\nPrimis provides commercial and consumer loans to customers. Primis also purchases mortgage loans from mortgage\nloans originators, including PMC. A substantial portion of the loan portfolio is represented by loans secured by real estate\nthroughout its market area. The ability of Primis’ debtors to honor their contracts is in varying degrees dependent upon\nthe real estate market conditions and general economic conditions in their debtor’s market area.\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are\nreported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances, including purchased premiums and discounts and any deferred\nloan fees or costs. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct\n80\norigination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the related loan yield using the interest method without\nanticipating prepayments.\nCommercial real estate loans consist of borrowings secured by owner occupied and non-owner occupied commercial\nreal estate. Repayment of these loans is dependent upon rental income or the subsequent sale of the property for loans\nsecured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate and by cash flows from business operations for owner occupied\ncommercial real estate. Loans for which the source of repayment is rental income are primarily impacted by local economic\nconditions which dictate occupancy rates and the amount of rent charged. Commercial real estate loans that are dependent\non cash flows from operations can also be adversely affected by current market conditions for their product or service.\nConstruction and land development loans primarily consist of borrowings to purchase and develop raw land into\nresidential and non-residential properties. Construction loans are extended to individuals as well as corporations for the\nconstruction of an individual or multiple properties and are secured by raw land and the subsequent improvements.\nRepayment of the loans to real estate developers is dependent upon the sale or lease of properties to third parties in a timely\nfashion upon completion. Should there be delays in construction or a downturn in the market for those properties, there\nmay be significant erosion in value which may be absorbed by Primis.\nCommercial loans consist of borrowings for commercial purposes to individuals, corporations, partnerships, sole\nproprietorships, and other business enterprises. Commercial loans are generally secured by business assets such as\nequipment, accounts receivable, inventory, or any other asset excluding real estate and generally made to finance capital\nexpenditures or operations. Primis’ risk exposure is related to deterioration in the value of collateral securing the loan\nshould foreclosure become necessary. Generally, business assets used or produced in operations do not maintain their\nvalue upon foreclosure which may require Primis to write-down the value significantly to sell. Commercial loans also\ninclude Life Premium Finance loans. These loans are utilized to pay the annual premiums due on the whole or universal\nlife policy. The Life Premium Finance loans are fully secured by the cash value of the policy and personal liquid assets of\nthe borrower or guarantor.\nResidential real estate loans consist of loans to individuals for the purchase of primary residences with repayment\nprimarily through wage or other income sources of the individual borrower. Primis’ loss exposure to these loans is\ndependent on local market conditions for residential properties as loan amounts are determined, in part, by the fair value\nof the property at origination.\nOther consumer loans are comprised of loans to individuals both unsecured and secured and home equity loans secured\nby real estate (closed and open-end), with repayment dependent on individual wages and other income. Other consumer\nloans also include Life Premium Finance loans and Panacea Financial consumer loans comprising of student loan\nrefinancing and pro re nata (“PRN’) loans. PRN loans may be utilized by graduating doctors to fund costs as they move\ninto their chosen professions. The risk of loss on consumer loans is elevated as the collateral securing these loans, if any,\nmay rapidly depreciate in value or may be worthless and/or difficult to locate if repossession is necessary. Losses in this\nportfolio are generally relatively low, however, due to the small individual loan size and the balance outstanding as\na percentage of Primis’ entire portfolio. Also included in other consumer loans are the Consumer Program loans as more\nfully described below in the Third Party Originated and Serviced Consumer Loan Portfolio section of this footnote.\nThe accrual of interest on all loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well\nsecured and in process of collection. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off at an earlier date if\ncollection of principal and interest is considered doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off is reversed against\ninterest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying\nfor return to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually\ndue are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nMost of Primis’ business activity is with customers located within Virginia and Maryland with some consumer loans’\ncustomer base on a national platform. Therefore, our exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the\n81\neconomy in those areas. We are not dependent on any single customer or group of customers whose insolvency would\nhave a material adverse effect on operations.\nPrimis has purchased, primarily through acquisitions, individual loans and groups of loans, some of which have shown\nevidence of credit deterioration since origination. These purchased loans are recorded at fair value such that there is no\ncarryover of the seller’s allowance for credit losses. We adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January\n1, 2020 which requires the Bank to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (PCD assets), defined as a\nmore-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the\nallowance for credit losses (“ACL”) expected at the time of acquisition. Under this method, there is no credit loss expense\naffecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are\nrecognized as credit loss expense (or reversal of credit loss expense) in subsequent periods as they arise. Any non-credit\ndiscount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be\nallocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective\nbasis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit\ndiscount or premium, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, shall be accreted to interest income using the\ninterest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date.\nA purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a PCD asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial\nasset. Generally, this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets through net income\nat the time of acquisition. In addition, both the credit discount and non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring\na pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as PCD assets is allocated to each individual asset. This combined\ndiscount or premium is accreted to interest income using the effective yield method.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Held-to-Maturity Securities\nThe allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in\naccordance with ASC 326 that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of held-to-maturity securities to present\nmanagement’s best estimate of the net amount expected to be collected. Held-to-maturity securities are charged-off against\nthe allowance when deemed uncollectible by management. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income\nstatement as a component of credit loss expense. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity\nsecurities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics and considers\nhistorical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nManagement has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities\nfrom the estimate of credit losses due to the inclusion in its nonaccrual policy. Further information regarding our policies\nand methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities is presented in Note 3 –\nInvestment Securities.\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Available-for-Sale Securities\nFor available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether (i) we intend to sell or (ii) it is\nmore likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either case\nis affirmative, any previously recognized allowances are charged-off and the security’s amortized cost is written down to\nfair value through income. If neither case is affirmative, the security is evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair\nvalue has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which\nfair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency and any adverse conditions\nspecifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present\nvalue of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If\nthe present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an\nallowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized\ncost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other\ncomprehensive income. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of credit loss\n82\nexpense. Management has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale\nsecurities from the estimate of credit losses due to the inclusion in its nonaccrual policy. Available-for-sale securities are\ncharged-off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed\nuncollectible by management or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Loans\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326,\nwhich is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present management’s best estimate of the net amount expected\nto be collected. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible by management. Expected\nrecoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. Adjustments to\nthe allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of credit loss expense. Management has made the\naccounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on loans from the estimate of credit losses due to the\ninclusion in its nonaccrual policy. Further information regarding our policies and methodology used to estimate the\nallowance for credit losses on loans is presented in Note 4 – Loans and Allowance For Credit Losses.\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance\nwith ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk\nresulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to\ncancel the obligation. The allowance is reported as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAdjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of other expenses. Further information\nregarding our policies and methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit\nexposures is presented in Note 15 – Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risks.\nThird-Party Originated and Serviced Consumer Loan Portfolio\nIn the second half of 2021, the Company partnered with a third-party (the “Third Party Originator/Servicer” or “TPOS”)\nto originate and service unsecured consumer loans through their proprietary point-of-sale technology (the “Consumer\nProgram”). Loan options under the Consumer Program include traditional fully-amortizing loans and promotional loans\nwith no interest, or “same-as-cash”, features if the loan is fully repaid in the promotional window. The loans are originated\nat par in the Bank’s name and have a term of 5 to 12 years with a much shorter effective life due to amortization and pay\ndowns.\nThe Consumer Program is governed by multiple interrelated agreements including the loan agreement between the\nBank and the customer and agreements with the TPOS. The structure of the Consumer Program is intended to generate\nloans that yield a targeted return to the Bank on a portfolio basis while also providing limited credit enhancement from the\nTPOS. Key characteristics of the combined arrangement include:\n• The TPOS contributes funds to a reserve account at the time of origination to be used for future charge-offs\nif necessary.\n• When a promotional loan pays off prior to the end of the promotional period, the customer owes no interest\non the loan and any interest accrued during the period is waived. In that event, the TPOS reimburses the Bank\nfor the interest the customer otherwise would have paid if the promotional period did not exist.\n• Excess yield on the portfolio after realized charge-offs and above an agreed upon target rate due to the Bank\nis paid to the TPOS as a “Performance Fee.”\n• In the event charge-offs exceed the amount available as a Performance Fee, the TPOS remits a portion of\ncurrent period originations to reimburse for losses and, if necessary, releases funds from the reserve account.\n83\n• If charge-offs exceed the amounts above, they roll over to future periods to offset potential Performance Fees\nand subsequent reserve account fundings related to the portfolio.\nAgreements with multiple counterparties, such as the customer and TPOS, are generally required to be accounted for\nseparately in accordance with U.S. GAAP relevant to each unit of account even if the agreements are highly interrelated.\nAs a result, the Company accounts for the Consumer Program under multiple units of account as follows:\n• The loans and related revenue are accounted for consistent with the Company’s accounting for its other loans\nheld for investment and are also included in the Company’s expected credit losses estimation process under\nCECL.\no No interest income is recognized on promotional loans until the expiration of the promotional period.\nIf the customer doesn’t pay off the loan prior to that expiration, deferred interest from the beginning\nof the loan becomes the obligation of the customer and is billed straight-line over the remaining life\nof the loan. We recognize the accumulated deferred interest at the time of expiration discounted for\nthe time value of money with the discount amortized over the remaining life of the loan.\n• The agreement that governs the “performance fee” and interest reimbursement from the TPOS meets the\ndefinition of a derivative financial instrument and is accounted for in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives\nand Hedging. The derivative is accounted for at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in\nother assets or other liabilities with changes in fair value each period reported in the Consolidated Statements\nof Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss) within noninterest income. The primary drivers of the\nderivative value include estimated prepayment activity on promotional loans that would trigger\nreimbursement to the Company from the TPOS and estimated excess yield above projected credit losses that\nwould lead to Performance Fee payments to the TPOS from the Company. Additional details on the inputs\nand assumptions used to determine the fair value of the derivative are discussed in Note 5, Derivatives.\no Noninterest income each period includes actual amounts received during the period for interest\nreimbursement and amounts paid by the TPOS under the limited credit enhancement described above.\no Noninterest expense each period includes actual amounts paid during the period for performance fees\nand servicing fees as defined in the agreement with the TPOS.\nThe Company has $199.3 million of loans outstanding in the Consumer Program, or 6% of our total gross loan portfolio,\nas of December 31, 2023. Loans in the Consumer Program are included within the Consumer Loan category disclosures\nin Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses. As of December 31, 2023, 45% of the loans were in a promotional\nperiod requiring no payment of interest on their loans with 70% of these promotional loan periods ending in the second\nhalf of 2024 through the first quarter of 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2023, $10.1 million of promotional\nloans paid off prior to the end of their promotional periods while $6.0 million of promotional loans reached the end of the\npromotional period and entered amortization.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, when accounting for loan participations and\nother partial loan sales. Transfers of an entire financial asset (i.e. loan sales), a group of entire financial assets, or a\nparticipating interest in an entire financial asset (i.e. loan participations sold) are accounted for as sales when control over\nthe assets have been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have\nbeen isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking that\nright) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the\ntransferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. Participations or other\npartial loan sales that do not meet the definition of a participating interest would remain on the balance sheet and the\nproceeds are recorded as a secured borrowing. Secured borrowings are initially recorded at fair value which corresponds\nto the proceeds received for the transfer of the assets, and any failed sale discount is amortized into income over the life\nof the related asset.\n84\nThe Company retains servicing rights on the loans sold and records a servicing asset for each of the sold loans at the\ntime of sale. Subsequent to the date of transfer, the Company can elect to measure servicing assets under the amortization\nmethod. Under the amortization method, servicing assets are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated\nnet servicing income. The amortization of servicing assets is analyzed each reporting period and is adjusted to reflect\nchanges in prepayment speeds, as well as other factors. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based on the fair\nvalue of those assets. Impairment is determined by assessing the servicing assets based on groupings of predominant risk\ncharacteristics, such as interest rate and loan type. If, by servicing asset grouping, the carrying amount of the servicing\nassets exceeds fair value, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to earnings. The valuation allowance is\nadjusted as the fair value changes. The Company recorded approximately $7 thousand of impairment of its servicing assets\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023. Servicing assets are included in other assets in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Company also retains servicing rights on loans transferred under secured borrowings,\nbut in accordance with U.S. GAAP does not record a servicing asset.\nThe principal balance of loans transferred for the year ended December 31, 2023 that qualified as sales was $52.2\nmillion, while the principal balance transferred that was accounted for as secured borrowings was $23.4 million. The\nCompany recorded $0.3 million of servicing assets during the year ended December 31, 2023 in connection with the\ntransfer of loans that qualified as sales. The balance of the servicing assets as of December 31, 2023 was $0.3 million. See\nNote 11 – Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings – for additional information on transfers\naccounted for as secured borrowings.\nBank Premises and Equipment\nLand is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Buildings and related\ncomponents are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives of 30 years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of\nthe related leases including lease renewals only when the Company is reasonably assured of the aggregate term of the\nlease. Furniture, fixtures, equipment and software are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging\nfrom 3 to 10 years.\nAssets Held for Sale\nThe Company classifies its assets as held for sale in accordance with FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\nWhen assets are identified as held for sale, the Company discontinues depreciating (amortizing) the assets and estimates\nthe fair value, net of selling costs, of such assets. Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of the net carrying amount\nof the assets or the estimated net fair value. If the estimated net fair value of the assets held for sale is less than the net\ncarrying amount of the assets, an impairment charge is recorded in the income statement.\nThe Company assesses the net fair value of assets held for sale each reporting period the assets remain classified as\nheld for sale. Subsequent changes, if any, in the net fair value of the assets held for sale that require an adjustment to the\ncarrying amount are recorded in the income statement, unless the adjustment causes the carrying amount of the assets to\nexceed the net carrying amount upon initial classification as held for sale.\nIf circumstances arise that the Company previously considered unlikely and, as a result, the Company decides not to\nsell assets previously classified as held for sale, they are reclassified to another classification. Assets that are reclassified\nare measured at the lower of (a) their carrying amount before they were classified as held for sale, adjusted for any\ndepreciation (amortization) expense that would have been recognized had the assets remained in their previous\nclassification, or (b) their fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases certain properties and equipment under operating leases. The Company recognizes a liability to\nmake lease payments, the operating lease liability, and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during\nthe lease term, the right-of-use asset. In recognizing lease right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities, we account for\n85\nlease and non-lease components (such as taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance costs) separately as such\namounts are generally readily determinable under our lease contracts. The operating lease liability is measured at the\npresent value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at inception. The\nright-of-use asset is measured at the amount of the operating lease liability adjusted for the remaining balance of any lease\nincentives received, any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent if the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term,\nany unamortized initial direct costs, and any impairment of the right-of-use-asset. Lease expense consists of a single lease\ncost calculated so that the remaining cost of the lease is allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis,\nvariable lease payments not included in the operating lease liability, and any impairment of the right-of-use asset. Lease\nrenewal options are generally not included in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities, unless they are not reasonably\ncertain to be exercised. The Company does not recognize short-term leases on the balance sheets.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company follows ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which prescribes the accounting for goodwill\nand intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally\ndetermined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests\nin the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill\nand intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized,\nbut evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant. Intangible assets\nwith definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the\nonly intangible asset with an indefinite life on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company performs its annual impairment analysis on September 30th of each year at the reporting unit level\nwhereby the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. The Company engaged a third-\nparty valuation specialist to assist management in performing its annual goodwill impairment analysis. Goodwill is\nrequired to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below\nthe operating segment level, which is referred to as a component. The Company’s reporting units for goodwill are its two\nprimary operating segments, Primis Bank and PMC. The Company completed the annual goodwill impairment testing for\nits two reporting units as of September 30, 2023. The testing for PMC concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit\nwas in excess of its carrying amount and no impairment charge was required. The Company’s testing of the Primis Bank\nreporting unit revealed that its carrying amount was in excess of its calculated fair value as of September 30, 2023, resulting\nin an impairment charge of $11.2 million.\nTo determine the fair value of the Bank and PMC reporting units, the Company utilizes a combination of three or four\nvaluation approaches: the comparable transactions approach, the control premium approach, the public market peers\ncontrol premium approach, and the discounted cash flow approach. The comparable transactions approach is based on\npricing ratios recently paid in the sale or merger of comparable banking franchises; the control premium approach is based\non the Company’s trading price, adjusted for holding company assets and an industry based control premium; the public\nmarket peers control premium approach is based on market pricing ratios of public banking companies adjusted for an\nindustry based control premium; and the discounted cash flow approach considers the earnings and cash flows that a\nhypothetical acquirer could realize in an acquisition of the Bank reporting unit. Assumptions that are used as part of these\ncalculations include: the selection of comparable publicly-traded companies and selection of market comparable\nacquisition transactions. In addition, other assumptions include the discount rate, economic conditions, which impact the\nassumptions related to interest and growth rates, the control premium associated with the reporting unit and a relative\nweight given to the valuations derived by the valuation methods.\nOther intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole-bank and branch acquisitions and\nother intangibles from the PMC acquisition and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 6 to\n15 years.\n86\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation cost is recognized for stock options issued to employees, based on the fair value of these awards at the\ndate of grant. A Black-Scholes option-pricing model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options. Compensation\ncost for grants of restricted shares is accounted for based on the closing price of Primis’ common stock on the date the\nrestricted shares are awarded. Compensation cost for stock options and restricted shares is recognized over the required\nservice period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized\non a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation cost for restricted stock unit\nawards that contain performance conditions is measured based on the grant date fair value of the units, adjusted for the\nCompany’s best estimate of the outcome of vesting conditions at the end of the performance period.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nPrimis has purchased, and acquired through acquisitions, life insurance policies on certain former and current key\nexecutives. Bank-owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the\nbalance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at\nsettlement.\nCloud Computing Arrangement Assets\nPrimis engaged third-parties to define, design, and develop a new cloud-based banking core for the Company. The\nmultiple phases of the cloud computing arrangement assets are assessed and reviewed as the software is placed into\nproduction. Total costs paid is capitalized upon initial launch and production rollout. Amortization is based on the\nestimated life of the core infrastructure as it relates to obsolescence, technology, competition, and the nature of changes in\nsoftware. Operating costs such as monthly licensing, usage, and storage are expensed as incurred in data processing\nexpense in our income statements. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had gross cloud computing\narrangement assets of $14.4 million and $11.5 million, respectively, and accumulated amortization of $3.8 million and\n$1.1 million, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nPremises and equipment, cloud computing arrangement assets, right of use assets, and other long-term assets (other\nthan goodwill and intangibles) are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be\nrecoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value.\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivatives are financial instruments that meet the criteria in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to be recognized as\neither freestanding or embedded derivatives. The Company’s derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded through noninterest\nincome in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss). Primis does not use derivative\ninstruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nConsumer Program Derivative\nThe Bank has an agreement with a third-party to originate and service consumer loans that are included in the Bank’s\nheld for investment portfolio. The third-party provides a target return to the Company on the portfolio of loans and all\ninterest received from borrowers above the target return is paid to the third-party as a performance fee. The third-party\nalso provides reimbursement for lost interest when the borrower’s note has a promotional feature that waives accrued\ninterest if the loan is paid in full before the promotional period ends and credit support to the Company in periods when\nthe target return on the portfolio is not achieved. This agreement to pay the third-party performance fees and to receive\nreimbursement of waived interest and certain credit support meets the definition of a derivative financial instrument. As\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company recorded an asset of $10.8 million and a liability of $0.1 million,\nrespectively, in its Consolidated Balance Sheets in the lines “Consumer Program derivative asset” and “Consumer Program\n87\nderivative liability” related to the third-party agreement accounted for as a derivative. See Note 5, Derivatives, for\nadditional information about the derivative and the assumptions used to determine its value.\nMortgage Banking Derivatives and Financial Instruments\nMortgage loan commitments known as interest rate lock commitments (“IRLCs”) that relate to the origination of a\nmortgage that will be held for sale upon funding are considered derivative instruments under the derivatives accounting\nguidance in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Loan commitments that are classified as derivatives are recognized at fair\nvalue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and other liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in\nmortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nTo-be-announced mortgage-backed securities trades (“TBA”) is a contract to buy or sell mortgage-backed securities\non a specific date while the underlying mortgages are not announced until just prior to settlement. These TBA trades\nprovide an economic hedge against the effect of changes in interest rates resulting from interest rate lock commitments.\nTBAs are accounted for under the derivatives accounting guidance in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging when either of\nthe following conditions exist: (i) when settlement of the TBA trade is not expected to occur at the next regular settlement\ndate (which is typically the next month) or (ii) a mechanism exists to settle the contract on a net basis. As a result, these\ninstruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as other assets and other liabilities with changes\nin their fair values recorded in mortgage banking income in the income statements. The fair value of the TBA trades is\nbased on the gain or loss that would occur if the Company were to pair-off the trade at the measurement date.\nForward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both best efforts and\nmandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Forward loan sale commitments that are mandatory\ndelivery are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be necessary to\nsettle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Forward loan sale commitments that are best efforts are\nnot derivatives but can be and have been accounted for at fair value, determined in a similar manner to those that are\nmandatory delivery. Forward loan sale commitments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as other assets and\nother liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in mortgage banking income in the income statements.\nAs of December 31, 2023 the Company recorded an asset of $0.6 million and a liability of $0.2 million in its\nConsolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, related to IRLCs, TBAs, and forward loan\nsale commitments (“mortgage banking derivatives”). As of December 31, 2022 the Company recorded an asset of $0.9\nmillion and a liability of $0.1 million in its Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and other liabilities, respectively,\nrelated to mortgage banking derivatives. See Note 5 for further discussion and assumptions used to value the derivatives.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk exposure in the normal course of business through its core lending\noperations. Primarily to help mitigate interest rate risk associated with its loan portfolio, the Company entered into interest\nrate swaps in May and August 2023 with a large U.S. financial institution as the counterparty. Interest rate swaps are\ncontractual agreements whereby one party pays a floating interest rate on a notional principal amount and receives a fixed-\nrate payment on the same notional principal, or vice versa, for a fixed period of time. Interest rate swaps change in value\nwith movements in benchmark interest rates, such as Prime or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Interest\nrate swaps subject the Company to market risk associated with changes in interest rates, changes in interest rate volatility,\nas well as the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to perform. The Company’s interest rate swaps are pay-fixed and\nreceive-floating whereby the Company receives a variable rate of interest based on SOFR.\nThe Company’s interest rate swaps meet the definition of derivative instruments under ASC 815, Derivatives and\nHedging, and are accounted for both initially and subsequently at their fair value. The Company assessed the derivative\ninstruments at inception and determined they met the requirements under ASC 815 to be accounted for as fair value hedges.\nFair value hedge relationships mitigate exposure to the change in fair value of the hedged risk in an asset, liability or firm\ncommitment. The Company’s interest rate swaps are fair value hedges that are accounted for using the portfolio layer\nmethod, which allows the Company to hedge the interest rate risk of prepayable loans by designating as the hedged item\na stated amount of two separate and distinct closed portfolios of consumer and commercial loans that are expected to be\n88\noutstanding for the designated hedge periods. Under the fair value hedging model, gains or losses attributable to the change\nin fair value of the derivative instruments, as well as the gains and losses attributable to the change in fair value of the\nhedged items, are recognized in interest income in the same income statement line item with the hedged item in the period\nin which the change in fair value occurs. The corresponding adjustment to the hedged asset or liability are included in the\nbasis of the hedged items, while the corresponding change in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded as\nan adjustment to other assets or other liabilities, as applicable. The Company presents interest rate swaps on the balance\nsheets on a net basis when a right of offset exists, based on transactions with a single counterparty and any cash collateral\npaid to and/or received from that counterparty are subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 the gross amounts of interest rate swap derivative assets and liabilities were $1.8 million and $0.7\nmillion, respectively, and are recorded net in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following table represents the carrying value of the portfolio layer method hedged assets and the cumulative fair\nvalue hedging adjustments included in the carrying value of the hedged assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAmortized Hedged Basis Amortized Hedged Basis\n(dollars in thousands) Cost Basis Asset Adjustment Cost Basis Asset Adjustment\nFixed rate assets $ 946,185 $ 248,906 $ (1,094) $ — $ — $ —\nAdditional information on derivative instruments can be found in Note 5 – Fair Value.\nRetirement Plans\nEmployee 401(k) plan expense is the amount of matching contributions from the Company. Primis matches 100% of\nthe first 3% of the employee contribution, and 50% of the next 3% (maximum of 4.5% match). Supplemental retirement\nplan expense incurred by the Company is accrued based on a future obligation to provide benefits to retired executives\nover a certain number of years after their service to the Company concludes.\nLoss Contingencies\nLoss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as\nliabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management\ndoes not believe there are such matters that will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nDividend Restriction\nBanking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to Primis\nor by Primis to shareholders.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs expensed during the twelve months ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021 were $1.8 million, $3.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets\nand liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between\ncarrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed,\nreduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nA tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in\na tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax\n89\nbenefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely\nthan not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. We have no unrecognized tax benefits and do not anticipate any increase in\nunrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. Should the accrual of any interest or penalties relative to\nunrecognized tax benefits be necessary, it is our policy to record such accruals in our income tax accounts; no such accruals\nexist as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nRestrictions on Cash\nNo regulatory reserve or clearing requirements with the FRB were needed as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents\nPrimis defines cash and cash equivalents as cash due from financial institutions, interest-bearing deposits and federal\nfunds sold in other financial institutions with maturities less than 90 days.\nEarnings Per Share (“EPS”)\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Primis’ common shareholders by the weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects additional common shares that would have\nbeen outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to net income that would\nresult from the assumed issuance. Potential common shares that may be issued by Primis relate solely to outstanding stock\noptions, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units and are determined using the treasury stock method.\nPerformance awards cannot be dilutive until the Company’s best estimate of the outcome of vesting conditions become\nprobable.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive\nincome (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available-for-sale which are also recognized\nas a separate component of equity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Credit Related Financial Instruments\nIn the ordinary course of business, Primis has entered into commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.\nThe face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn general, fair values of financial instruments are based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted\nmarket prices are not available, fair value is based upon observable market-based parameters. Valuation assumptions may\nbe made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These assumptions may reflect assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any\nsuch valuation assumptions are applied consistently over time.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU\neliminates the accounting guidance on troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for creditors in ASC 310-40 and amends the\nguidance on “vintage disclosures” to require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination. The ASU\nalso updates the requirements related to accounting for credit losses under ASC 326 and adds enhanced disclosures for\ncreditors with respect to loan refinancing and restructurings for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company\nadopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, which did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and disclosures.\n90\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging-Portfolio\nLayer Method, to expand the current single-layer method of electing hedge accounting to allow multiple hedged layers of\na single closed portfolio under the method. To reflect that expansion, the last-of-layer method was renamed the portfolio\nlayer method. The amendments in this update were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and\ninterim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the update in the second quarter of 2023 and applied the\nupdate to the derivatives the Company entered into during 2023.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures. This ASU expands current disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. Specifically, the ASU (i) requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), (ii) requires disclosure of an amount for other\nsegment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, (iii) requires providing in each interim period\nall current annual disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets, and (iv) allows an entity to provide\nadditional measures of profit or loss used by the CODM in assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources\nin addition to providing the measure for this that is most consistent with GAAP, (v) requires disclosure of the title and\nposition of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses reported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing\nsegment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and (vi) requires an entity that has a single reportable\nsegment to provide all disclosures required by this ASU and Topic 280. This ASU is effective for the Company’s annual\ndisclosures beginning for the year ended December 31, 2024 and its interim disclosures thereafter, with early adoption\npermitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU to its financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. This ASU requires annual disclosure of certain information relating to the rate reconciliation, income taxes\npaid by jurisdiction, income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated\nbetween domestic and foreign, and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal,\nstate, and foreign. The ASU also eliminates certain requirements relating to unrecognized tax benefits and certain deferred\ntax disclosure relating to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. This ASU is effective for the Company’s annual\ndisclosures beginning for the year ended December 31, 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU\nto its financial statement disclosures.\n91\n2.

With regard to U.S. Treasury and residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by the U.S. government, or agencies thereof, it is expected that the securities will not be settled at prices\nless than the amortized cost basis of the securities as such securities are backed by the full faith and credit of and/or\nguaranteed by the U.S. government. Accordingly, no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for these securities.\nWith regard to securities issued by States and political subdivisions and other held-to-maturity securities, management\nconsiders (i) issuer bond ratings, (ii) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (iii) whether issuers continue to make\ntimely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities and (iv) internal forecasts. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, Primis did not have a material allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 134 investment securities available-for-sale that were in an unrealized loss\nposition. The unrealized losses related to investment securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2023 or 2022, relate\nto changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and do not indicate credit-related\nimpairment. Primis performs quantitative analysis and if needed, a qualitative analysis in this determination. As a result\nof the Company’s analysis, none of the securities were deemed to require an allowance for credit losses. Primis has the\nability and intent to retain these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover all unrealized losses.\n94\nThe following tables present information regarding investment securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity in a\ncontinuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 by duration of time in a loss position (in thousands):\nL ess tha n 1 2 months 12 Month s or More To ta l\nDecember 31, 2023 Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nAvailable-for-Sale value Losses value Losses value Losses\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed\nsecurities $ — $ — $ 93,782 $ (13,826) $ 93,782 $ (13,826)\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 3,945 (19) 23,002 (3,714) 26,947 (3,733)\nCorporate securities 939 (61) 13,109 (1,891) 14,048 (1,952)\nCollateralized loan obligations — — 4,982 (36) 4,982 (36)\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage\nobligations — — 17,306 (1,631) 17,306 (1,631)\nGovernment-sponsored agency securities — — 13,711 (2,556) 13,711 (2,556)\nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities — — 30,110 (3,949) 30,110 (3,949)\nSBA pool securities 301 (1) 2,693 (52) 2,994 (53)\nTotal $ 5,185 $ (81) $ 198,695 $ (27,655) $ 203,880 $ (27,736)\nLess th an 12 months 12 Mo nth s or More To ta l\nDecember 31, 2023 Fair Unrecognized Fair Unrecognized Fair Unrecognized\nHeld-to-Maturity value Losses value Losses value Losses\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed\nsecurities $ — $ — $ 8,286 $ (754) $ 8,286 $ (754)\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 1,373 (4) 396 (38) 1,769 (42)\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized\nmortgage obligations — — 204 (15) 204 (15)\nTotal $ 1,373 $ (4) $ 8,886 $ (807) $ 10,259 $ (811)\nLess than 1 2 months 12 Month s or More To ta l\nDecember 31, 2022 Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\nAvailable-for-Sale value Losses value Losses value Losses\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed\nsecurities $ 23,484 $ (2,268) $ 79,283 $ (14,223) $ 102,767 $ (16,491)\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 10,026 (388) 17,609 (4,539) 27,635 (4,927)\nCorporate securities 14,828 (1,172) — — 14,828 (1,172)\nCollateralized loan obligations — — 4,876 (146) 4,876 (146)\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage\nobligations 22,343 (1,375) 4,252 (673) 26,595 (2,048)\nGovernment-sponsored agency securities 1,484 (16) 13,132 (3,087) 14,616 (3,103)\nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities 13,031 (371) 24,386 (4,392) 37,417 (4,763)\nSBA pool securities 529 (38) 3,243 (49) 3,772 (87)\nTotal $ 85,725 $ (5,628) $ 146,781 $ (27,109) $ 232,506 $ (32,737)\nLess tha n 12 months 12 Mo nt hs or More To ta l\nDecember 31, 2022 Fair Unrecognized Fair Unrecognized Fair Unrecognized\nHeld-to-Maturity value Losses value Losses value Losses\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed\nsecurities $ 9,457 $ (1,002) $ 58 $ (5) $ 9,515 $ (1,007)\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 1,255 (46) — — 1,255 (46)\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized\nmortgage obligations 75 (4) 181 (17) 256 (21)\nTotal $ 10,787 $ (1,052) $ 239 $ (22) $ 11,026 $ (1,074)\n95\n4. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe following table summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in\nthousands):\nD ecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nLoans held for sale, at fair value $ 57,691 $ 27,626\nLoans held for investment\nLoans secured by real estate:\nCommercial real estate - owner occupied (1) $ 455,397 $ 459,866\nCommercial real estate - non-owner occupied 578,600 579,733\nSecured by farmland 5,044 5,970\nConstruction and land development 164,742 148,690\nResidential 1-4 family 606,226 609,694\nMulti-family residential 127,857 140,321\nHome equity lines of credit 59,670 65,152\nTotal real estate loans 1,997,536 2,009,426\nCommercial loans (2) 602,623 520,741\nPaycheck Protection Program loans 2,023 4,564\nConsumer loans 611,583 405,278\nTotal Non-PCD loans 3,213,765 2,940,009\nPCD loans 5,649 6,628\nTotal loans held for investment $ 3,219,414 $ 2,946,637\n(1) Includes $7.7 million related to loans collateralizing secured borrowings.\n(2) Includes $12.8 million related to loans collateralizing secured borrowings.\nThe accounting policy related to the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical policy given the level of\nestimation, judgment, and uncertainty in the levels of the allowance required to account for the expected losses in the loan\nportfolio and the material effect such estimation, judgment, and uncertainty can have on the consolidated financial results.\nAccrued Interest Receivable\nAccrued interest receivable on loans totaled $20.1 million and $10.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNonaccrual and Past Due Loans\nLoans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date\nsuch payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be\nunable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining\nwhether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower’s\ndebt service capacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with\nregards to our collateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on nonaccrual\nstatus if (i) principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and\nin the process of collection or (ii) full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual\nstatus regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid\naccrued interest is reversed. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are\nreceived in excess of principal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts\ncontractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured,\nwhich is typically evidenced by a sustained period (at least six months) of repayment performance by the borrower.\n96\nThe following tables present the aging of the recorded investment in past due loans by class of loans held for investment\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\n30 -

Many aspects of the borrower’s financial situation are assessed when\ndetermining whether they are experiencing financial difficulty, particularly as it relates to commercial borrowers due to\nthe complex nature of the loan structure, business/industry risk and borrower/guarantor structures. Concessions may\ninclude the reduction of an interest rate at a rate lower than current market rates for a new loan with similar risk, extension\nof the maturity date, reduction of accrued interest, or principal forgiveness. When evaluating whether a concession has\nbeen granted, the Bank also considers whether the borrower has provided additional collateral or guarantors and whether\nsuch additions adequately compensate the Bank for the restructured terms, or if the revised terms are consistent with those\ncurrently being offered to new loan customers.\nThe assessments of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty at the time a concession has been granted\nis subjective in nature and management’s judgment is required when determining whether the concession results in a\nmodification that is accounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan under U.S. GAAP.\nAlthough each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately, for all portfolio segments, loans\nmodified as a result of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically modified through reductions in interest\nrates, reductions in payments, changing the payment terms from principal and interest to interest only, and/or extensions\nin term maturity.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, on an amortized cost basis, five other consumer loans totaling $288\nthousand, two loans secured by first liens totaling $949 thousand and two loans secured by owner occupied real estate\ntotaling $416 thousand were modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, representing 0.07%, 0.07% and\n0.21% of their respective total loan segments.\nIn the secured by first liens segment one loan, with an amortized cost of $857 thousand, resumed contractual payments\nin August after a six month deferral of principal and interest granted in the first quarter, and has experienced no payment\ndelinquencies since modification. Also in the secured by first liens pool one loan with an amortized cost of $92 thousand\n99\nwas modified in the fourth quarter to reduce principal and interest payments beginning November 2023 and is currently\n29 days past due. Prior to modification, total contractual payments for the quarter for this loan would have totaled $4\nthousand.\nTwo loans secured by owner-occupied real estate totaling $416 thousand in amortized cost were modified in the second\nquarter to allow for re-amortization of the balance over a 25 year period, while maintaining the original maturity date of\nFebruary and July 2027 and both loans have paid as agreed since modification.\nIn the other consumer loan segment, two loans to one borrower totaling $180 thousand in amortized cost received four\nmonths of principal and interest payment deferrals in the second quarter, and returned to contractual payments in August\n2023. Both loans are currently 90 days past due.\nOne loan with $63 thousand in amortized cost, was modified in the third quarter with reduced monthly payments of $3\nthousand for the remaining 84-month term with no change to the original rate or maturity. This other consumer loan is\npaying as agreed.\nIn the fourth quarter, one consumer loan, with $30 thousand in amortized cost was modified to interest only payments\nfor nine months, with principal and interest payments to resume June 2024. Total contractual payments, prior to\nmodification, for the quarter would have been $645. This other consumer loan is paying as agreed.\nAlso, in the fourth quarter, one consumer loan totaling $15 thousand in amortized cost restructured to interest only\npayments for eleven months, with a return to principal and interest payments in August 2024. Total contractual payments\nfor this loan prior to modification for the quarter would have been $549. This other consumer loan is paying as agreed.\nThe allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset\nupon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss\ninformation, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nBecause the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the\nallowance for credit losses because of the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the\nallowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. Occasionally, the Company modifies certain loans\nby providing principal forgiveness. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amortized cost basis of the loan is written\noff against the allowance. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of\nthe loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance\nfor credit losses.\nIf it is determined that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or\na portion of the loan) is written off. At that time, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount\nand the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nThrough its system of internal controls, Primis evaluates and segments loan portfolio credit quality using regulatory\ndefinitions for Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful. Special Mention loans are considered to be criticized.\nSubstandard and Doubtful loans are considered to be classified.\n100\nSpecial Mention loans are loans that have a potential weakness that deserve management’s close attention. If left\nuncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the\ninstitution’s credit position.\nSubstandard loans may be inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the\ncollateral pledged if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation\nof the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies\nare not corrected.\nDoubtful loans have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that\nthe weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly\nquestionable or improbable. Primis had no loans classified as Doubtful as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nIn monitoring credit quality trends in the context of assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses\non loans, we monitor portfolio credit quality by the weighted-average risk grade of each class of loan.\n101\nThe following table presents weighted-average risk grades for all loans, by class and year of origination/renewal as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nR evolving\nLoans\nRevolving Converted\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Loans To Term Total\nCommercial real estate -

The amount of\nthe allowance represents management’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on loans considering available\ninformation, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing collectability over the loans’ contractual terms,\nadjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate.\nIn calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics\nand risk profiles. For allowance modeling purposes, our loan pools include but are not limited to (i) commercial real estate\n- owner occupied, (ii) commercial real estate - non-owner occupied, (iii) construction and land development, (iv)\ncommercial, (v) agricultural loans, (vi) residential 1-4 family and (vii) consumer loans. We periodically reassess each pool\nto ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether\nfurther segmentation is necessary. For each loan pool, we measure expected credit losses over the life of each loan utilizing\na combination of inputs: (i) probability of default, (ii) probability of attrition, (iii) loss given default and (iv) exposure at\ndefault. Internal data is supplemented by, but not replaced by, peer data when required, primarily to determine the\nprobability of default input. The various pool-specific inputs may be adjusted for current macroeconomic assumptions.\nSignificant macroeconomic variables utilized in our allowance models include, among other things, (i) Virginia (VA)\nGross Domestic Product, (ii) VA House Price Index, and (iii) VA unemployment rates.\n105\nManagement qualitatively adjusts allowance model results for risk factors that are not considered within our\nquantitative modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools.\nQualitative factor (“Q-Factor”) adjustments are driven by key risk indicators that management tracks on a pool-by-pool\nbasis.\nIn some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which\ndifferentiate the loan from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit\nlosses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation.\nThe following tables present details of the allowance for credit losses on loans segregated by loan portfolio segment\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, calculated in accordance with ASC 326 (in thousands).\nC ommercial C ommercial Home\nReal Estate Real Estate Construction Equity\nOwner Non-owner Secured by and Land 1-4 Family Multi-Family Lines Of Commercial Consumer PCD\nDecember 31, 2023 Occupied Occupied Farmland Development Residential Residential Credit Loans Loans Loans Total\nModeled expected credit losses $ 3,981 $ 5,024 $ 2 $ 745 $ 4,559 $ 1,144 $ 332 $ 4,493 $ 20,098 $ — $ 40,378\nQ-factor and other qualitative\nadjustments 274 798 29 384 379 446 32 1,246 — — 3,588\nSpecific allocations — — — — — — — 581 5,990 1,672 8,243\nTotal $ 4,255 $ 5,822 $ 31 $ 1,129 $ 4,938 $ 1,590 $ 364 $ 6,320 $ 26,088 $ 1,672 $ 52,209\nCommercial Commercial Home\nReal Estate Real Estate Construction Equity\nOwner Non-owner Secured by and Land 1-4 Family Multi-Family Lines Of Commercial Consumer PCD\nDecember 31, 2022 Occupied Occupied Farmland Development Residential Residential Credit Loans Loans Loans Total\nModeled expected credit losses $ 5,297 $ 6,652 $ 4 $ 997 $ 3,579 $ 1,814 $ 310 $ 5,006 $ 3,851 $ — $ 27,510\nQ-factor and other qualitative\nadjustments 261 495 21 376 512 387 19 654 2 — 2,727\nSpecific allocations — — — — — — — 2,193 42 2,072 4,307\nTotal $ 5,558 $ 7,147 $ 25 $ 1,373 $ 4,091 $ 2,201 $ 329 $ 7,853 $ 3,895 $ 2,072 $ 34,544\nAs part of management’s ongoing review process and as an annual requirement, during the third quarter of 2023 the\nCompany refreshed and recalibrated the historical loss rates, forecast assumptions, and qualitative factor framework of the\nCECL model.

Qualitative reserve adjustments were driven by key risk indicators, that\nmanagement tracked on a pool-by-pool basis, which included loan-to-value, borrower debt service coverage exceptions\nand large concentrations. Updated peer groups were also determined in collaboration with the Company’s CECL\nconsultant.

The peer group population was further narrowed using statistical analysis with a focus on total loans,\npercent of charge-offs, portfolio yields, and percent of charge-offs during recession. While the asset range and geography\nwere unchanged from the prior iteration, changes in the Primis portfolio and the portfolios of other institutions resulted in\nchanges to the final peer groups. The most notable changes are in the commercial industrial and consumer peer groups.\nThe commercial industrial peer group displayed less risk, while the consumer peer group displayed more risk than the\nprior year. Other segments’ groups are mostly consistent. The loss given default values, applied to this year’s refresh,\ndecreased across all segments and resulted in downward reserve estimates. Generally, the updated loss drivers displayed\nlower default expectations as compared to the prior models.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company re-assessed the actual credit loss experience assumptions utilized in its CECL\nmodel related to the Consumer Program loan portfolio. Prior to this date the Company utilized a combination of credit loss\nhistory of the national consumer peer group as well as the limited credit loss experience in the Consumer Program portfolio\nas a whole in estimating credit losses for the portfolio. Based on the Company’s re-assessment it identified sustained trends\nover a sufficient period of time that should be considered in the assumptions used to model expected credit losses on the\nportfolio. Specifically, the Company identified credit loss trends correlated to borrower FICO bands and as a result credit\nloss history by borrower FICO band has been incorporated into the CECL model for the Consumer Program portfolio as\nof and for the year end December 31, 2023. The Company incorporated this change to the actual credit loss history\nassumptions because it determined the credit losses on this portfolio have been and are expected to continue to be\n106\nconcentrated in specific FICO bands and the continued use of less granular credit loss assumptions is not expected to be\nrepresentative of future expected credit losses in this portfolio. This change in the use of credit loss history based on FICO\nbands is accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s\nmodeled expected credit loss allowance for the Consumer Portfolio would have been $7.2 million higher using the prior\nassumptions.\nNo allowance for credit losses has been recognized for PPP loans as such loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA.\nActivity in the allowance for credit losses by class of loan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is\nsummarized below (in thousands):\nC ommercial C ommercial\nReal Estate Real Estate Construction Home Equity\nOwner Non-owner Secured by and Land 1-4 Family Multi-Family Lines Of Commercial Consumer PCD\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Occupied Occupied Farmland Development Residential Residential Credit Loans Loans Loans Total\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 5,558 $ 7,147 $ 25 $ 1,373 $ 4,091 $ 2,201 $ 329 $ 7,853 $ 3,895 $ 2,072 $ 34,544\nProvision (recovery) (1,303) (265) 6 (354) 1,453 (611) 62 373 33,579 (400) 32,540\nCharge offs — (1,170) — (2) (770) — (32) (2,854) (11,866) — (16,694)\nRecoveries — 110 — 112 164 — 5 948 480 — 1,819\nEnding balance $ 4,255 $ 5,822 $ 31 $ 1,129 $ 4,938 $ 1,590 $ 364 $ 6,320 $ 26,088 $ 1,672 $ 52,209\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 4,562 $ 9,028 $ 56 $ 998 $ 3,588 $ 3,280 $ 437 $ 4,088 $ 787 $ 2,281 $ 29,105\nProvision (recovery) 1,010 2,644 (31) 375 444 (1,079) (97) 3,167 5,047 (209) 11,271\nCharge offs (14) (5,027) — — — — (14) (1,040) (1,974) — (8,069)\nRecoveries — 502 — — 59 — 3 1,638 35 — 2,237\nEnding balance $ 5,558 $ 7,147 $ 25 $ 1,373 $ 4,091 $ 2,201 $ 329 $ 7,853 $ 3,895 $ 2,072 $ 34,544\nGenerally, a commercial loan, or a portion thereof, is charged-off when it is determined, through the analysis of any\navailable current financial information with regards to the borrower, that the borrower is incapable of servicing unsecured\ndebt, there is little or no prospect for near term improvement and no realistic strengthening action of significance is pending\nor, in the case of secured debt, when it is determined, through analysis of current information with regards to our collateral\nposition, that amounts due from the borrower are in excess of the calculated current fair value of the collateral.

DERIVATIVES\nConsumer Program Derivative\nThe Company has a derivative instrument in connection with its agreement with a third-party that originates loans that\nare held on the Company’s balance sheet. The third-party provides credit support and reimbursement for lost interest under\nthe agreement and the Company provides performance fees to the third-party on performing loans. Specifically, a portion\nof the originated loans are originated with a promotional period where interest accrues on the loans but is not owed to the\nCompany unless and until the loan begins to amortize. If the borrower prepays the principal on the loan prior to the end of\nthe promotional period the accrued interest is waived, but becomes due to the Company from the third-party under the\nagreement. This expected payment of waived interest to the Company along with performance fees due to the third-party\ncomprise the value of the derivative. The fair value of the derivative instrument was an asset of $10.8 million and a\nliability of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The underlying cash flows were $12.4 million\nand $1.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company calculates the fair value of this derivative\nusing a discounted cash flow model using inputs that are inherently judgmental and reflect management’s best estimates\nof the assumptions a market participant would use to calculate the fair value. The most significant inputs and assumptions\nin determining the value of the derivative are noted below ($ in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted\nLow High Average\nRemaining cumulative charge-offs $ 25,661 $ 35,334 $ n/a\nRemaining cumulative promotional prepayments $ 41,085 $ 75,086 $ 49,716\nAverage life (years) n/a n/a 1.0\nDiscount rate 4.63% 14.64% 14.64%\nDecember 31, 2022\nWeighted\nLow High Average\nRemaining cumulative charge-offs $ — $ 6,777 $ n/a\nRemaining cumulative promotional prepayments $ 26,211 $ 47,902 $ 30,251\nAverage life (years) n/a n/a 2.2\nDiscount rate 4.21% 14.25% 8.53%\n108\nMortgage Banking Derivatives and Financial Instruments\nThe Company enters into IRLCs (“interest rate lock commitments”) to originate residential mortgage loans held\nfor sale, at specified interest rates and within a specified period of time (generally between 30 and 90 days), with borrowers\nwho have applied for a loan and have met certain credit and underwriting criteria. The IRLCs are adjusted for estimated\ncosts to originate the loan as well as the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC (the\npullthrough rate). Estimated costs to originate include loan officer commissions and overrides. The pullthrough rate is\nestimated on changes in market conditions, loan stage, and actual borrower behavior using a historical analysis of IRLC\nclosing rates. The Company obtains an analysis from a third party on a monthly basis to support the reasonableness of the\npullthrough estimate.\nBest efforts and mandatory forward loan sale commitments are commitments to sell individual mortgage loans using both\nbest efforts and mandatory delivery at a fixed price to an investor at a future date. Forward loan sale commitments that are\nmandatory delivery are accounted for as derivatives and carried at fair value, determined as the amount that would be\nnecessary to settle the derivative financial instrument at the balance sheet date. Forward loan sale commitments that are\nbest efforts are not derivatives but can be and have been accounted for at fair value, determined in a similar manner to\nthose that are mandatory delivery. Forward loan sale commitments are recorded on the balance sheet as derivative assets\nand derivative liabilities with changes in their fair values recorded in mortgage banking income in the statement of\noperations.\nThe key unobservable inputs used in determining the fair value of IRLCs are as follows for the year ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022:\n2023 Inputs\nAverage pullthrough rates 77.20 %\nAverage costs to originate 1.36 %\n2022 Inputs\nAverage pullthrough rates 80.78 %\nAverage costs to originate 4.77 %\n109\nThe following summarizes derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 ($\nin thousands):\nDecembe r 31 , 2023\nFair Notional\nDerivative financial instruments: Value Amount\nDerivative assets (1) $ 611 $ 23,077\nDerivative liabilities $ 200 $ 62,250\n(1) Pullthrough rate adjusted\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Notional\nNon-derivative financial instruments: Value Amount\nBest efforts assets $ 91 $ 4,677\nDecember 31, 2022\nFair Notional\nDerivative financial instruments: Value Amount\nDerivative assets (1) $ 921 $ 25,368\nDerivative liabilities $ 98 $ 25,028\n(1) Pullthrough rate adjusted\nDecember 31, 2022\nFair Notional\nNon-derivative financial instruments: Value Amount\nBest efforts assets $ 18 $ 2,658\nThe notional amounts of mortgage loans held for sale not committed to investors was $46.2 million and $20.0 million\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company has exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non-performance by its trading counterparties in\nderivative instruments that the Company uses in its rate risk management activities. The Company manages this credit risk\nby selecting only counterparties that the Company believes to be financially strong, spreading the risk among multiple\ncounterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and by\nentering into netting agreements with counterparties, as appropriate.\n6. FAIR VALUE\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may\nbe used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability\nto access as of the measurement date\nLevel 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or\nliabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated\nby observable market data\nLevel 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions\nthat market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability\n110\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as\nthe general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy:\nAssets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis:\nInvestment Securities Available-for-sale\nWhere quoted prices are available in an active market, investment securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy. Level 1 investment securities include highly liquid government bonds and mortgage products. If\nquoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of investment\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow. Level 2 investment securities include U.S. agency securities,\nmortgage-backed securities, obligations of states and political subdivisions and certain corporate, collateralized loan\nobligations and other securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the\nvaluation, investment securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Currently, all of Primis’ available-\nfor-sale debt investment securities are considered to be Level 2 investment securities.\nLoans Held for Investment and Interest Rate Swaps\nThe Company entered into interest rate swaps on a portion of its loans held for investment portfolio that are accounted\nfor at fair value on a recurring basis. The swaps are valued using significant other observable inputs including prices\nobserved for similar exchange traded instruments and are therefore classified in Level 2. The related loans held for\ninvestment are measured using remaining designated cash flows of the hedged item based on the inception benchmark rate\ncomponent of the contractual coupon cash flows, discounted at the benchmark interest rate being hedged are therefore\nclassified in Level 2.\nLoans Held for Sale\nThe fair value of PMC loans held for sale is determined by obtaining prices at which they could be sold in the principal\nmarket at the measurement date and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value is determined\non a recurring basis by utilizing quoted prices from dealers in such securities.\nConsumer Program Derivative\nThe Company calculates the fair value of this derivative using a discounted cash flow model using inputs that are\ninherently judgmental and reflect management’s best estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use to\ncalculate the fair value. Key inputs utilized in valuing the derivative are discount rates, counterparty credit risk, credit loss\nrates, and prepayment rates. Discount rates considered observable benchmark interest rates and counterparty credit risk\nwas based on the Company’s evaluation of the counterparty’s financial condition in audited and unaudited financial results\nprovided. The credit loss and prepayment rates are informed by specific experience on the Company’s portfolio of the\nthird-party originated consumer loans that the derivative relates to and are considered significant unobservable inputs. As\na result of the use of the significant unobservable inputs the Consumer Program derivative is classified within Level 3 of\nthe valuation hierarchy.\nMortgage Banking Derivative and Financial Assets and Liabilities\nIRLC: The Company determines the value of IRLCs by comparing the market price to the price locked in with the\ncustomer, adding fees or points to be collected at closing, subtracting commissions to be paid at closing, and subtracting\nestimated remaining loan origination costs to the bank based on the processing status of the loan. IRLCs are classified\nwithin Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.\nBest Efforts Forward Loan Sales Commitments: Best efforts forward loan sales commitments are classified within\nLevel 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Best efforts forward loan sales commitments fix the forward sales price that will be\nrealized upon the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary market. Best efforts forward loan sales commitments are\nentered into for loans at the time the borrower commitment is made. These best efforts forward loan sales commitments\n111\nare valued using the committed price to the counterparty against the current market price of the interest rate lock\ncommitment or mortgage loan held for sale.\nMandatory Forward Loan Sales Commitments: Fair values for mandatory forward loan sales commitments are based\non fair values of the underlying mortgage loans and the probability of such commitments being exercised. Due to the\nunobservable inputs used by Primis, best efforts mandatory loan sales commitments are classified within Level 3 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nTo-Be-Announced Mortgage-Backed Securities Trades: Fair values for TBA’s are based on the gain or loss that would\noccur if the Company were to pair-off transaction at the measurement date and are classified within Level 3 of the valuation\nhierarchy. TBA’s are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:\nFair Value M e asurement s U s ing\nSignificant\nQuoted Prices in Other Significant\nActive Markets for Observable Unobservable\nTotal at Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(dollars in thousands) December 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed\nsecurities $ 96,808 $ — $ 96,808 $ —\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 30,080 — 30,080 —\nCorporate securities 14,048 — 14,048 —\nCollateralized loan obligations 4,982 — 4,982 —\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage\nobligations 34,471 — 34,471 —\nGovernment-sponsored agency securities 13,711 — 13,711 —\nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities 30,110 — 30,110 —\nSBA pool securities 4,210 — 4,210 —\n228,420 — 228,420 —\nLoans held for investment 248,906 — 248,906 —\nLoans held for sale 57,691 — 57,691 —\nConsumer Program derivative 10,806 — — 10,806\nMortgage banking financial assets 91 — — 91\nMortgage banking derivative assets 611 — — 611\nInterest rate swaps 1,068 — 1,068 —\nTotal assets $ 547,593 $ — $ 536,085 $ 11,508\nLiabilities:\nMortgage banking derivative liabilities $ 200 — $ — $ 200\nTotal liabilities $ 200 $ — $ — $ 200\n112\nFair Value M e asurement s U s ing\nSignificant\nQuoted Prices in Other Significant\nActive Markets for Observable Unobservable\nTotal at Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nResidential government-sponsored mortgage-backed\nsecurities $ 102,881 $ — $ 102,881 $ —\nObligations of states and political subdivisions 29,178 — 29,178 —\nCorporate securities 14,828 — 14,828 —\nCollateralized loan obligations 4,876 — 4,876 —\nResidential government-sponsored collateralized mortgage\nobligations 26,595 — 26,595 —\nGovernment-sponsored agency securities 14,616 — 14,616 —\nAgency commercial mortgage-backed securities 37,417 — 37,417 —\nSBA pool securities 5,924 — 5,924 —\n236,315 — 236,315 —\nLoans held for sale 27,626 — 27,626 —\nMortgage banking financial assets 21 — — 21\nMortgage banking derivative assets 945 — 921 24\nTotal assets $ 264,907 $ — $ 264,862 $ 45\nLiabilities:\nConsumer Program derivative $ 473 $ — $ — $ 473\nMortgage banking financial liabilities 4 — — 4\nMortgage banking derivative liabilities 122 — 115 7\nTotal liabilities $ 599 $ — $ 115 $ 484\nAssets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-recurring Basis:\nLoans\nWe may be required to measure certain financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair\nvalue usually result from the application of lower of amortized cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual\nassets due to impairment.\nCollateral-dependent loans are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are evaluated individually. These\ncollateral-dependent loans are deemed to be at fair value if there is an associated allowance for credit losses or if a charge-\noff has been recorded in the previous 12 months. Collateral values are determined using appraisals or other third-party\nvalue estimates of the subject property discounted based on estimated selling costs, generally between 5% and 10%, and\nimmaterial adjustments for other external factors that may impact the marketability of the collateral. The weighted average\ndiscount for estimated selling costs applied was 6%.\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets held for sale are valued based on third-party appraisals less estimated disposal costs. Primis considers third\nparty appraisals, as well as independent fair value assessments from realtors or persons involved in selling bank premises,\nfurniture and equipment, in determining the fair value of particular properties. Accordingly, the valuation of assets held\nfor sale is subject to significant external and internal judgment. Primis periodically reviews premises, furniture and\nequipment held for sale to determine if the fair value of the property, less disposal costs, has declined below its recorded\nbook value and records any adjustments accordingly.\n113\nAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below:\nFair Value M e asurement s U s ing\nSignificant\nQuoted Prices in Other Significant\nActive Markets for Observable Unobservable\nTotal at Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(dollars in thousands) December 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans $ 15,577 $ — $ — $ 15,577\nAssets held for sale 6,735 — — 6,735\nFair Value M e asurement s U s ing\nSignificant\nQuoted Prices in Other Significant\nActive Markets for Observable Unobservable\nTotal at Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\n(dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nCollateral dependent loans $ 47,832 $ — $ — $ 47,832\nAssets held for sale 3,115 — — 3,115\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amount, estimated fair values and fair value hierarchy levels (previously defined) of financial instruments\nwere as follows (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nDecembe r 31 , 2023 Decembe r 31 , 2022\nFair Value Carrying Fair Carrying Fair\nHierarchy Level Amount Value Amount Value\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents Level 1 $ 77,553 $ 77,553 $ 77,859 $ 77,859\nSecurities available-for-sale Level 2 228,420 228,420 236,315 236,315\nSecurities held-to-maturity Level 2 11,650 10,839 13,520 12,449\nStock in Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home\nLoan Bank Level 2 14,246 14,246 25,815 25,815\nPreferred investment in mortgage company Level 2 3,005 3,005 3,005 3,005\nNet loans Level 2 and 3 3,167,205 3,068,663 2,912,093 2,809,163\nLoans held for sale Level 2 57,691 57,691 27,626 27,626\nConsumer Program derivative Level 3 10,806 10,806 — —\nMortgage banking financial assets Level 3 91 91 21 21\nMortgage banking derivative assets Level 2 and 3 611 611 945 945\nInterest rate swaps Level 2 1,068 1,068 — —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDemand deposits and NOW accounts Level 2 $ 1,245,969 $ 1,245,969 $ 1,200,259 $ 1,200,259\nMoney market and savings accounts Level 2 1,578,288 1,578,288 1,057,151 1,057,151\nTime deposits Level 3 445,898 443,765 465,057 462,376\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase Level 1 3,044 3,044 6,445 6,445\nFHLB advances Level 1 30,000 30,000 325,000 325,000\nJunior subordinated debt Level 2 9,830 9,039 9,781 9,181\nSenior subordinated notes Level 2 85,765 84,513 85,531 84,347\nSecured borrowings Level 3 20,393 20,393 — —\nConsumer Program derivative Level 3 — — 473 473\nMortgage banking financial liabilities Level 3 — — 4 4\nMortgage banking derivative liabilities Level 2 and 3 200 200 122 122\nCarrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, loans held for sale, mortgage banking\nfinancial assets and liabilities, mortgage banking derivative assets and liabilities, Consumer Program derivative asset and\nliability, interest rate swaps, demand deposits, savings accounts, money market accounts, FHLB advances, secured\nborrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.\n114\nFair value of junior subordinated debt and senior subordinated notes are based on current rates for similar financing.\nCarrying amount of Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock is a reasonable estimate of fair value as these securities are\nnot readily marketable and are based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. The fair value of off-balance-sheet\nitems is not considered material. Fair value of net loans, time deposits, junior subordinated debt, and senior subordinated\nnotes are measured using the exit-price notion.\n7.

LEASES\nThe Company leases certain premises under operating leases. In recognizing lease right-of-use assets and related\nliabilities, we account for lease and non-lease components (such as taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance costs)\nseparately as such amounts are generally readily determinable under our lease contracts.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nPrimis has $93.5 million and $104.6 million of goodwill at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Goodwill is\nprimarily related to the acquisition of other banks before 2022 and PMC in 2022.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant. Our\nannual assessment occurs as of September 30th every year. For our annual 2023 assessment, as described in Note 1, we\nperformed a step one quantitative assessment to determine if the fair value of our reporting units were less than their\ncarrying amounts. The Company determined, based on the assessments, that the PMC reporting unit fair value was more\nthan the carrying amount and the Bank reporting unit fair value was less than its carrying amount. The Company recorded\nan impairment of $11.15 million in the December 31, 2023 income statement related to the Bank reporting unit.\nNo impairment was indicated in 2022 or 2021 for any of the Company’s reporting units based on the annual impairment\nassessments in prior years.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets were as follows at year end (in thousands):\nD ece m ber 31, 202 3\nGross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\nValue Amortization Value\nAmortizable intangibles $ 17,620 $ (15,662) $ 1,958\nD ece m ber 31, 202 2\nGross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\nValue Amortization Value\nAmortizable intangibles $ 17,620 $ (14,366) $ 3,254\n116\nEstimated amortization expense of intangibles for the years ended December 31 were as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 1,292\n2025 629\n2026 27\n2027 10\nTotal $ 1,958\n10.

In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, we will pledge\nadditional securities. We closely monitor collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained, while mitigating the\npotential risk of over-collateralization.\n11. SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AND OTHER BORROWINGS\nOther borrowings can consist of FHLB convertible advances, FHLB of Atlanta overnight advances, FHLB advances\nmaturing within one year, federal funds purchased, Federal Reserve Board Discount Window, secured borrowings and\nsecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repo”) that mature within one year, which are secured transactions with\ncustomers. The balance in repo accounts at December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had pledged callable agency securities, residential government-sponsored\nmortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with a carrying value of $6.8 million and $14.2\nmillion, respectively, to customers who require collateral for overnight repurchase agreements and deposits.\n117\nOther borrowings consist of the following (in thousands):\nDecem be r 3 1,\n2023 2022\nFHLB collateral advances maturing 10/15/2024 $ 30,000 $ —\nShort-term FHLB advances maturing 1/3/2023 — 50,000\nShort-term FHLB advances maturing 1/13/2023 — 100,000\nShort-term FHLB advances maturing 1/23/2023 — 50,000\nShort-term FHLB advances maturing 1/27/2023 — 125,000\nTotal FHLB advances 30,000 325,000\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase 3,044 6,445\nTotal $ 33,044 $ 331,445\nWeighted average interest rate at year end 5.57 % 4.19 %\nWe repaid our short-term FHLB advances of $325.0 million that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and\nmatured in the first quarter of 2023. As of December 31, 2023, Primis Bank had lendable collateral value in the form of\nresidential 1-4 family mortgages, HELOCs, commercial mortgage loans, and investment securities supporting borrowing\ncapacity of approximately $596.1 million from the FHLB, of which the Company has used $30.0 million.\nEach FHLB advance is payable at its maturity date, with a prepayment penalty for fixed rate advances paid off earlier\nthan maturity. Residential 1-4 family mortgage loans in the amount of approximately $364.6 million and $405.2 million\nwere pledged as collateral for FHLB advances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. HELOCs in the amount\nof approximately $31.6 million and $27.4 million were pledged as collateral for FHLB advances at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.

As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had borrowing capacity of $596.4 million within the program and has not\nborrowed under the program during the year.\nIn March 2023, the Federal Reserve established the Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) in response to industry\ndisruption, offering loans with up to one year in maturity to eligible depository institutions in exchange for pledged\ncollateral in the form of U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and other qualifying assets.\nBorrowing capacity under the BTFP is based on the par value, not fair value, of the collateral. As of December 31, 2023,\nwe had securities available of $117.2 million for utilization with the BTFP, but no borrowings were utilized during 2023.\nWhen the BTFP expires, the Bank plans to pledge qualifying securities to the Federal Reserve discount window.\nSecured Borrowings\nThe Company transferred $23.4 million in principal balance of loans to another financial institution in 2023 that were\naccounted for as secured borrowings. The balance of secured borrowings was $20.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and\nthe remaining amortized cost balance of the underlying loans was $20.5 million. None of the loans underlying the secured\nborrowings were past due 30 days or greater or on nonaccrual as of December 31, 2023 and were all internally rated as\n“pass” loans as presented in our “credit quality indicators” section of “Note 4 – Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses”.\nThe loans were included in our allowance for credit losses process and an allowance was calculated on the loans as part of\ntheir inclusion in a pool with other loans with similar credit risk characteristics. There were no charge-offs of the loans\nunderlying the secured borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2023. The underlying loans collateralize the\nborrowings and cannot be sold or pledged by the Company.\n118\n12. JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT AND SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES\nIn 2017, the Company assumed $10.3 million of trust preferred securities that were issued on September 17, 2003 and\nplaced through a trust in a pooled underwriting totaling approximately $650 million. At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthere was $10.3 million outstanding, net of approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of debt issuance\ncosts. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the interest rate payable on the trust preferred securities was 8.59% and 7.69%,\nrespectively.

Interest is payable at an initial annual fixed rate of 5.40% and after September 1, 2025, at a floating rate equal to a\nbenchmark rate, which is expected to be Three-Month Term SOFR, plus a spread of 531 basis points. As of December 31,\n2023, all of these notes qualified as Tier 2 capital.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior Subordinated\nNotes totaled $1.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\n13. INCOME TAXES\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 consist\nprimarily of the following (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nAllowance for credit losses $ 12,179 $ 8,370\nUnearned loan fees and other 3,054 2,161\nOther real estate owned write-downs — 38\nLease liability 2,635 1,246\nNet unrealized loss on investment securities available for sale 6,161 6,920\nFederal low income housing credit carryforward 492 485\nDeferred compensation 1,564 1,596\nCapitalized research and experimental expenditures 1,790 —\nNet operating loss 796\nOther 2,122 2,089\nValuation allowance (704) —\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 30,089 22,905\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nRight-of-use assets 2,449 1,200\nPurchase accounting 974 917\nDepreciation 767 748\nDerivative asset 2,424 —\nOther 1,080 166\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 7,694 3,031\nNet deferred tax assets $ 22,395 $ 19,874\n119\nThe Company had a valuation allowance of $0.7 million related to PFH recorded against deferred tax assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023. No valuation allowance was deemed necessary on deferred tax assets in 2022. Management believed\nthat the realization of the deferred tax assets was more likely than not based on the expectation that Primis will generate\nthe necessary taxable income in future periods.\nWe have no unrecognized tax benefits and do not anticipate any increase in unrecognized tax benefits during the next\ntwelve months. Should the accrual of any interest or penalties relative to unrecognized tax benefits be necessary, it is our\npolicy to record such accruals in our income tax accounts; no such accruals existed as of December 31, 2023, 2022 or\n2021. Primis and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, and Primis files Virginia and numerous\nother state income tax returns. Primis Bank files a North Carolina, a Maryland and an Arkansas state income tax return.\nThese returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities for all years after 2019.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in\nthousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent tax expense\nFederal $ 1,861 $ 5,982 $ 2,466\nState 771 503 163\nTotal current tax expense 2,632 6,485 2,629\nDeferred tax expense (benefit)\nFederal (2,699) (3,234) 5,937\nState (1,000) (66) 117\nTotal deferred tax expense (benefit) (3,699) (3,300) 6,054\nTotal income tax expense from continuing operations (1,067) 3,185 8,683\nTotal income tax expense from discontinued operation — — 64\nTotal income tax expense $ (1,067) $ 3,185 $ 8,747\nThe income tax expense differed from the amount of income tax determined by applying the U.S. Federal income tax\nrate of 21% to pretax income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 due to the following (in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nComputed expected tax expense at statutory rate $ (2,348) $ 3,640 $ 8,309\nIncrease (decrease) in tax expense resulting from:\nRemeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities (531) (148) 442\nLow income housing tax credits, net of amortization 1 4 39\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance (424) (419) (354)\nGoodwill impairment 2,342 — —\nResearch and development credit (1,150) — —\nValuation allowance 704 — —\nState taxes, net 503 158 242\nOther, net (164) (49) 5\nTotal income tax expense from continuing operations (1,067) 3,185 8,683\nTotal income tax expense from discontinued operation — — 64\nTotal income tax expense $ (1,067) $ 3,185 $ 8,747\nDuring 2023, the Company recorded an adjustment of $0.5 million to reflect remeasurement of deferred taxes and\nliabilities driven by state rate changes in 2023.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nPrimis has a 401(k) plan that allows all employees to make pre-tax contributions for retirement. The 401(k) plan\nprovides for discretionary matching contributions by Primis. The expense for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $1.4 million, $1.3\nmillion and $1.0 million, respectively.\nThe Bank previously maintained a deferred compensation plan in the form of Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan\n(“SERP”) for four (4) former executives. Under the plan, the Bank pays each participant, or their beneficiary, compensation\ndeferred plus accrued interest for a period of 15 to 17 years after their retirement or age 62 depending on the terms and\nconditions of each plan. A liability is accrued for the obligations under these plans.\nThe expense incurred for the deferred compensation plans in 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $0.3 million, $0.3 million and\n$0.4 million, respectively. The deferred compensation plan liability was $7.0 million and $7.4 million as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\n15. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe 2017 Equity Compensation Plan (the “2017 Plan”) has a maximum number of 750,000 shares reserved for\nissuance. The purpose of the 2017 Plan is to promote the success of the Company by providing greater incentives to\nemployees, non-employee directors, consultants and advisors to associate their personal financial interests with the long-\nterm financial success of the Company, including its subsidiaries, and with growth in stockholder value, consistent with\nthe Company’s risk management practices.\nA summary of stock option activity for 2023 follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average Aggregate\nAverage Remaining Intrinsic\nExercise Contractual Value\nShares Price Term (in thousands)\nOptions outstanding, beginning of period 203,300 $ 11.41 1.3 $ 102\nForfeited (4,000) 11.41\nExpired (131,000) 11.42\nExercised (13,500) 10.90\nOptions outstanding, end of period 54,800 $ 11.49 1.7 64\nExercisable at end of period 54,800 $ 11.49 1.7 $ 64\nThere were no stock-based compensation expense associated with stock options for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2023, we do not have any unrecognized compensation expense associated with\nthe stock options.\nA summary of time vested restricted stock awards for 2023 follows:\nW eighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nGrant-Date Remaining\nFair Value Contractual\nShares Per Share Term\nUnvested restricted stock outstanding, beginning of period 68,700 $ 14.24 2.4\nGranted 13,000 8.83\nVested (29,008) 13.71\nForfeited (12,392) 11.56\nUnvested restricted stock outstanding, end of period 40,300 $ 13.59 2.3\n121\nStock-based compensation expense for time vested restricted stock awards totaled $0.7 million, $0.4 million and $0.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, unrecognized\ncompensation expense associated with restricted stock awards was $0.3 million.\nA summary of performance-based restricted stock units (the “Units”) for 2023 follows:\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nGrant-Date Remaining\nFair Value Contractual\nShares Per Share Term\nUnvested Units outstanding, beginning of period 153,960 $ 13.02 3.6\nGranted 110,000 10.20\nForfeited (19,250) 12.86\nUnvested Units outstanding, end of period 244,710 11.77 3.1\nThese Units are subject to service and performance conditions. These Units vest based on the achievement of both\nconditions. Achievement of the performance condition will be determined at the end of the five-year performance period\n(the “Performance Period”) by evaluating the: 1) Company’s adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth\nmeasured for the Performance Period and 2) performance factor achieved. Payouts between performance levels will be\ndetermined based on straight line interpolation.\nThe Company recognized $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2023\nas a result of the probability of a portion of the Units vesting. During December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company did not\nrecognize any stock-based compensation expense associated with these Units because it was not probable that the Units\nwill vest. The grant date fair value of these Units was $10.20 and $11.83 per Unit for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. The potential unrecognized compensation expense associated with these Units was $4.4 million\nand $3.0 million, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK\nFinancial Instruments With Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nPrimis is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of\ncredit and guarantees of credit card accounts. These instruments involve elements of credit and funding risk in excess of\nthe amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by\nPrimis to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is\nessentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. We had letters of credit outstanding totaling $9.6\nmillion and $10.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for\ncommitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on the contractual amount of these instruments. We use the\nsame credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Unless\nnoted otherwise, we do not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.\nAllowance For Credit Losses - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance\nwith ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk\nresulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to\ncancel the obligation. Off-balance sheet credit exposures primarily consist of amounts available under outstanding lines\nof credit and letters of credit detailed above. For the period of exposure, the estimate of expected credit losses considers\n122\nboth the likelihood that funding will occur and the amount expected to be funded over the estimated remaining life of the\ncommitment or other off-balance sheet exposure. The likelihood and expected amount of funding are based on historical\nutilization rates. The amount of the allowance represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses on\ncommitments expected to be funded over the contractual life of the commitment. Estimating credit losses on amounts\nexpected to be funded uses the same methodology as described for loans in Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Credit\nLosses, as if such commitments were funded. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is\nreflected in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table details activity in the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures:\n2023 2022\nBalance as of January 1 $ 1,416 $ 977\nCredit loss expense 163 439\nBalance as of December 31 $ 1,579 $ 1,416\nCommitments\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition\nestablished in the contract. Commitments are made predominately for adjustable rate loans, and generally have fixed\nexpiration dates of up to three months or other termination clauses and usually require payment of a fee. Since many of\nthe commitments may expire without being completely drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily\nrepresent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.\nWe had $76.3 million of mortgage loan commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2023, all of which contractually\nexpire within thirty years.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had unfunded lines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds totaling\n$473.1 million and $540.6 million, respectively, not all of which will ultimately be drawn. Virtually all of our unfunded\nlines of credit and undisbursed construction loan funds are variable rate.\nPrimis also had commitments on subscription agreements entered into for investments in non-marketable equity\nsecurities of $1.6 million and $3.2 million, at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n123\n17.

REGULATORY MATTERS\nPrimis Financial Corp. and its subsidiary bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by\nthe federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly\nadditional discretionary - actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial\nstatements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (“PCA”), we\nmust meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance\nsheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to\nqualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. At December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under regulatory framework for\nPCA.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Primis to maintain minimum\namounts and ratios of Total and Tier I capital (as defined in the regulations) to average assets (as defined). Management\nbelieves, as of December 31, 2023, that Primis meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\n124\nThe following table provides a comparison of the leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios of Primis Financial Corp.\nand Primis Bank at the periods indicated to the minimum and well-capitalized required regulatory standards:\nRequ ire d\nFor Capital To Be Categorized as\nActual Adequacy Purposes Well Capitalized (1)\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nDecember 31, 2023\nPrimis Financial Corp.\nLeverage ratio $ 312,521 8.37 % $ 149,300 4.00 % n/a n/a\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 302,521 8.96 % 152,011 4.50 % n/a n/a\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 312,521 9.25 % 202,681 6.00 % n/a n/a\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 453,931 13.44 % 270,242 8.00 % n/a n/a\nPrimis Bank\nLeverage ratio $ 364,874 9.80 % $ 148,989 4.00 % $ 186,236 5.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 364,874 10.88 % 150,980 4.50 % 218,082 6.50 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 364,874 10.88 % 201,306 6.00 % 268,408 8.00 %\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 406,663 12.12 % 268,408 8.00 % 335,510 10.00 %\nDecember 31, 2022\nPrimis Financial Corp.\nLeverage ratio $ 316,956 9.52 % $ 133,154 4.00 % n/a n/a\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 306,956 10.07 % 137,135 4.50 % n/a n/a\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 316,956 10.40 % 182,847 6.00 % n/a n/a\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 436,649 14.33 % 243,796 8.00 % n/a n/a\nPrimis Bank\nLeverage ratio $ 373,225 11.24 % $ 132,850 4.00 % $ 166,063 5.00 %\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 373,225 12.40 % 135,487 4.50 % 195,703 6.50 %\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio 373,225 12.40 % 180,649 6.00 % 240,865 8.00 %\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 409,185 13.59 % 240,865 8.00 % 301,081 10.00 %\n(1) Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable at the bank holding company level.\nPrimis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank are required to meet minimum capital requirements set forth by regulatory\nauthorities. Bank regulatory agencies have approved regulatory capital guidelines (“Basel III”) aimed at strengthening\nexisting capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III Capital Rules require Primis Financial Corp. and\nPrimis Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%,\nplus a 2.5% “capital conservation buffer”, (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%,\nplus the capital conservation buffer, (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the\ncapital conservation buffer and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may\nresult in certain actions by regulators which could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nPrimis Financial Corp. and Primis Bank remain well-capitalized under Basel III capital requirements. Primis Bank had\na capital conservation buffer of 4.12 % at December 31, 2023, which exceeded the 2.50% minimum requirement below\nwhich the regulators may impose limits on distributions.\n125\n19. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company’s management reporting process measures the performance of its operating segments based on internal\noperating structure, which is subject to change from time to time. As of December 31, 2023, the Company operates two\nreportable segments for management reporting purposes as discussed below:\nPrimis Bank. This segment specializes in providing financing services to businesses in various industries and deposit-\nrelated services to businesses, consumers and other customers. The primary source of revenue for this segment is net\ninterest income from the origination of loans.\nPrimis Mortgage. This segment specializes in originating mortgages in a majority of the U.S. The primary source of\nrevenue for this segment is, noninterest income and the origination and sale of mortgage loans.\nPrior to the Primis Mortgage acquisition in 2022, we operated as one reportable segment.\nThe following table provides financial information for the Company’s reportable segments. The information provided\nunder the caption “Primis Bank” includes operations not considered to be reportable segments and/or general operating\nexpenses of the Company, and includes the parent company and elimination adjustments to reconcile the results of the\noperating segment to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP.\nAs of and f or the year ended Decem ber 31, 2023\nPrimis Mortgage Primis Bank Consolidated Company\n($ in thousands)\nInterest income $ 2,813 $ 189,805 $ 192,618\nInterest expense — 93,907 93,907\nNet interest income 2,813 95,898 98,711\nProvision for credit losses — 32,540 32,540\nNoninterest income 17,674 27,576 45,250\nNoninterest expense 20,153 102,447 122,600\nIncome before income taxes 334 (11,513) (11,179)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 3 (1,070) (1,067)\nNet income (loss) $ 331 $ (10,443) $ (10,112)\nTotal assets $ 66,282 $ 3,790,264 $ 3,856,546\nAs of and for the year ended December 31, 2022\nPrimis Mortgage Primis Bank Consolidated Company\n($ in thousands)\nInterest income $ 705 $ 122,582 $ 123,287\nInterest expense 2 21,585 21,587\nNet interest income 703 100,997 101,700\nProvision for credit losses — 11,271 11,271\nNoninterest income 5,055 13,297 18,352\nNoninterest expense 9,361 82,087 91,448\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (3,603) 20,936 17,333\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (752) 3,937 3,185\nNet income (loss) $ (2,851) $ 16,999 $ 14,148\nTotal assets $ 31,398 $ 3,535,266 $ 3,566,664\n126\n20.

The aggregate amount of these deposit accounts\nwere $38.3 million and $15.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n22. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nVariable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in\nthe fair value of an entity’s net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. The primary beneficiary is\ndefined as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s\n129\neconomic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the\nVIE.\nOur involvement with VIEs includes our investments in PFH, low income housing tax credit funds, and non-marketable\nand other equity securities.\nPFH\nPFH is a separate legal entity that owns the rights to the Panacea Financial brand and intellectual property with a goal\nof growing and monetizing those assets. The Panacea Financial Division of the Bank has a partnership agreement with\nPFH and is the primary bank partner as of December 31, 2023. The substantial activities between PFH and the Panacea\nFinancial Division of the Bank along with limited activities of PFH outside of its relationship with the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023, resulted in the Company concluding that it had a controlling financial interest in PFH and as the\nprimary beneficiary, the Company consolidated PFH as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, PFH had\napproximately $24.0 million of cash and a nominal amount of prepaid insurance assets and $3.1 million of accrued legal\nand other liabilities that are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. PFH’s cash is on deposit with the bank\nand it is eliminated in consolidation. PFH’s assets may only be used to settle PFH’s liabilities and PFH’s creditors do not\nhave any recourse to the Company related to PFH’s liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\ndid not provide any financial or other support to PFH that is was not contractually required to provide.\nLow Income Housing Tax Credits\nThe general purpose of housing equity funds is to encourage and assist participants in investing in low-income\nresidential rental properties located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, develop and implement strategies to maintain\nprojects as low-income housing, deliver Federal Low Income Housing Credits to investors, allocate tax losses and other\npossible tax benefits to investors, and to preserve and protect project assets. The Company applies the proportional\namortization method to its low income housing tax credits.\nNon-Marketable and Other equity investments\nThe Company also has a limited interest in several funds that focus on providing venture capital to new and emerging\nfinancial technology companies, which are accounted for as VIEs. Investments held by the Company in these third-party\nfunds do not have controlling or significant variable interests.\nThe above investments meet the criteria of a VIE, however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the entities,\nas it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities\nand their accounts are not included in our consolidated financial statements. The Company’s investment in the\nunconsolidated VIEs were carried as other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe low income housing tax credit funds were carried at $2.7 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Tax credits, net of amortization recognized related to these investments during the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022 were $1 thousand and $4 thousand, respectively. Additional capital calls expected for the funds totaled\n$0.2 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and are accrued for in other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe non-marketable and other equity investments were carried at $5.9 million and $4.4 million at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. We also make commitments on the subscription agreements entered into for the investments in\nnon-marketable equity securities. For additional details, see Note 16 – Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risks.\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss from unconsolidated VIEs is the higher of the investment recorded on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets or the commitment on the investment. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nmaximum exposure to loss for our unconsolidated VIEs was $10.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively.\n130\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and\nchief financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d -15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) utilizing the\nframework established in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information\nrequired to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement identified three material weaknesses during the year ended December 31, 2023, over the Company’s\ninternal controls over financial reporting. The material weaknesses were related to:\n(i) accounting determinations for transfers of financial assets including lack of a formally designed process and\nprocedure for evaluation of loan transfers. The existing procedures did not outline the process to be taken and\nindividuals to be involved in assessment of the proper accounting for loan transfers and were not sufficient\nenough to facilitate a proper conclusion on loan transfer transactions.\n(ii) the process for evaluation of credit losses on the third party managed consumer loan portfolio including\nevaluating recent actual loss history on the portfolio relative to previous model inputs. The existing process\nrelies on publicly available peer data for historical credit loss characteristics to inform our allowance\ncalculation because the portfolio is relatively new and did not have an extended credit loss history to serve as\nthe primary source of credit loss history when constructing the model. Management did not have a detailed\nprocess for review of recent actual portfolio loss trends and incorporation of those trends into the allowance\ndetermination.\n(iii) accounting evaluation for a complex agreement with a third-party that sources and manages a portfolio of\nconsumer loans for the Company. The existing process did not appropriately facilitate a thorough evaluation\nof the entire transaction and did not include the involvement of individuals with the necessary expertise to\nenable identification of complex accounting matters in the agreement and to conclude on them.\n(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management of Primis Financial Corp. is\nresponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Primis Financial Corp.\n(“we” and “our”), as that term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Primis Financial Corp. conducted an evaluation\nof the effectiveness of our internal control over Primis’ financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on the\nframework in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is not\neffective as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”)\nconcluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, at the reasonable assurance level,\nbecause of the material weaknesses in internal controls, which were disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form\n8-K on March 1, 2024 and the material weakness that resulted from the Company’s implementation of change to the\naccounting for a third-party managed consumer loan portfolio which was the subject of a “pre-clearance” consultation\n131\nwith the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant as described in Form 12b-25 on March 18, 2024, Amendment No. 1 filed\nApril 1, 2024, Form 12b-25 filed May 13, 2024, and Form 12b-25 filed August 12, 2024. Notwithstanding the material\nweaknesses, the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the consolidated financial\nstatements, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023, fairly present, in all\nmaterial respects, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash-flows for the periods presented in\nconformity with generally accepted accounting principles.\nRemediation Plans\n(i) Loan transfers\nManagement continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including\nimplementing additional internal controls over the identification of loan transfer transactions and management review of\nthe transactions. The Company has added additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance\nthe effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The material weakness will not be considered remediated\nuntil the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period. The Company has made progress in the remediation\nefforts related to the material weakness and anticipates the control weakness to be remediated by the end of 2024.\nThe Company’s remediation efforts include:\n• created a specific control in its quarterly financial close process to facilitate the identification of loan transfers\nand trigger an accounting review;\n• created a process to assess loan transfers in accordance with applicable accounting guidance;\n• established procedures to enable the accounting assessment in accordance with U.S. GAAP; and\n• developed criteria that facilitates the decision process for use of outside legal counsel to assist in evaluating\nthe legal isolation requirement.\n(ii) Third party consumer loan allowance\nManagement continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including\nimplementing additional internal controls over its allowance for credit losses process related to more timely review and\nincorporation of portfolio-specific credit loss trends its allowance calculation process for the third party managed consumer\nloan portfolio. The portfolio of consumer loans is relatively new and has a limited amount of loss history on which to rely\nin determining expected credit losses, which resulted in management using comparable peer credit loss data that was\npublicly available. However, recent portfolio performance has resulted in management considering the use of actual credit\nloss history more prominently in the allowance determinations as trends have started to become present that are in deviation\nfrom the publicly available peer loss data. As a result, management is currently implementing efforts to:\n• compile more asset quality information on the consumer portfolio from the third party that is managing the\nportfolio;\n• obtain the third party’s projections of future credit losses of the portfolio for analysis and consideration in\nour expected credit loss calculations; and\n• collaborate with the third party to implement a process to receive actual credit loss history and projections\non a more timely basis to enable us to assess the information and incorporate it into our credit loss estimates.\n(iii) Third-party managed loan agreement\nManagement continues to review and make changes to the overall design of its internal control environment, including\nimplementing additional internal controls over the identification of complex agreements the Company enters into and\nensuring the appropriate level of review of these agreements by an individual with the requisite accounting expertise. The\nCompany is adding additional internal controls to its financial close and reporting process to enhance the effectiveness of\ninternal controls over financial reporting to require appropriate levels of accounting management review of new\ntransactions. Additionally, the Company will seek appropriate third-party accounting expertise when it determines a\ntransaction contains complex arrangements that management does not have sufficient expertise to assess and conclude\n132\nupon. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a\nsufficient period.\nManagement may determine that additional measures are required to address control deficiencies, strengthen internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, or it may determine to modify the remediation measures described above. The actions the\nCompany is taking are subject to ongoing executive management review and are also subject to Audit Committee\noversight. If the Company is unable to successfully remediate the material weaknesses, or if in the future, the Company\nidentifies further material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not detect errors\non a timely basis, and its condensed consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated.\nForvis Mazars, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control\nover financial reporting, which report is included in “Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. As a result of the acquisition of Primis Mortgage, the Company\nintegrated Primis Mortgage into its internal control over financial reporting process during the year ended December 31,\n2023. Except for the changes in connection with this integration of Primis Mortgage and the material weaknesses noted\nabove, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial\nreporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, there were no Rule 10b5-1 plans or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangements adopted, modified or terminated by any director or officer of the Company.\nAs previously reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2024, the Company will be\nrestating its financial statements for each of the first three quarters of 2023. In connection with the restatement, and as\nsoon as practicable, the Company will file amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A as of and for the three months\nended March 31, 2023, as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, and as of and for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. In addition, the Company presently anticipates that it will file an Amended Current\nReport on Form 8-K/A in respect of and to restate the Company’s most recent earnings release and investor presentation.\nThe Company also anticipates filings its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2024, which have been delayed due to the late filing of this Form 10-K, as soon as\npracticable after filing this Form 10-K.\nPART III\nItem 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nBoard of Directors\nThe Board of Directors currently consists of ten directors. In accordance with the Company’s Amended and Restated\nBylaws, members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III. The members of\neach class are elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders following their\nelection.\nAny director vacancy occurring after the election may be filled only by a majority vote of the remaining directors, even\nif there is less than a quorum of the Board of Directors.\nThe biographies of the directors and executive officers below contains information regarding the person’s service as a\ndirector and/or executive officer, business experience, director positions held currently or at any time during the last\nfive years, information regarding involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings, if applicable, and the\n133\nexperiences, qualifications, attributes or skills that caused the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors\nto determine that the person should serve as a director and/or executive officer.Members of the Company’s and the Bank’s\nBoard of Directors are expected to have the appropriate skills and characteristics necessary to function in the Company\nand Bank’s current operating environment and contribute to its future direction and strategies. These include legal,\nfinancial, management and other relevant skills. In addition, the Company looks to achieve a diversified Board, including\nmembers with varying experience, age, perspective, residence, background, race, gender, and other demographic\ncharacteristics.\nThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to the Company’s Class I, Class II and Class III\ndirectors, and the executive officers of the Company and the Bank who are not also directors:\nName Age Positions with the Company and Bank\nDirectors:\nJohn F.

Executive Compensation\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThis section discusses the Company’s compensation program, including how it relates to the executive officers named\nin the compensation tables that follow (who we sometimes refer to below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K as the “named executive officers”). The executive officers of the Company currently hold the same executive officer\npositions with the Bank and all executive compensation is paid by the Bank for services performed by executives of the\nBank. Accordingly, the following discussion of executive compensation relates to the compensation by the Bank to\nexecutives of the Bank.\nThe primary objective of our executive compensation program is to attract, retain and motivate key employees and\nenable those persons to participate in the long-term success of the Company while also advancing the interests of our\nstockholders. As such, the compensation program is designed to provide levels of compensation which are reflective of\nboth the individual’s and the organization’s performance in achieving certain goals and objectives and in helping to build\nvalue for our stockholders. Set forth below is an analysis of our compensation program, the material compensation policy\ndecisions we have made under this program and the material factors that we considered in making those decisions. Our\nnamed executive officers (the “NEOs”) are:\n• Dennis J. Zember, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer\n• Matthew A. Switzer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;\n• Rickey A. Fulk(1), Executive Vice President;\n• G. Cody Sheflett, Jr.(2), former Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Information Officer;\nand\n• Ann-Stanton C. Gore, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer.\n(1) Mr. Fulk was appointed Executive Vice President on October 2, 2023.\n(2) Mr. Sheflett passed away on January 16, 2024.\nOverview of Compensation Program\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for developing and making recommendations\nto the Board with respect to the Company’s executive compensation policies. John F. Biagas, Robert Y. Clagett, and F.L.\nGarrett III serve on the Compensation Committee (the “Compensation Committee”). The Compensation Committee, along\nwith the Board, has reviewed the compensation policies and practices for all employees and concluded that any risks\narising from such policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nThe fundamental objectives of the Bank’s executive compensation policies are to ensure that Bank executives are\nprovided incentives and compensated in a way that advances both the short- and long-term interests of stockholders while\nalso ensuring that the Company and the Bank are able to attract, retain and motivate executive management talent.\nAccordingly, compensation is based on: (1) the employee’s individual performance and his or her ability to lead the\nCompany and the Bank to achieve their respective financial goals, (2) the Company’s consolidated financial performance\nand (3) compensation compared to peer institutions’ executive compensation. In making decisions with respect to any\n139\nelement of an executive officer’s compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the total compensation that may\nbe awarded to the executive officer, including salary, annual bonus, long-term equity incentive compensation, accumulated\nrealized and unrealized stock option gains, and the dollar value to the executive and cost to the Company of all perquisites\nand other personal benefits. The Compensation Committee’s goal is to award compensation that is reasonable when all\nelements of potential compensation are considered.\nThe Compensation Committee believes tying compensation to Company performance is critical for ensuring\nmanagement alignment with shareholders, particularly for CEO compensation. As discussed further below, executive\ncompensation in 2023 was heavily influenced by the Company’s earnings performance for the year.\nSetting Executive Compensation\nIn reviewing the 2023 compensation of each of our executive officers, the Compensation Committee reviewed all\ncomponents of his or her respective compensation, including base salary, annual bonus, long-term equity incentive\ncompensation, accumulated realized and unrealized stock option gains, and the dollar value to the executive and cost to\nthe Company of all perquisites and other personal benefits. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviewed each\nexecutive officer’s compensation history and performance information and the market data discussed below.\nRole of Compensation Consultant and Market Data\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer (the “Consultant”) to provide advice with respect to\nexecutive officer and director compensation for 2023. The Consultant periodically attended the Compensation\nCommittee’s meetings, including executive sessions, and provided information and advice independent of management\nand, at the direction of the Compensation Committee Chairman, assisted management with various activities that support\nthe Company’s executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee considered the independence of the\nConsultant in light of the SEC rules and NASDAQ listing standards and concluded that the work of the Consultant did not\nraise any conflicts of interest. The Consultant did not provide any services to the Company other than executive\ncompensation-related services.\nThe Consultant reviewed a peer group comprised of 24 mid-Atlantic U.S. banks ranging in assets from $2.3 billion to\n$6.0 billion, with median assets of $3.2 billion and median market cap of $406 million. The peer group consisted of the\nfollowing banks: ACNB Corporation, American National Bankshares, Blue Ridge Bankshares, C&F Financial\nCorporation, Capital City Bank Group, CapStar Financial Holdings, Carter Bankshares, City Holding, CNB Financial,\nCodorus Valley Bancorp, Colony Bankcorp, First Bank, First Community Bancshares, HomeTrust Bancshares, MetroCity\nBankshares, Mid Penn Bancorp, MVB Financial, Orrstown Financial Services, Peoples Financial Services,\nSmartFinancial Inc., Southern First Bancshares, Summit Financial Group, Shore Bancshares, Inc. and Wilson Bank\nHolding Company. The Consultant reviewed base salary, total cash compensation, targeted total cash compensation and\ntargeted total direct compensation of our executive officers as compared to the peer group.\nThe Company did not benchmark the compensation of its named executive officers to a certain percentage or range\nof compensation within the market data provided by the Consultant. Instead, the Compensation Committee used this\ninformation as a point of reference for measurement, but not as the determinative factor in setting the compensation of the\nCompany’s named executive officers. The Compensation Committee did not use the compensation data to “target” a\nspecific compensation level for any given executive. Rather, the Compensation Committee used its understanding of peer\ngroup compensation as a starting point for its decision making.\nBecause the comparative compensation information is just one of the analytical tools that are used in setting named\nexecutive officer compensation, the Compensation Committee has discretion in determining the nature and extent of its\nuse. Further, given the limitations associated with comparative pay information for setting individual executive\ncompensation, including the difficulty of assessing and comparing wealth accumulation through equity gains and post-\nemployment amounts, the Compensation Committee may elect not to use the comparative compensation information at\nall in the course of making compensation decisions.\n140\nRole of Executives in Establishing Compensation\nIn early 2023, the Compensation Committee made all decisions with respect to compensation of Mr. Zember, subject\nto review and approval by the full Board of Directors. Mr. Zember reviewed the performance of the Company’s executive\nofficers (other than himself) and, based on that review, recommended to the Compensation Committee amounts payable\nto such other executive officers, including the other named executive officers. Mr. Zember was not involved with any\naspect of determining his own pay.\nConsideration of Last Year’s Advisory Stockholder Vote on Executive Compensation\nAt the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2023 Annual Meeting”), approximately 94% of the shares\nrepresented and entitled to vote at the annual meeting were voted to approve the compensation of the Company’s named\nexecutive officers, as discussed and disclosed in the proxy statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting. The Compensation\nCommittee concluded that the results of the advisory say-on-pay vote reflected stockholder support of our compensation\nprogram. In light of this support, the Compensation Committee did not make material changes to our executive\ncompensation program.\nComponents of Executive Compensation\nThe principal components of the executive compensation program of the Company (through the Bank) are:\n• base salary;\n• cash incentive awards;\n• long-term equity incentive awards;\n• perquisites and other personal benefits; and\n• severance protection through employment agreements.\nBase Salary\nSalaries provide executive officers with a base level of monthly income and help achieve the objectives outlined above\nby attracting and retaining strong talent. Generally, base salaries are not based on specific measures of corporate\nperformance, but are determined by tenure of service, scope of the position, including current job responsibilities, relative\nsalaries of the Company’s peers and the officer’s individual performance and contribution to the Company. The\nCompany’s base salaries are adjusted based on factors such as individual experience, individual performance, individual\npotential, cost of living considerations and specific issues particular to the Company as well as the Compensation\nCommittee’s subjective judgment. The Compensation Committee monitors the base salary levels and the various\nincentives of the named executive officers of the Company to ensure that overall compensation is consistent with the\nCompany’s objectives and remains competitive within the area of the Company’s operations.\nEffective March 1, 2023, the Compensation Committee approved an increase to the base salary of the following\nexecutive officers: Mr. Zember, 5.0% to $674,872; Mr. Switzer, 4.8% to $329,994; Mr. Fulk, 19.4% to $225,722;\nMr. Sheflett, 5.3% to $299,984 and Ms. Gore, 4.0% to $256,160. Effective April 1, 2023, the Compensation Committee\napproved an increase to the base salary of Mr. Fulk, 11.1% to $250,799 and effective September 28, 2023, the\nCompensation Committee further approved an increase to the base salary of Mr. Fulk, 20.0% to $300,959 in connection\nwith his promotion to Executive Vice President.\n141\nNon-Equity Incentive Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee spent considerable time in 2023, in coordination with the full Board of Directors and\nthe CEO, aligning targets for incentive pay with the Company’s short-term goals. In 2023, the Compensation Committee\nestablished the following goals with high and low ranges of achievement around the target and with each goal weighted\nequally:\nIncentive P ay out Rates Ve rs us Targets\nFinancial Measure Weighting 75% 100% 125% Actual\nNet Income as Percent of Budget(1) 35% 90% 100% 110% 72%\nNon-Brokered Deposit Growth(2) 25% 10% 15% 20% 25%\nGross Loan Growth(3) 20% 6% 8% 10% 9%\nYear-End Nonperforming Assets / Assets(4) 20% 0.50% 0.19%\n(1) Reported net income for 2023, adjusted for certain one-time items, as a percentage of budgeted net income for 2023.\n(2) Represents growth in non-brokered deposits from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023.\n(3) Represents growth in gross loans held for investment, excluding Paycheck Protection Program balances, from\nDecember 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023.\n(4) Represents the level of nonperforming assets to total assets by December 31, 2023. This metric was measured on a\npass or fail basis in the incentive plan.\nTargets incentive percentages of base salary were determined for executive management. These targets combined\nwith the payout ranges above would determine short-term incentives. The following table shows the target incentive payout\nlevels for each named executive assuming midpoint performance on the established goals:\nC alculated\nTarget Incentive Actual\nTarget Incentive Payment Incentive Actual\nNamed Executive Salary ($) (% of Salary) Payment ($) (at 74%) ($) Payment ($) (% of Salary)\nDennis J. Zember, Jr. $ 674,872 50% $ 337,436 $ 249,703 $ — 0%\nMatthew A. Switzer 329,994 35% 115,498 85,468 — 0%\nRickey A. Fulk 300,959 30% 90,288 66,813 — 0%\nG. Cody Sheflett 299,984 35% 104,994 77,696 — 0%\nAnn-Stanton C. Gore 256,160 30% 76,848 56,868 — 0%\nAs noted above, actual results relative to 2023 goals implied a payout of 74% of targeted incentive amounts for the\nyear. However, the Compensation Committee noted that, while progress on multiple strategic initiatives was made in 2023,\nnet income for the year was below expectations. As a result, the Compensation Committee used its discretion to eliminate\nshort-term incentive payments for executive management for 2023.\n142\nLong-Term Equity Incentive Awards\nThe Company maintains an equity compensation program for its named executive officers and other key employees,\nin order to attract, retain and motivate key employees and enable those persons to participate in the long-term success of\nthe Company. In 2021, the Compensation Committee began including performance-based grants in management’s long-\nterm equity incentive awards to increase the alignment of management incentives with long-term goals versus time-based\ngrants alone. For 2022 and 2023, the Compensation Committee chose to make all awards performance-based. The\nperformance-based restricted stock units are convertible, on a one-for-one basis, into shares of stock based on the level of\nachievement of the Company’s adjusted earnings per share compound annual growth over the 5-year performance period\ncommencing the year of the grant. The following table details the performance targets and payout levels for the 2022 and\n2023 performance unit grants.\nAdjusted E PS CAGR(1) Payout\n2022 2023 Factor\n12% 10% 150%\n10% 8% 100%\n8% 6% 75%\n6% 5% 50%\n< 6% < 5% 0%\n(1) Calculated as the five year compound annual growth rate in credit-adjusted pre-tax operating earnings per share\nbeginning the year of the grant.\nAmendment to Mr. Zember’s Performance Units. During 2023, the Compensation Committee amended Mr. Zember’s\n2021 and 2022 performance units (collectively, the “Zember Performance Unit Amendment”) to provide that (i) with\nrespect to the 2021 performance units, to the extent that the Company meets the performance targets that would entitle Mr.\nZember to earn more than 50,000 shares upon settlement of the award in 2026 (or, in certain limited circumstances, an\nearlier date as provided in the award agreement), Mr. Zember’s award will be limited at 50,000 shares of stock and he will\nbe entitled to the cash value of any shares earned in excess of 50,000 (with the value of any cash awards received by Mr.\nZember in 2026 limited to $500,000); and (ii) with respect to the 2022 performance units, to the extent that the Company\nmeets the performance targets that would entitle Mr. Zember to earn more than 50,000 shares upon settlement of the award\nin 2027 (or, in certain limited circumstances, an earlier date as provided in the award agreement), Mr. Zember’s award\nwill be limited at 25,233 shares of stock, and he will be entitled to the cash value of any shares earned in excess of 25,233\n(with the value of any cash awards received by Mr. Zember in 2027 limited to $500,000). The terms of Mr. Zember’s 2023\nperformance units are consistent with those provided in the Zember Performance Unit Amendment.\nPerquisites and Employee Benefit Plans\nPerquisites represent a small part of the Company’s executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee\nreviews annually the perquisites provided to the named executive officers, and offers such benefits after consideration of\nthe business need. The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the same employee benefits plans that are\ngenerally available to all Company employees.\nEmployment Agreements\nDuring 2023, the Company and the Bank were party to employment agreements with our named executive officers.\nThe Compensation Committee and the Bank believe that the employment and change-in-control agreements are a critical\ntool in retaining our executive team. These agreements also include certain protections for the Company and the Bank in\nthe form of post-employment restrictive covenants.\nEmployment Agreement with Mr. Zember. Effective December 20, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and\nrestated employment agreement with Mr. Zember, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank.\nThe amended and restated agreement amends and restates in its entirety the original employment agreement with\n143\nMr. Zember, dated February 19, 2020 (the “Original Employment Agreement”). The amended and restated employment\nagreement is substantially the same as the Original Employment Agreement, except as described herein. Pursuant to the\namended and restated agreement, Mr. Zember’s base salary was set at $642,735 to align with his 2022 base salary, with\neligibility for annual increases at the Compensation Committee’s discretion, and the Company committed to providing\nMr. Zember life insurance in the amount of $5,000,000, with fifty percent (50%) of the proceeds directed to the Company\nand fifty percent (50%) of the proceeds directed to Mr. Zember’s designated beneficiary. The amended and restated\nagreement also provides that if Mr. Zember’s employment is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason\nfollowing a change in control, then his performance-based equity awards will be deemed to have been earned as of his\ntermination date based upon the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance goals measured as of the date of\nsuch termination.\nEmployment Agreement with Mr. Switzer.

In the event of a restatement of the reported financial results\nof the Company due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, the Compensation Committee will\nrecover reasonably promptly the amount of all erroneously awarded compensation received by a current or former\nexecutive officer during the covered period (within the meaning of such terms as provided in the NASDAQ listing\nstandards).\n144\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with\nmanagement and, based on such review, has recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Compensation Committee\nJohn F.

The following\ndiscusses the Company’s approach to director compensation.\nStock Ownership Policy\nIn December of 2022, the Board adopted stock ownership guidelines for directors of the Company to further align the\nBoard’s long-term interests with those of the Company’s stockholders. Before their third anniversary as a board member,\ndirectors must own unencumbered shares with a minimum value equal to 100% of the average annual board compensation.\nTo encourage further stock ownership by its directors, the Bank maintains a stock matching program pursuant to\nwhich it funds the purchase of additional shares of Company common stock on behalf of a director in an amount equal to\n125% of the shares of Company common stock otherwise purchased by the director, up to an annual value of $25,000 per\ndirector.\n2023 Director Fees\nIn 2023, each non-employee member of the Board of Directors received an annual retainer of $30,000 and the\nchairman of each board committee received an additional annual retainer of $2,500, in each case payable quarterly. During\n2023, all board meetings of the Company and the Bank were joint meetings, with the Chairman of the Board receiving\n$2,000 per meeting attended and each non-employee director receiving $1,000 per meeting attended. For special meetings\nof the Company and the Bank, all non-employee directors received $1,000 per meeting attended. For all committee\nmeetings, the non-employee directors received $700 per meeting attended. Each non-employee director of the Bank and\nthe Company also receives reimbursement for any travel, food and lodging expenses. Directors who are also employees\nof the Company or the Bank received no additional compensation for their service as a director.\n145\n2023 Director Compensation(1)\nThe following table contains information concerning the compensation of the directors of the Company and the Bank\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

The error corrections required a recovery analysis under the Clawback Policy,\nwhich was effective from and after October 2, 2023, in accordance with Section 5608 of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The\nClawback Policy is filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 97. In accordance with the Nasdaq Listing\nRules, the Clawback Policy only applies to incentive compensation received on or after October 2, 2023. Accordingly,\nany incentive compensation received prior to that date is not subject to recovery under the Clawback Policy.\nThe Compensation Committee concluded that recovery of compensation was not required pursuant to the Clawback\nPolicy because none of the “incentive compensation” covered by the Clawback Policy that otherwise may have been\nimpacted by the restatement has been paid or otherwise settled to the executive officers. As described earlier in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K, the Compensation Committee used its discretion to eliminate short-term incentive payments for\nexecutive management for 2023. No amounts have been settled or otherwise paid with respect to the 2021 Performance\nUnits, 2022 Performance Units and 2023 Performance Units because their respective performance periods have not yet\n148\nconcluded. Amounts earned, if any, under the 2021 Performance Units, 2022 Performance Units and 2023 Performance\nUnits” will be paid based on appropriately restated metrics following the conclusion of the respective performance periods.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2023 Fiscal Year-End\nThe following table contains information concerning the named executive officers’ outstanding stock options, stock\nawards and stock units as of December 31, 2023.\nOption A wa r ds Stock Awar ds\nEquity Incentive Plan Awards Number of Market Value\nNumber of Number of Number of Market or Payout Shares or of Shares\nSecurities Securities Unearned Shares, Value of Unearned Units of or Units\nUnderlying Underlying Option Units, or Other Shares, Units, or Stock of Stock\nUnexercised Unexercised Exercise Option Rights That Have Other Rights That That Have That Have\nOptions (#) Options (#) Price Expiration Not Vested Have Not Vested Not Vested Not Vested\nName Exercisable Unexercisable ($) Date (#) ($) (1) (#) ($) (1)\nDennis J.

Zember, Switzer and Fulk and Ms. Gore, if the\npayments and benefits under the employment agreement, together with other payments and benefits the executive may\nhave the right to receive, on account of a change in control would exceed the maximum limit imposed on the total of such\npayments and benefits by Section 280G of the Code (without triggering the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the\nCode), the agreement provides for a comparison of two alternative scenarios for addressing Section 280G and Section 4999\nof the Code, and the application of the scenario that leaves the executive in the more favorable net after-tax position.\nSpecifically, the executive will receive whichever of the following is more favorable to him or her on a net after-tax basis:\n(i) the payments and benefits reduced to the extent necessary so that none of the payments or benefits is subject to the\nexcise tax or (ii) the full amount of the payments and benefits, which is subject to the excise tax, with the executive being\nresponsible for paying any excise tax imposed.\nRestrictive Covenants. Each employment agreement contains confidentiality provisions and covenants not to compete\nand not to solicit customers or employees that are in effect for 18 months after termination of employment.\nDefinitions. or purposes of the employment agreements:\n• the executive will generally have “good reason” to terminate his or her employment if the company\nnegatively changes certain important aspects of the executive’s employment, including reducing the\nexecutive’s authority, responsibility or salary, removes the executive from his or her position, moves the\nexecutive’s principal office a material distance, reduces the executive’s fringe benefits, fails to comply with\nany material term of the agreement, fails to require any successor to expressly assume and agree to perform\nthe obligations under the agreement, or provides written notice of non-renewal of the initial term or any\nrenewal term of the agreement; and\n• termination for “cause” generally includes the executive’s willful misconduct, misappropriation or\nembezzlement of funds or property, fraud or dishonesty, failure to perform material duties or responsibilities\nor failure to follow reasonable instructions or policies, conviction of, indictment for or entry of a guilty plea\nor plea of no contest with respect to a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, breach of a material\nterm of the agreement or material violation of applicable policies, codes and standards of behavior, willful\nviolation of any final cease-and-desist order, breach of a fiduciary duty or conduct likely to result in material\ninjury to the Company or the Bank.\n151\nTreatment of Stock Awards upon a Change in Control\nFor stock awards granted under the 2017 Plan, in the event of a “change of control” (as defined in the 2017 Plan), the\nCompensation Committee may, as to any outstanding award, either at the time an award is made or any time thereafter,\ntake any one or more of the following actions in its discretion and without the consent of the participant: (i) provide for\nacceleration of the vesting, delivery, and exercisability of, and the lapse of time-based and/or performance-based vesting\nrestrictions with respect to, any award so that such award may be exercised or realized in full on or before a date initially\nfixed by the Compensation Committee; (ii) provide for the purchase, settlement, or cancellation of any award by the\nCompany, for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been obtained upon the exercise of such award or\nrealization of a participant’s rights had such award been currently exercisable or payable; (iii) provide for the replacement\nof any stock-settled award with a cash-settled award; (iv) make such adjustment to any such award then outstanding as the\nCompensation Committee deems appropriate to reflect such change of control and to retain the economic value of the\naward; or (v) cause any award then outstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by the acquiring or\nsurviving corporation in such change of control.\nUpon the occurrence of a change in control, any unvested shares of time-based restricted stock will become vested.\nThe performance unit agreements provide that if there is a change of control prior to the last day of the performance period,\nthen (i) if the units are not assumed by the surviving entity or otherwise equitably converted or substituted in connection\nwith the change of control, then the target number of performance units will vest and convert to shares as of the date of\nthe change of control; or (ii) if the units are assumed by the surviving entity or otherwise equitably converted or substituted\nin connection with the change of control, then the target number of performance units will become fully vested if the\ngrantee resigns for good reason or is terminated without cause within two years following the change in control.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Zember’s amended and restated employment agreement provides that if he is\nterminated without cause or resigns for good reason following a change in control, then his performance units will be\ndeemed to have been earned as of his termination date based upon the actual level of achievement of all relevant\nperformance goals measured as of the date of such termination, subject to the Zember Performance Unit Amendment.\nTreatment of Awards upon Termination of Employment Without Cause, Death or Disability\nPursuant to the 2017 Plan, if the executive’s employment or service is terminated due to death or disability, any\nunvested shares of time-based restricted stock will become vested. With respect to the performance units granted in 2022\nand 2021, if the executive’s employment with the Company terminates by reason of grantee’s death or disability at any\ntime prior to the last day of the performance period, then a pro rata portion of the target award will vest and convert to\nshares of stock on the date of such termination, subject to the Zember Performance Unit Amendment in the case of Mr.\nZember. The performance unit agreements also provide that if the executive’s employment is terminated without cause at\nany time prior to the last day of the performance period, then the target number of units will vest and convert to shares on\nthe date of such termination, subject to the Zember Performance Unit Amendment in the case of Mr. Zember.\nSummary of Potential Benefits. The tables below reflect estimates of the amount of compensation that would be payable\nto the named executive officers upon a qualifying termination under the agreements and plans described above on\nDecember 31, 2023. Actual amounts that would be paid out can only be determined at the time of such qualifying\ntermination. Mr. Sheflett passed away on January 16, 2024, and his estate received life insurance payouts (two times his\nsalary plus additional insurance purchased), BOLI payouts, vesting of restricted stock and stock units, and exercise of\noptions.\n152\nTermination without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason\nHealth Value of\nCash Insurance Unvested\nSeverance Benefits Equity Awards Other Total\nName ($) ($) ($) (1) ($) ($)\nDennis J.

The pay ratio included in this information\nis a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Given the different\nmethodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio\nreported below should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.\nFor 2023, our last completed fiscal year, the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company\n(other than our CEO) was $53,934 and the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary\nCompensation Table included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, was $1,196,693. Based on this information, for 2023,\nthe ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was\n22 to 1.\nTo identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total\ncompensation of the “median employee,” the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustment and estimates that\nwe used were as follows:\n• We selected December 31, 2023 as the date upon which we would identify the “median employee.” As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had 511 employees working at the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\n• We used taxable income as reported on Form W-2 as our consistently applied compensation measure, with the\nmeasurement period being calendar year 2023.\n• We determined that the “median employee” was a full-time, salaried employee located in the United States, with\ntotal compensation for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2023 in the amount of $53,934.\n• With respect to the annual total compensation of the “median employee,” we identified and calculated the\nelements of such employee’s compensation for 2023 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of\nRegulation S-K.\n• The annual total compensation of our CEO was $1,196,693, which is the amount reported in the “Total” column\nof our 2023 Summary Compensation Table included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n154\nItem 12.

Certain Relationships, Related Transactions and Director Independence\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRelated Party Employees\nSharon C. Taylor, the daughter of Marie T. Leibson, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer of the Company\nand the Bank, is employed as a Vice President of the Bank, and received a salary, bonus and stock awards totaling\napproximately $119,193 in 2023, as well as benefits consistent with those provided to other employees with equivalent\nqualifications and responsibilities.\nChristian D. Zember, the nephew of Dennis J. Zember, Jr, Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, is\nemployed as a small business banker of the Bank, and received a salary totaling approximately $81,439 in 2023, as well\nas benefits consistent with those provided to other employees with equivalent qualifications and responsibilities.\nRelationships in the Ordinary Course\nMany of the directors and executive officers of the Company and the Bank and their associates, which include\ncorporations, partnerships and other organizations in which they are officers or partners or in which they and their\nimmediate families have at least a 5% interest, are customers of the Bank. Loans to directors and executive officers and\ncertain significant stockholders of the Company and the Bank are subject to limitations contained in the Federal Reserve\nAct, the principal effect of which is to require that extensions of credit by the Bank to executive officers, directors and\ncertain significant stockholders of the Company and the Bank satisfy the following standards: the loans (i) are made in the\nordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at\nthe time for comparable transactions with persons unaffiliated with the Company and (ii) do not involve more than the\nnormal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. As of December 31, 2023, there were 37 such loans\noutstanding totaling $25.1 million in the aggregate. The Company expects the Bank to have such transactions or\ntransactions on a similar basis with the directors, executive officers and certain significant stockholders of the Company\nand the Bank and their associates in the future.\nPolicy Concerning Related Party Transactions\nPursuant to the Company’s policy, the Board of Directors is required to review all related party transactions for\npotential conflicts of interest. For purposes of this policy, a “related person transaction” generally means a transaction\nwhere the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. A\n“related person” under the policy generally means (1) a director, director nominee or executive officer of the Company;\n(2) a person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of our common stock; and\n(3) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, which means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent,\nspouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law of the director,\nexecutive officer, nominee, or more than five percent beneficial owner, and any person (other than a tenant or employee)\nsharing the household of such director, executive officer, nominee, or more than five percent beneficial owner. Under the\npolicy, any related party transaction may be consummated or may continue only (1) if the Board approves or ratifies such\ntransaction and if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arms’-length dealings with an\nunrelated third party, (2) if the transaction involves compensation that has been approved by the Company’s Compensation\nCommittee or (3) if the transaction has been approved by the disinterested members of the Board of Directors. The Board\nmay approve or ratify the related party transaction only if the Board determines that, under all of the circumstances, the\ntransaction is in the best interests of the Company.\nDIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nDuring the review by the Company’s Board of Directors of director independence, the Board considered transactions\nand relationships between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its\nsubsidiaries and affiliates, including those reported under “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” below.\nThe Board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between directors or any member of their\n157\nimmediate family (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner\nor significant equity holder) and members of the Company’s senior management or their affiliates. The purpose of this\nreview was to determine whether any such relationships or transactions existed that were inconsistent with a determination\nthat the director is independent.\nAs a result of this review, the Board affirmatively determined that all of the Company’s current directors, with the\nexception of Dennis J. Zember, Jr., are independent directors as defined by the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock\nMarket. Mr. Zember is considered to be an “inside” director because of his employment as a senior executive of the\nCompany. The independent directors of the Company hold executive sessions from time to time without the Chief\nExecutive Officer or any other member of management present.\nItem 14.
