HELIER, Jersey--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Metals Acquisition Limited ARBN 671 963 198 (NYSE: MTAL; ASX: MAC) \n\nIn accordance with ASX Listing Rule 3.13.3, please see attached the Chair address to be delivered by Patrice Merrin, Chair and the CEO presentation to be delivered by Mick McMullen, Chief Executive Officer and Director at the Metals Acquisition Limited ARBN 671 963 198 (NYSE: MTAL; ASX: MAC), a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands 2024 Annual General Meeting to be held at 5:00pm (New York time) today and 9.00am (Sydney time) November 22, 2024. \n\nThis announcement is authorised for release by Chris Rosario and Trevor Hart, Joint Company Secretaries. \n\n**About Metals Acquisition Limited**\n\nMetals Acquisition Limited (NYSE: MTAL; ASX:MAC) is a company focused on operating and acquiring metals and mining businesses in high quality, stable jurisdictions that are critical in the electrification and decarbonization of the global economy. \n\n** Chair Address - Patrice Merrin **\n\nOn behalf of the Metals Acquisition Limited Board and our dedicated management team I would like to welcome you to the 2024 Annual General Meeting of Metals Acquisition Limited ( **MAC** or **Company** ). \n\nAs we reflect on the significant developments at MAC since we acquired the CSA Copper Mine in June 2023, I am filled with pride and optimism for our journey ahead. Our teams, both at site and in corporate, have worked tirelessly to reinvigorate the asset. \n\nThe safety of our teams remains our highest priority. Our efforts in this regard have been unwavering, allowing us to navigate challenges while protecting the wellbeing of our workforce. We will continue to prioritise the safety of our people. \n\n2024 has been an exceptional year for MAC, our focus this year was to simplify our capital structure and deleverage our balance sheet; deliver strong production and operational improvements; and continue building shareholder value. \n\nWe advanced this milestone by successfully listing on the ASX and raising A$325 million. This achievement underscores the confidence our new shareholders have in our vision and strategy. The market shares this same view as we continued to establish global visibility through the inclusion in the Russell 3000 Index, the S&P/ASX 300 Index and more recently the MSCI Global Small Miners index. \n\nFurthermore, in early May, we successfully executed the redemption of warrants, and in October we completed a A$150 million equity raise. With these additional resources, we have optimized our balance sheet and are well-equipped to explore both organic and inorganic growth opportunities, solidifying MACs position in the mining sector. \n\nOur strategic investment with Polymetals Resources Limited exemplifies our commitment to collaboration within the Cobar Basin. The CSA Copper Mine appears to host high grade zinc mineralisation near surface and adjacent to existing development. This partnership is a logical way of securing a processing option for any zinc ore we might mine without distracting our operations from the core business of mining and recovering copper. \n\nAs we look ahead, our commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) stewardship remains steadfast. We recognize the responsibility we bear in ensuring the sustainable and responsible development of mineral resources, operating safely in collaboration with local communities. We look forward to publishing our inaugural sustainability report in Q1 2025. \n\nDuring the year we strengthened our team and welcomed Leanne Heywood, Anne Templeman-Jones and Mohit Rungta to our Board of Directors and Morne Engelbrecht as our CFO. Their experience and dedication will be instrumental as we navigate the complexities of our business landscape. \n\nAs we look ahead, we are committed to becoming a +50 ktpa copper producer by 2026. Our growth projects, including the expansion of the mine to incorporate QTS South Upper and the Ventilation project, are key to achieving this goal. \n\nOur disciplined M&A strategy continues to guide us as we evaluate prospects that will allow us to acquire and operate assets in stable mining jurisdictions. These initiatives are essential for maximizing value and achieving our long-term goal of becoming a leading player in the electrification and decarbonization of the global economy. \n\nWe are excited about the future of MAC as we continue to refine our operational strategies and expand our resource base. \n\nIn closing, I would like to express my gratitude to our dedicated team for their exceptional efforts and to all our shareholders for your continued support. Together, we are well-positioned to achieve our goals and drive shareholder value. \n\n** CEO Address – Mick McMullen **\n\nGood morning/evening everyone, and welcome to Metals Acquisition Limited’s ( **MAC** or **Company** ) Annual General Meeting for 2024. It’s a pleasure to address our shareholders, board members, and valued employees who continue to contribute to MAC’s success in the global copper mining sector. \n\nSince our acquisition of the CSA mine in June 2023 we have been working tirelessly to optimise operations and the Company is proud of what we have achieved. \n\nSince acquiring CSA we have paid down around US$168 million in interest-bearing liabilities, underscoring our commitment to financial discipline and a stronger balance sheet. In the third quarter of 2024, we achieved a copper production of 10,159 tonnes with an impressive grade of 4%, putting us firmly on track to reach our full-year guidance range of 38-43kt. Our efforts have also positioned us with a clear pathway toward producing over 50kt of copper annually within the next two years. \n\nThis ongoing performance, combined with strategic de-leveraging, places MAC in a position of resilience and strength. \n\nOur commitment to cost efficiency is evident, with Q3 C1 cash costs at US$1.90 per pound, representing a 6% reduction from Q2. This reflects both our efforts to control operational costs and the benefits of our recent improvements at the CSA site. \n\nAs of the end of Q3, MAC held approximately US$81 million in cash, with an additional US$25 million undrawn revolving facility, creating a pro-forma liquidity of around US$226 million. This financial flexibility empowers us to pursue strategic opportunities that align with our long-term growth plans. \n\nOur efforts in exploration have continued to yield promising results, with recent drilling confirming high-grade copper targets. We invested US$2.1 million in exploration during Q3 alone, and our drilling projects have upgraded both inferred and mineralized material, expanding our resources and reserves at CSA. This continued resource growth solidifies our long-life copper exposure, with significant reserve increases achieved in 2024. \n\nTo support our production targets, we launched several capital projects, including a ventilation project that will enhance CSA’s production capacity to over 50kt annually. These projects are not only critical for our production but also reinforce our commitment to safe and sustainable operations. \n\nSafety and sustainability are at the core of MAC’s operations. Following an increase in Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate in Q2, we implemented additional proactive measures and are pleased to report a slight reduction in Q3. This includes strengthened field leadership and enhanced safety inspections to ensure a safe work environment across all levels of the operation. \n\nOn the environmental front, I’m proud to report that our annual return to the Environmental Protection Authority had no reportable incidents, pollution events, or license breaches. We’re exploring further options to optimize and reduce the environmental impact of our Tailings Storage Facilities as we continue our responsible mining approach. \n\nLooking ahead, MAC’s strategic priorities remain focused on operational excellence, growth, and value creation for shareholders. We are on track to reach a production rate exceeding 50kt per year by 2026, with the continued strength of our balance sheet and liquidity enabling us to consider further M&A activities that fit our operational expertise and are located in stable, high-quality jurisdictions. \n\nIn conclusion, 2024 has been a year of progress and achievement. \n\nMAC is well-positioned to continue delivering value to our shareholders while advancing our operational and sustainability goals. I am confident in our pathway to growth, our financial resilience, and our commitment to responsible and efficient copper production. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241121970569r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nMick McMullen Chief Executive Officer & Director Metals Acquisition Limited investors@metalsacqcorp.com\n\nMorne Engelbrecht Chief Financial Officer Metals Acquisition Limited \n\nSource: Metals Acquisition Limited\n\n[View All News](https://www.metalsacquisition.com/newsroom/news/default.aspx)\n"

HELIER, Jersey--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Metals Acquisition Limited (NYSE: MTAL) (ASX:MAC):\n\nMetals Acquisition Limited (“MAC” or the “Company”) today provides a market update on the continuing exploration and resource development at the CSA Copper Mine: \n\n**Highlights**\n\n  * All results reported in this release are after the cut-off date (August 31, 2023) for the 2023 Resource and Reserve and will be incorporated in the 2024 Resource and Reserve Estimate update. \n  * Results from QTS North (“QTSN”) include: \n    * 12.5m @ 5.4% Cu from 103.0m and 19.8m @ 10.9% Cu from 177.1m in UDD23021 \n    * 27.3m @ 8.7% Cu from 126.0m in UDD23019 \n    * 8.1m @ 7.3% Cu from 143.6m, 4.9m @ 10.9% Cu from 168.8m, 4.3m @ 8.3% Cu from 177.3m and 13.3m @ 9.2% Cu from 183.7m in UDDD24063 \n  * Results from QTS Central (“QTSC”) include: \n    * 23.6m @ 5.2% Cu from 98.7 m in UDD24017 \n    * 6.3m @ 11.3% Cu from 84.0m in UDD24012 \n    * 6.6m @ 8.4% Cu from 54.3m in UDD24010 \n  * Results for QTSS Upper A include: \n    * 3.8m @ 17.1% Cu from 214.3m in QSDD061 \n\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\nUnderground exploration continued to focus on the down dip and along strike extensions of the QTSN and QTSC deposits, as well as the shallower, up dip portions of the East and West deposits and QTSS Upper. \n\nResults are reported as down hole widths. A complete list of September quarter 2024 resource drilling results is contained in Table 1 at the end of this report. \n\nMAC CEO, Mick McMullen commented, _“The CSA deposits continue to deliver the high-grade intervals we have come to expect from it. The drilling of the Inferred and mineralised extensions of QTSN have shown good continuity with strike extensions adding to the tonnes per vertical metre of the mineralisation. Having a core deposit that grades in excess of 8% Cu provides us with a lot of flexibility all through the cycle. As we continue to refine mining methods and manage dilution better than in the past, we are seeing the benefit in the mill with the September quarter mill feed grade at 4% Cu._\n\n_QTSSU-A has been drilled from surface now to provide us the confidence to commence development works in the near term. In addition, we see good potential for additional discovery between this deposit and the main mine with over 600m of poorly tested strike extension in this area that the development will pass through. Our intention is to push the development past QTSSU-A to the Pink Panther prospect that is located 250m further to the South East along strike to provide both a drill platform and potential access for development if that prospect can be converted to a resource._\n\n_Finally, drilling of the high-grade Zn mineralisation above the East and West lenses has confirmed the presence as indicated by historical data and as Polymetals (“POL”) advance their planning for restart of the Endeavour mill this should dovetail well with our timing for potentially mining this material.”_\n\n**CSA Copper Mine**\n\nThe CSA Copper Mine is a world class mine that consists of a series of mineralized lenses that extend from surface to a depth of over 2.3km. The main deposits are QTSN, QTSC, QTSS, Eastern and Western lenses with additional mineralisation in the near surface QTSS Upper A zone. Approximately 75% of the resources are contained in QTSN. \n\nRefer to Figure 1 below for the location of the various deposits.\n\n![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-1-exploration.JPG)\n\n**Exploration Results**\n\nDrilling has been targeting conversion of Inferred resource to Measured and Indicated for inclusion in the Reserve Estimate, as well as the known mineralized lenses to add incremental resources. \n\nThe location of the significant drill results is shown in Figure 2 below.\n\n**Figure 2 - QTSN and QTSC Long Section**\n\n**![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-2-exploration.JPG)**\n\nAt QTSN, the most recent drilling continues to confirm the location of the Inferred Resource and will enable it to be upgraded as well as confirmation of the smaller mineralized lenses adjacent to the existing resource. This can be seen in Figures 3 to 4. QTSN is characterised by a series of high-grade lenses (grading plus 5% Cu) that can range in width from 10-35m surrounded by a lower grade halo on the footwall. \n\nAs drilling has progressed down dip it would appear that tonnes per vertical metre are increasing and drilling is now pushed down well into the Inferred resources (refer to Fig 3 & Fig 3A) which will be helpful for upgrading of that material.\n\n**Figure 3 – QTSN Cross Section (4015mN)**\n\n**![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-3-exploration.JPG)**\n\n**Figure 3A – QTSN Cross Section (3665mN)**\n\n**![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-3A-exploration.JPG)**\n\nThe 13.3m @ 9.2% Cu in UDD24063 is completely outside any of the current resource of known mineralisation and has significantly extended the strike length of QTSN to the south and is a high priority area for follow up infill drilling. \n\nQTSC is located adjacent to QTSN and is centred around a depth of 1.4km and is open both up and down dip. QTSC is typically narrower than QTSN but higher grade. As seen in Figures 4 and 5 the most recent drilling continues to confirm the presence of the high-grade mineralisation below the current working level through the Inferred Resource and into mineralised material that will both extend the resource beyond its current limits and extend the Measured and Indicated material for inclusion into the 2024 Mineral Reserve. \n\nThe interval in UDD24017 is substantially thicker than typically seen at QTSC and in the middle of the Inferred resource which should have a materially positive impact for classification of this resource.\n\n**Figure 4 – QTSC Cross Section**\n\n**![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-4-exploration.JPG)**\n\nThe shallow (< 400m from surface) portions of the CSA Copper Mine include substantial mineralisation around the existing workings that are the up-dip portion of the Eastern and Western lenses as seen in Figure 5. This material is at approximately the same elevation as the QTSS Upper deposit located approximately 600m to the south of the main mine as seen in Figure 5 also.\n\n**Figure 5 – QTSS Upper A and Eastern Long section**\n\n**![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-5-exploration.JPG)**\n\nDrilling in the Pb- Zn areas over the Eastern lens has intersected high grade Zn mineralisation plus Pb and Cu immediately adjacent to existing development. MACs focus is on the Cu mineralisation within the rest of the mine, however with the agreement signed with Polymetals in the June quarter MAC now has access to Zn material processing capacity. Results returned during the quarter (refer Fig 6) from Upper Pb-Zn Eastern and Western Lenses (“Pb-Zn”) include: \n\n  * 1.7m @ 3.3% Zn, 1.5% Pb, 0.1% Cu & 7g/t Ag from 176.8m (EWDD24003) \n  * 5.8m @ 8.3% Zn, 3.9% Pb, 0.2% Cu & 11g/t Ag from 190.2m (EWDD24003) \n  * 5.7m @ 3.5% Zn, 0.87% Pb, 0.7% Cu & 19g/t Ag from 219m (EWDD24003) \n\n\n\n**Figure 6 – Eastern Lens Cross Section**\n\n**![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-6-exploration.JPG)**\n\nQTSS Upper A is a narrow (1.5 to 4m) but very high-grade zone of mineralisation that is much shallower than the rest of the mine. This lens starts approximately 120m below surface and extends to approximately 350m below surface.\n\nAs the majority of the mineral resource for QTSS Upper is in the Inferred category, this material is being drilling out from surface to upgrade the classification for detailed mine planning. The production guidance that MAC has published does not include any Inferred material, and as such, any production from QTSS Upper would be in excess of the production guidance. \n\nFigure 7 illustrates the recent Cu and Zn results from this deposit which are typically narrow but very high grade and close to surface.\n\n**Figure 7 –QTSS Upper Cross Section**\n\n**![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-7-exploration.JPG)**\n\n**Figure 8 –QTSS Upper Cross Section - Zn mineralisation**\n\n**![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Exploration/2024-10-21-Figure-8-exploration.JPG)**\n\n**Qualified Person Statement**\n\nThe information in this announcement that relates to Exploration Results at the CSA Copper Mine is based on information compiled or reviewed by Eliseo Apaza, a Qualified Person for the purpose of S-K 1300 who is a Member of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Mr Apaza is employed by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Apaza has given (and not withdrawn) written consent to the inclusion in the report of the results reported here and the form and context in which it appears. \n\nThis announcement is authorised for release by Mick McMullen, Chief Executive Officer and Director. \n\n**About Metals Acquisition Limited**\n\nMetals Acquisition Limited (NYSE: MTAL; ASX:MAC) is a company focused on operating and acquiring metals and mining businesses in high quality, stable jurisdictions that are critical in the electrification and decarbonization of the global economy. \n\n**Cautionary and Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis release has been prepared by Metals Acquisition Limited (“Company” or “MAC”) and includes “forward-looking statements.” The forward-looking information is based on the Company’s expectations, estimates, projections and opinions of management made in light of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that management of the Company believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which may prove to be incorrect. Assumptions have been made by the Company regarding, among other things: the price of copper, continuing commercial production at the CSA Copper Mine without any major disruption, the receipt of required governmental approvals, the accuracy of capital and operating cost estimates, the ability of the Company to operate in a safe, efficient and effective manner and the ability of the Company to obtain financing as and when required and on reasonable terms. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which may have been used by the Company. Although management believes that the assumptions made by the Company and the expectations represented by such information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. \n\nMAC’s actual results may differ from expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward- looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, MAC’s expectations with respect to future performance of the CSA Copper Mine. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside MAC’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the supply and demand for copper; the future price of copper; the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures and requirements for additional capital; cash flow provided by operating activities; unanticipated reclamation expenses; claims and limitations on insurance coverage; the uncertainty in Mineral Resource estimates; the uncertainty in geological, metallurgical and geotechnical studies and opinions; infrastructure risks;; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in MAC’s other filings with the SEC and the ASX. MAC cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. MAC cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. MAC does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based. \n\nMore information on potential factors that could affect MAC’s or CSA Copper Mine’s financial results is included from time to time in MAC’s public reports filed with the SEC and the ASX. If any of these risks materialize or MAC’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that MAC does not presently know, or that MAC currently believes are immaterial, that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect MAC’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. MAC anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. However, while MAC may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, MAC specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing MAC’s assessment as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. \n\n**JORC / SK-1300**\n\nMAC is subject to the reporting requirements of both the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (US) and applicable Australian securities laws (including the ASX Listing Rules), and as a result, has separately reported its Exploration Results according to the standards applicable to those requirements. U.S. reporting requirements are governed by S-K 1300, as issued by the SEC. Australian reporting requirements are governed by Australasian Joint Ore Reserve Committee Code, 2012 edition (JORC). Both sets of reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of consistency and confidence in the disclosures being reported, but the standards embody slightly different approaches and definitions. All disclosure of Exploration Results in this report are reported in accordance with S-K 1300. For JORC and ASX Listing Rule compliant disclosure (including JORC Table 1 analysis) please see the Company’s separate release to be released on ASX on 22 October 2024. \n\n**Table 1 – Significant Drill Results for QTSN, QTSC, QTSSU-A & Eastern Systems**\n\n**Cu Results**\n\n**Hole** |  **East (MG)** |  **North (MG)** |  **RL.

HELIER, Jersey--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Metals Acquisition Limited (NYSE: MTAL; ASX:MAC)\n\nMetals Acquisition Limited ARBN 671 963 198 (NYSE: MTAL; ASX: MAC), a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands (“ **MAC** ” or the “ **Company** ”) is pleased to release its September 2024 quarterly activities report (“ **Q3 2024** ” or “ **September quarter** ”). \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**TRIFR of 14.2** a slight decrease in TRIFR quarter on quarter with further remediation strategies implemented. \n\n**Strong and consistent quarterly copper production with lower cash cost**\n\n  * Copper production of 10,159 tonnes at the CSA Copper Mine (“ **CSA** ” or “ **CSA Mine** ”) is the second strongest copper production under MAC’s ownership following on from the record June quarter \n  * Copper production for 2024 tracking to mid-point of annual guidance at 40,500 tonnes of copper \n  * Double lift stope strategy implemented in the June quarter driving high grade consistent copper production, delivering 21,023 tonnes of copper production for the June and September quarters at an average grade of 4.1% Cu from the benefit of lower dilution than reserve assumptions \n  * Q4 2024 mine plan targeting another record December quarterly copper production \n  * C1 of US$1.90/lb 1 improved by ~6% compared to the June quarter, driven by a reduction in milling costs, treatment and refining charges and an increase in development costs capitalised \n\n\n\n**Key copper growth projects expected to drive 25% increase in annual production by 2026**\n\n  * MAC aiming to be a +50ktpa Copper producer by 2026 \n  * Ventilation project – work well underway on development drives to first major raise bore ventilation locations with procurement strategies advancing and completion targeted by mid-2026 \n  * QTS South Upper – procurement of equipment and manning requirements commenced with planning taking place to start development in Q4 2024 and ore mining expected to commence from Q3 2025 \n  * Polymetals (“ **POL** ”) announced that it secured financing to fund its mine restart in H1 2025 – the value of MAC’s investment in POL has increased by ~21% since its initial investment. MAC has the right to invest a further A$2.5 million at A$35c a share when POL is fully funded for restart of operations \n\n\n\n**Generating material operational free cash flow**\n\n  * Operational free cash flow of ~US$30 million 2 for the quarter with an average realised copper sales price of US$4.18/lb 3 (Q3 2024 Copper spot average at US$4.17/lb) \n  * Cash and cash equivalents of ~US$81 million after repayment of ~US$8 million in senior debt principal and US$2.1 million of exploration and expenditure \n  * MAC also had ~US$9.0 million of receivable outstanding Quotational Period receipts, ~US$6.4 million of unsold concentrate and a strategic investment in POL valued at ~A$2.9 4 million as at 30 September 2024 \n\n\n\n**A$150 million (~US$103 million) equity raise completed subsequent to quarter end**\n\n  * Raised gross proceeds of ~A$150 million (~US$103 million) 5 at an issue price of A$18.00 per New CDI \n  * Placement was well supported with support from new and existing institutional and sophisticated investors \n  * Proceeds will enable MAC to retire the high-cost Mezzanine debt facility while also providing additional flexibility to pursue strategic inorganic growth opportunities \n  * Pro-forma liquidity as at 30 September 2024 of ~US$226 million 6\n\n\n\n**ESG**\n\n**Safety**\n\nThe TRIFR for the CSA Copper Mine decreased from an average of 14.4 in Q2 2024 to 14.2 in Q3 2024. This is below the NSW underground metalliferous TRIFR average for 2022 of 15.5. Although a decrease quarter on quarter, Q3 2024 has not been favourable for safety performance with one LTI recorded for the period. Plans have been initiated in the prior quarter to remediate the increase in TRIFR as compared to 2023 via increased awareness with extensive training and coaching, as well as increased safety presence on site. Increased leadership field safety interactions have been a core focus of Q3 2024. \n\n**_Figure 1 - CSA Copper Mine Recordable Injuries by Quarter_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-1.jpg)_**\n\n**Regulatory**\n\nThe CSA Mine Rehabilitation Objectives Statement, Final Landform and Rehabilitation Plan, the Annual Rehabilitation Report and the CSA Mine Forward Program have all been approved by the NSW Resources Regulator. Planning for the CSA Annual Plan is underway and due for submission by April 2025. \n\nThe Environment Protection Authority annual return was submitted during the quarter with no reportable incidents, pollution events, or licence breaches recorded during the reporting period, demonstrating our clear commitment to managing environmental performance, and an owner operator mentality in a small community setting. \n\n**Production and cost summary**\n\n**_Table 1 – Production and cost summary (unaudited)_ **\n\n**Units** |  **Q4 2023** |  **Q1 2024** |  **Q2 2024** |  **Q3 2024** |  **QoQ Change (%)**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Copper Production** |  **Tonnes** |  9,832  |  8,786  |  10,864  |  10,159  |  (6.5%)   \n**Sustaining capital** |  **US$ million** |  $10.0  |  $13.0  |  $12.8  |  $12.5  |  (2.0%)   \n**Cash cost (C1) 7 ** |  **US$/lb** |  $1.99  |  $2.15  |  $2.02 8 |  $1.90  |  (6.1%)   \n**Total cash cost 9 ** |  **US$/lb** |  $2.73  |  $3.17  |  $2.72  |  $2.71  |  (0.4%)   \n**Group Net Debt 10 ** |  **US$ million** |  $260  |  $253  |  $232  |  $232  |  0%   \n  \n**Metals Acquisition Limited’s CEO, Mick McMullen, said:**\n\n_“Following a record June quarter, our CSA Copper Mine operational team delivered another strong and consistent September quarter in line with our mine plan, reaching copper production of 10,159 tonnes, while improving safety performance. This marks another milestone as we produced 21,023 tonnes of copper for the last two quarters. Based on the reserve plan, we expect copper production to increase over the remaining quarter of the year._\n\n_Higher grade stopes at the CSA Copper Mine continue to form a large proportion of our annual production and played a key role again during the quarter, with milled copper grade achieved of 4.0%._\n\n_MAC successfully completed an equity raise, totalling approximately A$150 million or approximately US$103 million of gross proceeds. The oversubscribed placement was supported by the new and existing institutional and sophisticated investors both in Australia and offshore. This broad support is a testament to the high-quality nature of the CSA Copper Mine and the significant work that has been undertaken by management to deliver on a range of operational improvements over the past year._\n\n_Proceeds of the Placement, together with existing cash, will enable MAC to optimise its balance sheet, while also providing additional flexibility to pursue strategic inorganic growth opportunities. We thank all shareholders for their continued support._\n\n_We have also commenced two key capital projects to grow our copper production by a further 25% by 2026 to over 50,000 tonnes of copper production per annum; our growth projects include the expansion of the mine to include QTS South Upper and the Ventilation project, which are brought online Q3 2025 and mid-2026 respectively._\n\n_Finally, we are proposing a special resolution at the AGM to change the company name to MAC Copper Limited. The change of the company name better reflects the business activities of the Company as we continue toward being the next high quality copper miner of scale.”_\n\n**Operations**\n\n**_Table 2 - Quarterly Operational Performance of the CSA Copper Mine_ _(unaudited)_ **\n\nCSA Copper Mine Metrics  (unaudited)  |  Units  |  Q4 2023  |  Q1 2024  |  Q2 2024  |  Q3 2024  |  QoQ % variance   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nU/g development - Capital  |  Metres  |  841  |  466  |  449  |  735  |  64%   \nU/g development - Operating  |  Metres  |  448  |  703  |  611  |  359  |  (41%)   \nRehab  |  Metres  |  153  |  246  |  113  |  145  |  28%   \nTotal development  |  Metres  |  1,441  |  1,415  |  1,173  |  1,239  |  6%   \nOre Mined  |  Tonnes  |  268,685  |  256,031  |  271,469  |  238,937  |  (12%)   \nTonnes Milled  |  Tonnes  |  266,105  |  260,297  |  266,936  |  260,953  |  (2%)   \nCopper grade processed  |  %  |  3.8%  |  3.5%  |  4.2%  |  4.0%  |  (5%)   \nCopper Recovery  |  %  |  97.6%  |  97.6%  |  97.9%  |  97.2%  |  (1%)   \n**Copper Produced** |  **Tonnes** |  **9,832** |  **8,786** |  **10,864** |  **10,159** |  **(6%)**  \nSilver Produced  |  Ounces  |  114,969  |  102,182  |  134,072  |  112,299  |  (16%)   \n**Copper Sold** |  **Tonnes** |  **8,819** |  **8,112** |  **12,984** |  **10,244** |  **(21%)**  \n**Achieved Copper price 11 ** |  **US$/lb** |  **3.85** |  **3.87** |  **4.41** |  **4.18** |  (12%)   \nMining Cost  |  US$/t Mined  |  $75.5  |  $95.7  |  $91.9  |  $85.9  |  (7%)   \nProcessing Cost  |  US$/t Milled  |  $25.5  |  $25.7  |  $31.9  |  $26.3  |  (18%)   \nG+A Cost  |  US$/t Milled  |  $29.6  |  $33.1  |  $25.6  |  $27.5  |  7%   \n**Total Operating Cost** |  **US$/t milled** |  **$130.6** |  **$154.6** |  **$149.3** |  **$139.6** |  **(6%)**  \nDevelopment Cost  |  US$/metre  |  $9,667  |  $15,478  |  $9,330  |  $12,825  |  37%   \nCapital Expenditure 12 |  US$ million  |  $10.0  |  $13.0  |  $12.8  |  $12.5  |  (2%)   \nTonnes Milled per employee  |  t/employee  |  189  |  184  |  186  |  174  |  (6%)   \nMining  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.94  |  1.27  |  1.04  |  0.92  |  (12%)   \nProcessing  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.31  |  0.35  |  0.36  |  0.31  |  (14%)   \nGeneral and Admin  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.36  |  0.44  |  0.28  |  0.32  |  12%   \nTreatment and refining  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.36  |  0.17  |  0.26  |  0.23  |  (11%)   \nWork in Progress inventory  |  US$/lb prod  |  (0.01)  |  (0.14)  |  0.03  |  0.02  |  (34%)   \nFreight and other costs  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.17  |  0.17  |  0.21  |  0.24  |  18%   \nSilver Credits  |  US$/lb prod  |  (0.14)  |  (0.10)  |  (0.16)  |  (0.14)  |  (12%)   \n**C1 Cash Cost** |  **US$/lb prod** |  **1.99** |  **2.15** |  **2.02 13 ** |  **1.90** |  (6%)   \nLeases  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.07  |  0.08  |  0.07  |  0.07  |  8%   \nInventory WIP  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.01  |  0.14  |  (0.03)  |  (0.02)  |  (34%)   \nRoyalties  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.20  |  0.13  |  0.13  |  0.20  |  52%   \nSustaining capital  |  US$/lb prod  |  0.46  |  0.67  |  0.53  |  0.56  |  5%   \n**Total Cash Cost** |  **US$/lb prod** |  **2.73** |  **3.17** |  **2.72** |  **2.71** |  0%   \n**Total Revenue** |  **US$ millions** |  **88.3** |  **66.0** |  **120.0** |  **87.5** |  **(27%)**  \n  \n_Unless stated otherwise all references to dollar or $ are in USD._\n\nThe September quarter demonstrated consistent mining processes that delivered above 10kt of copper production for two consecutive quarters. Production further benefited from a grade of 4.0% for the quarter with August copper grade recorded at 4.36%. The grade achieved continues to demonstrate the high-quality ore body present at CSA mine. \n\nThe double lift extraction sequence was again successfully deployed during Q3 2024 after being implemented in the previous quarter, resulting in less mining dilution achieved with stronger grades and less total ore tonnes for the same metal. \n\n**_Figure 2 - CSA Copper Mine Quarterly Copper Production (tonnes)_**\n\n**_![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-2.JPG)_**\n\nThe average received copper price before hedge settlements was lower when comparing to the prior period with the June quarter at US$4.18/lb, down ~5% compared to US$4.41/lb for the June quarter, with the average spot copper price over the September quarter at ~US$4.17/lb 14 . \n\nIn addition, the Australian dollar exchange rate was broadly flat compared to the prior quarter. \n\nC1 cash costs decreased by ~6% quarter on quarter from US$2.02/lb 15 in the June quarter to US$1.90/lb for September quarter. The drivers of the lower C1 is a combination of a reduction in milling costs, treatment and refining charges and an increase in development costs capitalised which had a positive impact of approximately US$0.24/lb offset by lower production tonnes, which negatively impacted the C1 by US$0.12/lb. \n\n**_Figure 3 - CSA Copper Mine C1 Cash Costs_ _ 16 _ _- US$/lb produced_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-3.JPG)_**\n\nMAC management continues to implement additional productivity measures to further reduce C1 costs as is evident in the declining C1 that has been achieved since the June 2024 quarter depicted above. \n\nQ2 2024 adjusted post finalisation of half year accounts with additional freight and TCRCs included accrued for recognition of June quarter pre-sales. Directionally we expect that copper TCRCs for 2025 will settle at materially lower levels than for 2024 and MAC will benefit from this from January 2025 onwards. \n\nFigure 4 provides an illustration of tonnes milled per employee which remains relatively stable quarter on quarter. \n\n**_Figure 4 - CSA Mine Tonnes Milled per Employee_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-4.JPG)_**\n\n**_Figure 5 - CSA Mine Mining Unit Rate US$/t_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-5.JPG)_**\n\nApart from copper production, the largest driver of C1 costs is the mining unit rate as mining accounts for approximately 60% of total site operating costs. \n\nMining unit rates are trending down with better cost control initiatives implemented. September 2024 mining rates decreased further with additional capital development metres achieved (64% increase as seen in Figure 7), resulting in increased mining development costs being capitalised in Q3 2024. Additional capital metres have been completed in the quarter with a focus on the North decline and both the return and fresh air drives. \n\n**_Figure 6 - CSA Mining Development Costs US$/metre_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-6.JPG)_**\n\n**_Figure 7 - CSA Copper Mine Capital Development metres_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-7.JPG)_**\n\nProcessing costs per tonne milled decreased in the September 2024 quarter after the June 2024 quarter was negatively impacted by the plant shutdown in April 2024. Tonnes processed for the September 2024 quarter were 261kt at a copper recovery rate of 97.2%. \n\nG&A unit rates increased slightly during the current quarter after the June 2024 quarter included a once-off re-allocation of stock consumables to mining and processing previously allocated to G&A, reducing the G&A unit rate. \n\n**_Figure 8 - CSA Copper Mine Processing_ ** _**Unit Rate** _ **_US$/t_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-8.JPG)_**\n\n**_Figure 9 - CSA Copper Mine Site G+A_ _Unit Rate US$/t_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-9.JPG)_**\n\nAs seen in Figure 10, capital spend (including capitalized development) decreased slightly over the quarter, largely driven by diamond drilling and vent expansion drilling. MAC continues to spend capital in accordance with its previous guidance of approximately US$52 million for FY 2024. \n\n**_Figure 10 - CSA Copper Mine Site Capital US$m_**\n\n** _![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-10.JPG)_**\n\n**MAC raises ~A$150 million (~US$103 million) through successful placement**\n\nAs announced on 9 October 2024, MAC raised approximately A$150 million (approximately US$103 million) (before costs) at an issue price of A$18.00 per New CDI. \n\nThe placement was well supported with support from new and existing institutional and sophisticated investors both in Australia and offshore, which is testament to the high-quality nature of the CSA Copper Mine and the significant work that has been undertaken by management to deliver on a range of operational improvements over the past year. \n\nProceeds of the Placement, together with existing cash, will enable MAC to optimise its balance sheet and de-lever following the acquisition of the CSA Copper Mine from Glencore plc in mid-2023, while also providing additional flexibility to pursue strategic inorganic growth opportunities. \n\n**Cash position, liquidity and debt facilities**\n\nThe Company’s unaudited cash holding at the end of Q3 2024 was ~US$81 million for an unaudited net debt 17 position of ~US$232 million. Post the equity raise noted above, the pro-forma net debt as at 30 September 2024 amounted to ~US131 million, which represents a pro-forma net gearing of 16%. \n\nThe reduction in the underlying cash position (before the equity raise) at quarter end is largely driven by the reduced pre-sales in the September quarter of ~US$13 million as compared to the June quarter of ~US$37 million resulting from a timing difference in cash receipts in the September quarter. Copper tonnes sold in Q3 2024 reduced by 2,741 as a result of the additional pre-sales in June. \n\nThe unaudited cash position also reflects outgoings of ~US$8.1 million repaid on the Senior Debt Facility at the end of the quarter, ~US$8.9 million in interest payments for the Senior debt (US$3.9 million) and Mezzanine facility (US$5.0 million) and ~US$4.6 million in Silver and Copper stream payments. \n\nAs of 30 September 2024, the pro-forma liquidity was ~US$226 million which includes cash of ~US$81 million, US$25 million undrawn revolving facility, ~US$103 million equity raised subsequent to quarter-end, ~US$17 million of outstanding Quotational Period receipts, unsold concentrate and the strategic investment held in POL at valuation of ~A$2.9 18 million. \n\n**_Figure 11 – Q3 2024 Cash flow waterfall (US$M)_**\n\n**_![](//s202.q4cdn.com/908723817/files/doc_news/2024/Q3/2024-10-21-Figure-11.JPG)_**\n\n**Exploration**\n\nDuring the September quarter, US$2.1 million was invested in exploration. \n\nInvestors are directed to the separate September quarterly exploration update released dated 21 October 2024 for the detailed results. \n\n**Three Year Production Guidance**\n\nThe copper production guidance provided to the market covering 2024, 2025 and 2026 remains unchanged: \n\n**_Table 3 - CSA Copper Mine Production Guidance_ **\n\n**Year** |  **2024** |  **2025** |  **2026**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Low** |  **High** |  **Low** |  **High** |  **Low** |  **High**  \nCopper Production (t)  |  38,000  |  43,000  |  43,000  |  48,000  |  48,000  |  53,000   \n  \nThis 3-year production guidance is based primarily on Ore Reserves but also on Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources (as at 31 August 2023) and, given that all the deposits are open and a large drill program is underway, we consider it likely that there will be changes over the relevant period as the Company’s overall plan to continue operational and production improvement continues to develop. \n\n**Changes to Board of Directors**\n\n**Appointment of Ms Anne Templeman-Jones**\n\nAs announced on 22 July 2024, Ms Templeman-Jones has been appointed as a Non-Executive Director of the Company’s Board of Directors, effective 22 July 2024. Ms Templeman-Jones, is an accomplished listed company director with substantial financial, operational risk, regulatory, governance and strategy experience from a number of industries, including banking and finance, engineering services in the energy sector, consumer goods and manufacturing. \n\nIn addition to Metals Acquisition Limited, Ms Templeman-Jones recently served as a Non-Executive Director, and was responsible for a diverse range of committee chairs and memberships for Commonwealth Bank of Australia (Director March 2018 to October 2024) and Trifork Ag (Director since April 2021). From November 2017 until 1 July 2024, Ms Templeman-Jones was a director of Worley Limited. \n\n**Change of Glencore Nominee Director**\n\nAs announced on 22 July 2024, Mr Mohit Rungta will replace Mr Matt Rowlinson and Mr John Burton as Glencore’s nominee Director to the Company’s Board of Directors. Glencore is entitled to nominate one Director for every 10% it holds in the Company. Following completion of the Company’s ASX listing, warrant redemption and recent placement Glencore now has a 12.13% interest (entitling it to one nominee). \n\n**Hedging**\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company delivered 3,105 tonnes of copper into the hedge book at an average price of US$3.72/lb. At the end of June 2024, the remaining copper hedge book consisted of the following: \n\n**_Table 4 – Hedge position_ **\n\n**Copper**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2025** |  **2026** |  **Total**  \nFuture Sales (t)  |  3,105  |  12,420  |  5,175  |  20,700   \nFuture Sales ($/t)  |  3.72  |  3.72  |  3.72  |  3.72   \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the Company’s third quarter 2024 results on Monday, October 21, 2024 at 6:00 pm (New York time) / Tuesday, October 22, 2024 at 9:00 am (Sydney time). \n\nDetails for the conference call and webcast are included below. \n\nWebcast  Participants can access the webcast at the following link [https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=lgTwEDVD](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DlgTwEDVD&esheet=54139414&newsitemid=20241021535643&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DlgTwEDVD&index=1&md5=20bb349928d74b93a663b89a95344b1c)\n\nConference Call  Participants can dial into the live call by dialing one of the numbers below and request the operator connect to the Metals Acquisition Limited call.

The Ore Reserves, Mineral Resources and Production Target are reported in MAC’s ASX Announcement dated 23 April 2024 titled ‘Updated Resource and Reserve Statement and Production Guidance’ (the “ **R &R Announcement** ”). The Company is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the R&R Announcement, and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates or Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources in the R&R Announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. The material assumptions underpinning the Production Target in the R&R Announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. It is a requirement of the ASX Listing Rules that the reporting of ore reserves and mineral resources in Australia comply with the JORC Code. Investors outside Australia should note that while exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves estimates of MAC in this release comply with the JORC Code, they may not comply with the relevant guidelines in other countries and, in particular, do not comply with (i) National Instrument 43-101 (Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects) of the Canadian Securities Administrators; or (ii) the requirements adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its Subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Information contained in this release describing mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of Canadian or US securities laws. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis release includes “forward-looking statements.” The forward-looking information is based on the Company’s expectations, estimates, projections and opinions of management made in light of its experience and its perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, as well as other factors that management of the Company believes to be relevant and reasonable in the circumstances at the date that such statements are made, but which may prove to be incorrect. Assumptions have been made by the Company regarding, among other things: the price of copper, continuing commercial production at the CSA Copper Mine without any major disruption, the receipt of required governmental approvals, the accuracy of capital and operating cost estimates, the ability of the Company to operate in a safe, efficient and effective manner and the ability of the Company to obtain financing as and when required and on reasonable terms. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors and assumptions which may have been used by the Company. Although management believes that the assumptions made by the Company and the expectations represented by such information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. \n\nMAC’s actual results may differ from expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward- looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, MAC’s expectations with respect to future performance of the CSA Copper Mine. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside MAC’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the supply and demand for copper; the future price of copper; the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures and requirements for additional capital; cash flow provided by operating activities; unanticipated reclamation expenses; claims and limitations on insurance coverage; the uncertainty in Mineral Resource estimates; the uncertainty in geological, metallurgical and geotechnical studies and opinions; infrastructure risks; and other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in MAC’s other filings with the SEC and the ASX. MAC cautions that the foregoing list of factors is not exclusive. MAC cautions readers not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. MAC does not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based. \n\nMore information on potential factors that could affect MAC’s or CSA Copper Mine’s financial results is included from time to time in MAC’s public reports filed with the SEC and the ASX. If any of these risks materialize or MAC’s assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks that MAC does not presently know, or that MAC currently believes are immaterial, that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect MAC’s expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this communication. MAC anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its assessments to change. However, while MAC may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, MAC specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, except as required by law. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing MAC’s assessment as of any date subsequent to the date of this communication. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements. \n\n**Non-IFRS financial information**\n\nMAC’s results are reported under International Financial Reporting Standards (“ **IFRS** ”), noting the results in this report have not been audited or reviewed. This release may also include certain non-IFRS measures including C1, Total Cash costs and Free Cash Flow. These C1, Total Cash cost and Free Cash Flow measures are used internally by management to assess the performance of our business, make decisions on the allocation of our resources and assess operational management. Non-IFRS measures have not been subject to audit or review and should not be considered as an indication of or alternative to an IFRS measure of financial performance. \n\n**C1 Cash Cost**\n\nC1 costs are defined as the costs incurred to produce copper at an operational level. This includes costs incurred in mining, processing and general and administration as well freight and realisation and selling costs. By-product revenue is credited against these costs to calculate a dollar per pound metric. This metric is used as a measure operational efficiency to illustrate the cost of production per pound of copper produced. \n\n**Total Cash Cost**\n\nTotal cash costs include C1 cash costs plus royalties and sustaining capital less inventory WIP movements. This metric is used as a measure operational efficiency to further illustrate the cost of production per pound of copper produced whilst incurring government-based royalties and capital to sustain operations. \n\n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property, plant, equipment and mineral interests. This measure, which is used internally to evaluate our underlying cash generation performance and the ability to repay creditors and return cash to shareholders, provides investors with the ability to evaluate our underlying performance. \n\n____________________ 1 See “Non-IFRS financial information” and refer to Table 2 for reconciliation of C1 Cash Cost 2 See “Non-IFRS financial information” 3 Realised provisional sales price excluding hedging impact 4 Valued at close of trading on ASX on 14 October 2024 5 Placement proceeds converted into US$ based on an A$:US$ exchange rate of 0.6869, which represents the average exchange rate for the week from 30 September 2024 to 4 October 2024 (inclusive) 6 Includes equity raised of ~US103 million gross proceeds of ~A$150 million (~US$103 million) at an issue price of A$18.00 per New CDI as announced on 9 October 2024 7 See “Non-IFRS Information” and refer to Table 2 for reconciliation of C1 Cash Cost. 8 Q2 2024 adjusted post finalisation of half year accounts with additional freight and TCRCs included accrued for recognition of June pre-sales 9 Excludes corporate costs from parent entity.

C1 costs are defined as the costs incurred to produce copper at an operational level. This includes costs\nincurred in mining, processing and general and administration as well freight and realisation and selling costs. By-product revenue is credited against these costs to calculate a dollar per pound metric. This metric is used as a\nmeasure operational efficiency to illustrate the cost of production per pound of copper produced. Total cash costs include C1 cash costs plus royalties and sustaining capital less inventory WIP movements. This metric is used\nas a measure operational efficiency to further illustrate the cost of production per pound of copper produced whilst incurring government-based royalties and capital to sustain operations.
