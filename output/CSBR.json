Organization, Use of Estimates and Basis of Presentation\nChampions Oncology, Inc. (the \"Company\", \"us\", \"we\", and \"our\") is a technology-enabled research organization engaged\nin creating technology solutions to be utilized in drug discovery and development. The Company's research center operates in\nboth regulatory and non-regulatory environments and consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Its pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and development\nat lower costs and increased speeds.\nThe Company has four operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited, Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, Champions Oncology, S.R.L. (Italy), and Corellia A.I.. For the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, there were\nno revenues earned by these subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s functional currency for its foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are\nrecognized in earnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s\ninternational operations.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The Company operates in one reportable business segment.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Certain\ninformation related to the Company’s organization, significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included\nin financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP has been condensed or omitted. The April 30, 2024 condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet in the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements was derived from audited\nconsolidated financial statements. The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements\nfor the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, as filed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on July 19, 2024\n(the \"Annual Report\"). In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all\nmaterial adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods\npresented and the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate when read in conjunction with the Annual Report. The\nresults of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full fiscal year.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements are\ndisclosed in our 2024 Annual Report and there have been no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during\nthe three months ended July 31, 2024.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements—\nGoing Concern (“ASC 205-40”), the Company has the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise\nsubstantial doubt about its ability to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial\nstatements are issued. As required under ASC 205-40, management’s evaluation should initially not take into consideration the\npotential mitigating effects of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements\nare issued. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern.\nIn performing this evaluation, we concluded that under the standards of ASC 205-40 the following conditions raised\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern:\n• a history of net losses, including a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ending April 30 2024;\n• cash used in operations of $6.1 million for the year ended April 30, 2024 and cash provided for the three months ended\nJuly 31, 2024 of $311,000;\n• working capital deficit of $6.0 million as of July 31, 2024; and\n• an accumulated deficit of $83.3 million as of July 31, 2024.\nThe Company's liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the\nlaunch of new products, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Most recently, the Company has met these\ncash requirements through cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, the\nCompany has also received proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities. While the Company\nbelieves it has strategies to increase revenues and reduce costs which can be implemented without disrupting the business or\ncompletely restructuring the Company, there can be no assurances. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital\nor seek to obtain financing, there can be no assurance that management would be successful in raising such capital or obtaining\nsuch financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock options.\nThe following table reflects these calculations. Note, as of July 31, 2023, all of the Company's potential common stock\nwas considered anti-dilutive.\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands) 2024 2023\nBasic net income (loss) per share computation:\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 1,313 $ (2,566)\nWeighted Average common shares – basic 13,593,766 13,506,782\nBasic net income (loss) per share $ 0.10 $ (0.19)\nDiluted net income (loss) per share computation:\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 1,313 $ (2,566)\nWeighted Average common shares 13,593,766 13,506,782\nIncremental shares from assumed exercise of stock options 448,613 —\nAdjusted weighted average share – diluted 14,042,379 13,506,782\nDiluted net income (loss) per share $ 0.09 $ (0.19)\nThe following table reflects the total potential share-based instruments outstanding at July 31, 2024 and 2023 including\nthose that could have an effect on the future computation of dilution per common share, had their effect not been anti-dilutive\ndue to the Company's net losses in the related periods:\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,131,624 1,766,752\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of\nexpenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the\nlikelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the\nextent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient earnings history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company's\nability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be limited if the Company\nhad undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n“IRC”). The Company adjusts the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that\ndeferred tax assets will or will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax\nprovision in the period of change. As of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the Company provided a valuation allowance for all\nnet deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the assets will not be recovered based on an insufficient history of\nearnings.\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain the tax\nposition, based on its technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest\namount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company recorded $181,000 of liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations as of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany did not recognize interest or penalties on its consolidated statements of operations during the three month period\nended July 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during the next 12\nmonths.\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 was $21,000 and $28,000, respectively.\nThe provision is mainly attributable to taxable income earned in Israel and/or Italy relating to transfer pricing, and U.S. state\nincome taxes for which net operating losses are limited.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606 (\"ASC 606\"),\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or\nservices to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for\nthose goods or services.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company's arrangements are service type contracts that mainly\nhave a duration of less than a year. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is transferred to the\ncustomer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to\nbe entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the following five steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract (promised goods\nor services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of the product or service for each\nperformance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities, such as value\nadded taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms. Unbilled services are classified as a component of accounts receivable on the balance sheet.\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as the Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\")\n2023-07, “Segment Reporting” (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new guidance is intended\nto improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses. The ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of\nthis ASU will have on its financial statements and related disclosures, which is not expected to be material.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Improvements to Tax Disclosures” (Topic 740). The new guidance is\nintended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures through changes to the rate\nreconciliation and the income taxes paid information disclosed. The ASU is effective retrospectively for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

The Company capitalizes certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the project\nitself will be completed and the software will perform as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related\nexpenses for employees and costs of third-party consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to these\ninternal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is\nready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades, increased functionality, and enhancements to the\nCompany's internal-use software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance, and minor\nmodifications are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method\nover an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nFinance Lease\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained as\nthe result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $368,000 at inception through June 2027.\nCash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase commitment\nagreement.

In general,\nthese Plans provide for stock-based compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and non-employees. The Plans also\nprovide for limits on the aggregate number of shares that may be granted, the term of grants and the strike price of option\nawards.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nAs part of the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan\n(“2021 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to grant (i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Incentive Stock\nOptions; (iii) Restricted Stock Awards; and/or (iv) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based compensation) to its\nemployees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2021 Equity Plan shall not exceed 2 million shares of\ncommon stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of grant and the awards vest\nas determined by the Company's Board of Directors. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have a strike price not less than\n100% of the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option or right at the date of grant. As of July 31, 2024,\napproximately 1.3 million shares were available for issue under this plan.\nStock Option Grants\nBlack-Scholes assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the three months ended July 31, 2024\nand 2023 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2024 2023\nExpected term in years 6 6\nRisk-free interest rates 4.48% 3.95%\nVolatility 62.72% 62.83%\nDividend yield —% —%\nThe weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 was $3.02\nand $3.72, respectively.\nThe Company’s stock options activity for the three months ended July 31, 2024 was as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nDirectors Average Remaining Aggregate\nand Non- Exercise Contractual Intrinsic\nEmployees Employees Total Price Life (Years) Value\nOutstanding, April 30, 2024 1,883,166 36,331 1,919,497 $ 5.04 5.2 $ 2,172,000\nGranted 1,000 — 1,000 4.90 9.8\nExercised — — — —\nForfeited — — — —\nCanceled (500) — (500) 6.11\nExpired — — — —\nOutstanding, July 31, 2024 1,883,666 36,331 1,919,997 5.04 5.0 $ 2,125,000\nVested and expected to vest as of\nJuly 31, 2024 1,883,666 36,331 1,919,997 5.04 5.0 $ 2,125,000\nExercisable as of July 31, 2024 1,551,829 3,750 1,555,579 4.74 4.1 $ 2,125,000\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn March 29, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to\nan aggregate of $5.0 million of the Company’s common stock. The share repurchase program is designed in accordance with\nRule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). The shares may be purchased from\ntime to time in the open market, as permitted under applicable rules and regulations, at prevailing market prices. The timing and\namount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The\nprogram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum number of shares. As of July 31, 2024, the Company had\npurchased 120,333 shares of its common stock, at an average price of $5.73 per share, totaling approximately $708,000 and\nleaving an available balance of approximately $4.3 million authorized by the Board for use in the program as of that date.\nNote 7. Leases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the\ndefinition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a\nright-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate\nimplicit in the lease, if applicable, or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. As the Company's leases do not provide an\nimplicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement\ndate in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments\neach period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and\nthe amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company currently leases certain office equipment and its office and laboratory facilities under non-cancelable\noperating leases. Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the lease\ncommencement date through the scheduled expiration date. Rent expense totaled $454,000 for the three months ended July 31,\n2024 and 2023. The Company considers its facilities adequate for its current operational needs.\nThe Company leases the following facilities:\n• One University Plaza, Suite 307, Hackensack, New Jersey 07601, which, since November 2011, serves as the Company’s\ncorporate headquarters. The lease expires in November 2026.

The Company executed the original lease in January 2017. The\nlease was amended to expand the premises and extend the expiration date in March 2020 and again in December 2020. The\noperating commencement date was August 11, 2017. This lease expires in February 2029. The Company recognized\n$422,000 and $423,000 of rent expense relative to this lease for both the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n• VIA LEONE XIII, 14, Milan, Italy, which consists of laboratory and office space where the Company conducts operations\nrelated to its flow cytometry service offerings. The Company executed separate leases for its laboratory space and office\nspace during fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, the Company executed a new lease to consolidate its office and laboratory\nspace at a new nearby location in Italy. The lease expires October 31, 2028 and it replaces the previous two leases, which\nwere terminated during fiscal year 2023. The Company recognized $13,000 of rent expense relative to its current lease for\nboth the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023.\nROU assets and lease liabilities related to our current operating leases are as follows (in thousands):\nJuly 31, 2024 April 30, 2024\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net $ 5,963 $ 6,252\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 1,369 1,337\nNon-current portion of operating lease liabilities 5,738 6,093\nAs of July 31, 2024, the weighted average remaining operating lease term and the weighted average discount rate were 4.49\nyears and 5.88%, respectively.

As of July 31, 2024, $0 was due to this related party.\nNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is not currently party to any legal matters to its knowledge. The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March\n2015 private placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into Patient Derived Xenograft\n(PDX) models and use in our pharmacology TOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from nil to\n$30,000 per tumor sample depending on the successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable\nproduct. The upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, under certain agreements, for a limited period of time, the\nCompany is subject to royalty payments if the licensed tumor models are used for sale in our TOS business, ranging from 2% to\n20% of the contract price after recouping certain initiation costs. Some of these arrangements also set forth an annual minimum\nroyalty due regardless of tumor models used for sale. For the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we have recognized\napproximately $81,000 and $73,000, respectively, in expense related to these royalty arrangements.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in\nconjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Report and\nour 2024 Annual Report.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Report contains certain “forward-looking statements,” which include information relating to future events, future\nfinancial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment, regulation, and availability of resources. These\nforward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: proposed new programs; expectations that\nregulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,\nor liquidity; statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates, or forecasts as to our business, financial\nand operational results, and future economic performance; and statements of management’s goals and objectives and other\nsimilar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,”\n“predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar\nexpressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be\naccurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are\nbased on information available at the time those statements are made or management’s good faith belief as of that time with\nrespect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. Factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in “Risk Factors”\nin Part I, Item 1A of our 2024 Annual Report, as updated in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC, including any updates\nfound in Part II, Item 1A of this or other reports on Form 10-Q, if any. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-\nlooking statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in\nassumptions, or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required by applicable\nsecurities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make\nadditional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized\nin drug discovery and development. Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can simulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (the \"Platform\"), a comprehensive bank\nof unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\nWe offer Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), an oncology data-driven Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") program. Our Lumin\nsoftware contains comprehensive information derived from our research services and clinical studies. Lumin leverages our large\nDatacenter coupled with analytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational cancer research. Insights\ndeveloped using Lumin can provide the basis for biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance,\nand guide the direction of additional preclinical evaluations.\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other advanced computational\nanalytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental platforms to validate\nthese targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. All expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUnder ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (“ASC 205-40”), the Company has the\nresponsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial\nobligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The following conditions\nraised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern: a history of net losses, working capital deficits,\naccumulated deficit and declining cash position. Going concern matters are more fully discussed in Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. No adjustments have been made to the financials\nstatements as a result this uncertainty.\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Most recently, we have met these cash requirements\nthrough cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received\nproceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities. For the three months ended July 31, 2024, the\nCompany had net income of approximately $1.3 million and cash provided by operations of approximately $311,000. As of\nJuly 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $83.3 million and cash on hand of approximately $2.9\nmillion. While we believe we have strategies to increase our revenues and reduce our costs which can be implemented without\ndisrupting the business or completely restructuring the Company, there can be no assurances. In order to continue to fund our\noperations we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital in the near term and cannot provide any assurance that we will\nbe successful in doing so, and if we can, on whether the terms will be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional\nfinancing in the near future, we may be required to pursue a reorganization proceeding, including under applicable bankruptcy\nor insolvency laws.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended July 31,\n% of % of %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 14,061 100.0 % $ 12,561 100.0 % 11.9 %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 7,072 50.3 7,684 61.2 (8.0)\nResearch and development 1,454 10.3 2,793 22.2 (47.9)\nSales and marketing 1,679 11.9 1,696 13.5 (1.0)\nGeneral and administrative 2,527 18.0 2,940 23.4 (14.0)\nTotal costs and operating expenses 12,732 90.5 15,113 120.3 (15.8)\nLoss from operations $ 1,329 9.5 % $ (2,552) (20.3) % (152.1) %\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from pharmacology studies, was $14.1 million and $12.6 million\nfor the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of $1.5 million or 11.9%. Operational\nimprovements and efficiencies implemented in the prior year led to an increase in our bookings to revenue conversion\npercentage contributing to the revenue growth.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 were $7.1 million and $7.7 million,\nrespectively, a decrease of $612,000 or 8.0%.

General and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of\ncompensation, insurance, professional fees, IT and depreciation and amortization expenses. The decrease for the three months\nended July 31, 2024 was primarily from a decrease in compensation and employee recruitment expenses.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the three months ended July 31, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $311,000. The cash provided by\noperating activities was primarily due to income from operations offset by changes in our working capital accounts in the\nordinary course of business.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0 and $668,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe cash used in investing activities for the prior year period was for the investment in additional lab and computer equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $37,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and $590,000 for the three\nmonths ended July 31, 2023. The cash used in the current year was for financing lease payments. The cash used in the prior\nyear period was for the Company's stock repurchase program offset slightly by cash received from stock option exercises.\nFactors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and\nvolatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other\nthings, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates,\nsupply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the effects of the resurgence of COVID-19 and/or its\nvariants or the emergence of new viruses, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle\nEast. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration, or magnitude or the\nextent to which they may negatively impact our business.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to\napply methodologies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company include, among other things, accounts receivable\nrealization, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe Company’s critical accounting policies are summarized in our 2024 Annual Report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that\nare not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee\nany third-party debt.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the\ninformation otherwise required under this Item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIt is management’s responsibility to establish and maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief\nFinancial Officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this Report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes\nthat any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of\nachieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the\nrelationship between the benefit of desired controls and procedures and the cost of implementing new controls and procedures.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. Based\non that assessment, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 31, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated\nto management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure. Further, management concluded that our consolidated financial statements in this Report present\nfairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the\nperiods presented, in conformity with GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

In addition, any forward-looking statements we make in this Annual Report speak only as of the date of this\ndocument, and we do not intend to update any such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur\nafter that date, except as required by law. As a result of these and other factors, our stock price may fluctuate dramatically.\nPART I\nItem 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating technology solutions to be utilized in drug discovery\nand development. Our research center operates in both regulatory and non-regulatory environments and consists of a\ncomprehensive set of computational and experimental research platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are\ndesigned to facilitate drug discovery and development at lower costs and increased speeds.\nAt the core of our research platforms is our unique, proprietary bank of Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models. This\npreeminent bank of PDX models is deployed into advanced in vivo and ex vivo pharmacology platforms, providing an\nenhanced level of insight into therapeutic programs. We currently have approximately 1,500 PDX Models in our TumorBank\nthat we believe reflect the characteristics of patients who enroll in clinical trials (late stage, pretreated and metastatic). This\ncharacteristic of our TumorBank is an important differentiator to other established PDX banks. We implant and expand these\ntumors in mice, which allows for future studies and additional characterization of the tumor. Additional analytical and\npharmacology experimental platforms are also available to augment the information gained from studies performed.\nThe PDX bank is highly characterized at the molecular, phenotypic and pharmacological levels, which provides a\ndifferentiated layer of data for our large oncology dataset (the \"Datacenter\"). The Datacenter combines our proprietary dataset\nwith other large publicly available datasets. This dataset currently includes approximately 3,500 molecular datasets (genomics,\ntranscriptomics, proteomics, phosphor-proteomics), approximately 3,000 clinical drug responses, approximately 3,500 in vivo\ndrug responses, and the accompanying clinical information on the patients from which they were derived (pre and post tumor\nsample acquisition of drug treatments and responses, age, gender, ethnicity, tumor stage, tumor grade, location of tumor biopsy,\nhistology, etc.) derived from our TumorBank. One unique feature of this proprietary dataset is the fact that it is derived from a\nliving TumorBank. This allows us to continue characterizing the TumorBank over time and increase the depth of\ncharacterization of the accumulated data. The combination of the breadth and depth of the TumorBank, and associated\ncharacterization, drives the value of our Datacenter. The Datacenter also includes approximately 20,000 publicly available\ndatasets including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and functional genomics, and patient outcome. This Datacenter\nfacilitates our computational approach to drug discovery and provides the foundation to our Software as a Service (\"SaaS\")\nofferings. Collectively, our computational and experimental research platforms enable a more rapid and precise approach to\ndrug discovery and development.\nThrough our technology platforms, we have designed an ecosystem of business lines consisting of:\n• The sale of research services utilizing our innovative research platforms to biopharmaceutical companies\n• The sale of oncology research SaaS tools to cancer research scientists\n• The discovery and development of novel oncology therapeutics\n2\nTranslational Oncology Solutions (TOS) Business\nResearch Services\nOur research services utilize our research center to assist pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with their drug\ndevelopment process. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of experimental oncology drugs or\napproved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can simulate the results of human clinical trials.\nThese studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our TumorBank in mice and testing the\ntherapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that reveal the differences in the genetic\nsignatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not respond. Our studies can be used to\ndetermine which types of cancer, if any, may be inhibited by a drug. The studies can also be used to identify specific sub-\npopulations, often characterized by particular genetic mutations that are differentially sensitive or resistant to a drug or drug\ncombination. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nIncreasing the breadth of the TumorBank is an important strategic effort of the Company. We invest significant research and\ndevelopment resources to increase the number of PDX Models in our TumorBank and add unique and different sub-types of\ncancer that are not historically addressed. This effort also allows us to build highly valuable PDX models derived from patients\nwith resistance to specific therapies or important molecular annotations. We also invest significant resources to increase the\ndepth of characterization of the TumorBank. For each model, this characterization includes phenotypic analysis, molecular\nanalyses, and pharmacologic analysis. This depth of characterization, in an individual tumor basis, is unique and not widely\navailable.\nWe have performed studies for approximately 500 different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies over the past ten\nyears, have a high rate of repeat business, and contract with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies across North\nAmerica, Europe and Asia. Studies are performed in a preclinical non-regulatory environment, as well as a Good Clinical\nRegulatory Practice (GCLP) regulatory environment for clinical evaluation. Typical studies are in the $125,000 price range,\nwith an increasing number of studies in the $250,000 to $500,000 range. Studies performed in a regulatory environment can be\nmuch larger than those performed within a non-regulatory environment. Revenue from this business has grown at an average\nannual growth rate of 13% since 2019 and represents the primary source of our current revenue stream.\nSoftware As A Service (SaaS) Business\nOur SaaS business, launched during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, is centered around our proprietary software\nplatform and data tool, Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), which contains comprehensive information derived from our research\nservices and clinical studies and is sold to customers on an annual subscription basis. The software was developed by a team\nthat consisted of bioinformatics scientists and mathematicians as well as software engineers. Lumin leverages Champions’ large\nDatacenter coupled with analytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational cancer research. It is the\ncombination of the Datacenter and the analytics that create the foundation for Lumin. Insights developed using Lumin can\nprovide the basis for biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and guide the direction of\nadditional preclinical evaluations. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, we recorded an impairment charge for the\ncapitalized software development costs of Lumin related to return on investment guidelines. However, we continue to maintain\nthe Lumin platform and sell subscriptions as part of our product offerings as the Lumin data is an integral part of the\nCompany’s long term strategy and value proposition.\nDrug Discovery and Development Business\nOur nascent drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other advanced computational\nanalytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental platforms to rapidly\nvalidate these targets for further drug development efforts. Our efforts center around three areas of focus:\n1. Targeted therapy with drug conjugates\n2. Immune oncology\n3. Cell therapy\n3\nOur drug discovery and development business is dependent on a dedicated research and development team, made up of\ncomputational and experimental scientists. Importantly, the scientific teams within our Drug Discovery and Development teams\nare appropriately segregated from our other businesses.\nWe have a rich pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nOur sales and marketing efforts are dependent on a dedicated sales force of approximately 27 professionals that sell our\nservices directly to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our research services team is focused on identifying and\nselling studies to new customers as well as increasing our revenue from our existing customer base. We spend significant\nresources in informing our customers and reaching out to new contacts within companies that we currently serve. These efforts\nare aimed at moving our customers along the adoption curve for our research platforms, thereby increasing the number of\nstudies and the average study size. Our success in these efforts is demonstrated by the growing number of customers who have\nincreased their annual spend on our services over the years.\nFor the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, revenues from our products and services totaled approximately $50.1 million, a\ndecrease of approximately 7% from the previous year.\nOur Current Strategy\nOur strategy is to use our various platform technologies to drive multiple synergistic revenue streams. We continue to build\nupon this with investments in research and development. Our enterprise strategy consists of the following:\n• Establish a global leadership position in oncology research\n• A focus on bringing better drugs to patients faster\n• Leading innovation in oncology research and development platforms\n• Cultivating a solid reputation for the quality of data acquisition and interpretation\n• Collaborations across the global biopharma landscape\n• Profitable growth across all business lines\nOur Growth and Expansion Strategy\nOur strategy is to continue to use our various platform technologies to drive multiple synergistic revenue streams.\nOur strategy for growth has multiple components:\n• Growing our TumorBank: We grow our TumorBank in two ways. First, we leverage a medical affairs team that works\nwith a well-established clinical network to facilitate access to patients diagnosed with prioritized tumor subtypes.\nSecond, we maintain the ability to utilize our legacy Personalized Oncology Services business to establish novel PDX\nmodels from patients who use this service. The PDX models are then deeply characterized at the phenotypic,\nmolecular, and pharmacologic levels. This data characterization is then added to our Datacenter.\n• Adding new experimental technologies: The fields of oncology research and drug development are evolving rapidly.\nTo keep up with new approaches, we continuously add new technologies to platform. We are currently investing in\ndeveloping additional proprietary pharmacology platforms aimed at enhancing the scientific output and driving\ninnovation in the oncology research sector. We are also investing in the development of sophisticated analytical\nplatforms which allow scientists to derive deeper insights when using our pharmacology platforms. Once these\nexperimental technologies are established they are made available to our research and development and target\ndiscovery teams.\n• Computational power: We have developed sophisticated and innovative computational approaches. We have also\ninvested in the development of novel artificial intelligence, data structures, and analytics. Our goal is to leverage our\n4\nunique Datacenter to establish elegant ways to better understand the molecular dynamics of cancer, and the\ndevelopment of novel therapeutics.\nCompetition\nChampions currently competes in three different markets:\nResearch Services: Pharmaceutical companies rely on outsourcing preclinical studies to Clinical Research Organizations.\nCompetition in this industry is intense and based significantly on scientific, technological, and market forces, which include the\neffectiveness of the technology and products and the ability to commercialize technological developments. The Company faces\nsignificant competition from other healthcare companies in the United States and abroad. The majority of these competitors are,\nand will be, substantially larger than the Company, and have substantially greater resources and operating histories. There can\nbe no assurance that developments by other companies will not render our products or technologies obsolete or non-competitive\nor that we will be able to keep pace with the technological or product developments of our competitors. These companies, as\nwell as academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations also compete with us in recruiting and\nretaining highly qualified scientific, technical and professional personnel and consultants.\nSaaS: There are two important components of Lumin: the Datacenter and the Analytics. While we feel our Datacenter is\nunique, there are a large number of publicly available datasets that can be accessed free of charge for computational research.\nThis publicly available data repertoire is constantly growing as academic labs publish results. We continue to find ways to\ndifferentiate our dataset, however there can be no assurance that developments by other companies or academic institutions in\ndata curation will not render our Datacenter obsolete or non-competitive. The second component of Lumin is the data analytics.\nWhile there are a minimal number of software solutions that offer the degree of analytics available within Lumin, the know-\nhow and workflows of these analytics are well established in bioinformatics labs across academia and the biopharmaceutical\nindustry. As a result, the barrier to entry for developing a SaaS tool leveraging these analytics is relatively low.\nDrug Discovery and Development: Our Drug Discovery and Development business places us in a good position of also\ncompeting against the same customers of our Research Services and/or SaaS businesses: the global biopharmaceutical industry.\nThe global oncology drug market is estimated to be as high as $223 billion in 2023. Competition in this industry is strong and\nbased significantly on scientific and technological forces, which rely solely on the effectiveness of therapeutics designed to treat\ncancer. The Company faces significant competition from other biopharmaceutical companies in the United States and abroad.\nThe competitors have a wide range of strategic and operational approaches. Our business strategy is to work with differentiated\ntherapeutic targets and research areas. However, given the intense degree of privacy from our competitors, we cannot guarantee\nthat others within the industry are not also working on these targets. Further, some competitors will operate with no laboratory\nor experimental operations, while others will have varying degrees of laboratory space and experimental capabilities. There can\nbe no assurance that developments by other companies will not render experimental platforms obsolete or non-competitive or\nthat we will be able to keep pace with the technological or product developments of our competitors. These companies, as well\nas academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations also compete with us in recruiting and\nretaining highly qualified scientific, technical and professional personnel and consultants.\nResearch and Development\nFor the fiscal years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, we spent approximately $9.5 million and $11.5 million, respectively, to\nfurther develop our platforms. We continue to expand our TumorBank via the inclusion of tumor tissue and implanted models\nthrough research collaborations and relationships with hospitals and academic institutions. Our research and development\nefforts were focused on increasing our understanding of our TumorGraft models, their clinical predictability, improving growth\nand tumor take rates, and other biological and molecular characteristics of the models. We are investing in developing\nadditional proprietary pharmacology platforms aimed at enhancing the scientific output and driving innovation in the oncology\nresearch sector.\nWe are also investing in the acquisition of sophisticated analytical platforms which allow scientists to derive deeper insights\nwhen using our pharmacology platforms.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe research, development, and marketing of our products, the performance of our legacy Personalized Oncology Solutions\n(\"POS\") testing services, and the operation of our facilities are generally subject to federal, state, local, or foreign legislation,\n5\nincluding licensure of our laboratory located in Rockville, Maryland by the State of Maryland and compliance with federal,\nstate, local or foreign legislation applicable to the use of live animals in scientific testing, research and education.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory developed tests such\nas our legacy POS products, but has generally not exercised it. The FDA has announced regulatory and guidance initiatives that\ncould increase federal regulation of our business. We are subject to federal and international regulations with regard to shipment\nof hazardous materials, including those issued by the Department of Transportation and the International Air Transit Authority.\nThese regulations require interstate, intrastate, and foreign shipments to comply with applicable labeling, documentation, and\ntraining requirements.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of July 15, 2024, we had 210 full-time employees, including 96 with doctoral or other advanced degrees. Of our\nworkforce, 160 employees are engaged in research and development and laboratory operations, 30 employees are engaged in\nsales and marketing, and 20 employees are engaged in finance and administration.\nWe believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified\npersonnel. We continue to seek additions to our science and technical staff, although the competition for such personnel in the\npharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Attracting, developing, and retaining skilled and experienced\nemployees in our industry is crucial to our ability to compete effectively. Our ability to recruit and retain such employees\ndepends on a number of factors, including our corporate culture and work environment, our corporate philosophy, internal\ntalent development and career opportunities, and compensation and benefits.\nNone of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have never\nexperienced a work stoppage and believe our relationship with our employees is good.\nCompany History\nWe were incorporated as a merger and acquisition company under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 4, 1985, under\nthe name “International Group, Inc.” In September 1985, the Company completed a public offering and shortly thereafter\nacquired the worldwide rights to the Champions sports theme restaurant concept and changed its name to “Champions Sports,\nInc.” In 1997, the Company sold its Champions service mark and concept to Marriott International, Inc. and until 2005, was a\nconsultant to Marriott International, Inc. and operated one Champions Sports Bar Restaurant. In January 2007, the Company\nchanged its business direction to focus on biotechnology and subsequently changed its name to Champions Biotechnology, Inc.\nOn May 18, 2007, the Company acquired Biomerk, Inc., at which time we began focusing on our current line of business. In\nApril 2011, the Company changed its name to Champions Oncology, Inc. to reflect the Company's new strategic focus on\ndeveloping advanced technologies to personalize the development and use of oncology drugs.\nAvailable Information\nOur internet website address is www.championsoncology.com. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report.\nThrough our website, we make available, free of charge, access to all reports filed with the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission, (the \"SEC\"), including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our\nCurrent Reports on Form 8-K, our Proxy Statements on Schedules 14A and amendments to those reports, as filed with or\nfurnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we\nelectronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Copies of any materials we file with, or furnish to, the SEC can\nalso be obtained free of charge through the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Annual\nReport. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known, or\nthose we currently consider insignificant, may also impair our business operations in the future.\nWe historically incurred losses from operating activities, may require significant capital and may never achieve\nsustained profitability. These conditions raise a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\n6\nFor the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of approximately $7.3 million and used cash flows in\noperations of approximately $6.1 million. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.\nIn its report dated July 19, 2024, EisnerAmper LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, expressed\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we have suffered recurring losses from operations and have\ninsufficient liquidity to fund our future operations. If we are unable to improve our liquidity position, we may not be able to\ncontinue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might\nresult if we are unable to continue as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize our assets and discharge our\nliabilities other than in the normal course of business which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion\nof their investment. As of April 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.6 million. Based on our available cash at April 30, 2024,\nin order to continue to fund our operations we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital in the near term and cannot\nprovide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so. If we are unable to obtain additional financing in the near future,\nwe may be required to pursue a reorganization proceeding, including under applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws. Holders\nof our common shares will likely not receive any value or payments in a restructuring or similar scenario. In the event we\npursue bankruptcy protection, we will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with such proceedings. There can be\nno guarantees that if we seek bankruptcy protection, we will emerge from bankruptcy protection as a going concern or that\nholders of our common shares will receive any recovery from any bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe amount of our income or losses and liquidity requirements may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-\nquarter and will depend on, among other factors:\n• the cost of continuing to build out our TumorGraft bank;\n• the cost and rate of progress toward growing our technology platforms;\n• the cost and rate of progress toward building our business units;\n• the cost of increasing our research and development;\n• the cost of renting our laboratory and animal testing facilities and payment for associated services;\n• the timing and cost of obtaining and maintaining any necessary regulatory approvals;\n• the cost of expanding and building out our infrastructure; and\n• the cost incurred in hiring and maintaining qualified personnel.\nCurrently, we derive revenue primarily from research services, while pursuing efforts to further develop our drug discovery\nbusiness units.\nTo become sustainably profitable, we will need to generate revenues to offset our operating costs, including our research and\ndevelopment and general and administrative expenses. We may not achieve or sustain our revenue or profit objectives. If we\nincur losses in the future and/or we are unable to obtain sufficient capital either from operations or externals sources, ultimately,\nwe may have to cease operations.\nIn order to grow revenues, we must invest capital to implement our sales and marketing efforts and to successfully develop\nour technology platforms. Our sales and marketing efforts may never generate significant increases in revenues or achieve\nprofitability and it is possible that we will be required to raise additional capital to continue our operations. If we must devote a\nsubstantial amount of time to raising capital, it will delay our ability to achieve our business goals within the time frames that\nwe now expect, which could increase the amount of capital we need. In addition, the amount of time expended by our\nmanagement on fundraising distracts them from concentrating on our business affairs. If we require additional capital and are\nnot successful in raising the needed capital, we may have to cease operations.\nWe may incur greater costs than anticipated, which could result in sustained losses.\nWe use reasonable efforts to assess and predict the expenses necessary to pursue our business strategies. However,\nimplementing our business strategies may require more employees, capital equipment, supplies or other expenditure items than\nmanagement has predicted. Similarly, the cost of compensating additional management, employees and consultants or other\noperating costs may be more than we estimate, which could result in ongoing and sustained losses.\nWe may not be able to implement our business strategies, which could impair our ability to continue operations.\nImplementation of our business strategies will depend in large part on our ability to (i) attract and maintain a significant\nnumber of customers; (ii) effectively provide acceptable services to our customers; (iii) develop and license new products and\ntechnologies; (iv) maintain appropriate internal procedures, policies, and systems; (v) hire, train, and retain skilled employees\nand management; (vi) continue to operate despite increasing competition in our industry; and (vii) establish, develop and\n7\nmaintain our name recognition. Our inability to obtain or maintain any or all these factors could impair our ability to implement\nour business strategies successfully, which could have material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur laboratories are subject to regulation and licensure requirements, and the healthcare industry is highly\nregulated; we may face substantial penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.\nOur research services are performed in laboratories that are subject to state regulation and licensure requirements. Such\nregulation and requirements are subject to change, and may result in additional costs or delays in providing our products to our\ncustomers. In addition, the healthcare industry in general is highly regulated in the United States at both the federal and state\nlevels. We seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, but many of the laws and regulations potentially\napplicable to us are vague or unclear. These laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by an authority in a way that\ncould require us to make changes in our business. We may not be able to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to operate our\nbusiness or sell our products. If we fail to do so, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or fines or lose the\nauthorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third parties. If any of these events\nhappened, they could hurt our business and financial results.\nIf our laboratory facilities are damaged or destroyed, or we have a dispute with one of our landlords, our business\nwould be negatively affected.\nWe currently utilize several office suites where our laboratories are located within one facility in Rockville, Maryland. If this\nfacility was to be significantly damaged or destroyed, we could suffer a loss of our ongoing and future drug studies, as well as\nour TumorBank. In addition, we lease the laboratories from a third party. If we had a dispute with our landlord or otherwise\ncould not utilize our space, it would take time to find and move to a new facility, which could negatively affect our results of\noperations.\nAny health crisis impacting our colony of laboratory mice could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur research services operations depend on having a colony of live mice available. If this population experienced a health\ncrisis, such as a virus or other pathogen, such crisis would affect the success of our existing and future business, as we would\nhave to rebuild the population and repeat current studies.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our products and may need to rely on third parties to successfully\nmarket and sell our products and generate revenues.\nCurrently, we rely on the internet, word of mouth, and a small sales force to market our services. We have to compete with\nother pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life science technology and service companies to recruit, hire, train, and retain\nmarketing and sales personnel. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales, and as a\nresult, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe will continue to be dependent upon key employees.\nOur success, currently, is dependent upon the efforts of several full-time key employees, the loss of the services of one or\nmore of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We intend to continue to develop\nour management team and attract and retain qualified personnel in all functional areas to expand and grow our business. This\nmay be difficult in the healthcare industry where competition for skilled personnel is intense.\nBecause our industry is very competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources\nand more experience in research and development, we may not succeed in selling or increasing sales of our products and\ntechnologies.\nWe are engaged in a rapidly changing and highly competitive field. Potential competitors in the United States and abroad are\nnumerous and include providers of clinical research services, most of which have substantially greater capital resources and\nmore experience in research and development capabilities. Furthermore, new companies will likely enter our market from the\nUnited States and abroad, as scientific developments surrounding other pre-clinical and clinical services grow in the\nmultibillion dollar oncology marketplace. Our competitors may succeed in selling their products to our pharmaceutical and\nbiotech customers more effectively than we sell our products. In addition, academic institutions, hospitals, governmental\nagencies, and other public and private research organizations also may conduct similar research, seek patent protection, and\nmay develop and commercially introduce competing products or technologies on their own or through joint ventures. If one or\n8\nmore of our competitors succeeds in developing similar technologies and products that are more effective or successful than any\nof those that we currently sell or will develop, our results of operations will be significantly adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete as effectively.\nIt is important in the healthcare industry to obtain patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products, and\nprocesses. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to obtain, enjoy, and enforce protection for any products we have,\ndevelop or acquire under United States and foreign patent laws and other intellectual property laws, preserve the confidentiality\nof our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Where appropriate, we will seek patent\nprotection for certain aspects of our technology. However, while our TumorGraft Technology Platform is proprietary and\nrequires significant know-how to both initiate and operate, it is not patented. It is, therefore, possible for competitors to develop\nother implantation procedures, or to discover the same procedures utilized by us, that could compete with us in our market.\nIt also is unclear whether efforts to secure our trade secrets will provide useful protection. While we will use reasonable\nefforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary\ninformation to competitors resulting in a loss of protection. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using\nour trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts\noutside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Finally, our competitors may independently\ndevelop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be\nharmed.\nWe rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our\ncompetitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality\nagreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific\ncollaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also seek to enter into confidentiality\nand invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may\nbreach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain\nadequate remedies for such breaches. Our trade secrets may also be obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches\nof our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret\nis difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the\nUnited States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or\nindependently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it,\nfrom using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or\nindependently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nClaims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could adversely affect\nour financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.\nPatent applications are maintained in secrecy in the United States and also are maintained in secrecy outside the United States\nuntil the application is published. Accordingly, we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology\ninfringes the patents or patent applications of others. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-\nconsuming and could likely:\n• result in costly litigation;\n• divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n• require us to develop non-infringing technology; or\n• require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nResearch service studies are subject to cancellation based on changes in customer’s development plans.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from studies performed for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to assist in the\ndevelopment of oncology drugs. There are many factors that could result in the change of our customers development plans for\nspecific drugs, including without limitation to their research and development budgets and drug development strategies. These\nchanges could lead to the cancellation or modification of on-going or planned studies. This would have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s revenue growth and profit margin.\n9\nWe face competition in the life science market for computational software and for bioinformatics products.\nThe market for our computational software platform for the life science market is competitive. We currently face competition\nfrom other scientific software providers, larger technology and solutions companies, in-house development by our customers\nand academic and government institutions, and the open-source community. Some of our competitors and potential competitors\nhave longer operating histories in certain segments of our industry than we do and could have greater financial, technical,\nmarketing, research and development, and other resources. We could also face competition from open-source software\ninitiatives, in which developers provide software and intellectual property free over the Internet. In addition, some of our\ncustomers spend significant internal resources in order to develop their own software. There can be no assurance that our\ncurrent or potential competitors will not develop products, services, or technologies that are comparable to, superior to, or\nrender obsolete, the products, services, and technologies we offer. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not adapt\nmore quickly than we do to technological advances and customer demands, thereby increasing such competitors' market share\nrelative to ours. Any material decrease in demand for our technologies or services may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDrug development programs, particularly those in early stages of development, may never be commercialized.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to select successful product candidates, complete preclinical development\nof these product candidates and advance them to and through clinical trials. Early-stage product candidates in particular require\nsignificant investment in development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory clearances and substantial additional\ninvestment before they can be commercialized, if at all.\nOur research and development programs may not lead to commercially viable products for several reasons, and are subject to\nthe risks and uncertainties associated with drug development. For example, we may fail to identify promising product\ncandidates, our product candidates may fail to be safe and effective in preclinical tests or clinical trials, or we may have\ninadequate financial or other resources to pursue discovery and development efforts for new product candidates. From time to\ntime, we may establish and announce certain development goals for our product candidates and programs. However, given the\ncomplex nature of the drug discovery and development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve\nthese goals. If we are unsuccessful in advancing our research and development programs into clinical testing or in obtaining\nregulatory approval, our long-term business prospects will be harmed.\nImpairment of goodwill or other long-term assets may adversely impact future results of operations.\nWe have intangible assets and goodwill on our balance sheet. If the future growth and operating results of our business are not\nas strong as anticipated and/or our market capitalization declines, this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair\nvalue of goodwill or recoverability of any future capitalized software development costs. To the extent any future impairment\noccurs, the carrying value of our assets will be written down to an implied fair value and an impairment charge will be made to\nour income from continuing operations. Such an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership\nchange” (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the\ncorporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research\ntax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that our 2016 public offering, taken together with our\nprivate placements and other transactions that have occurred since then, may have triggered an “ownership change” limitation.\nWe may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if\nwe earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable\nincome may be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe have a limited market for our common stock, which makes our securities very speculative.\nTrading activity in our common stock is and has been limited. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of, or\nto obtain accurate quotations of the price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that a more active market for our\ncommon stock will develop, or if one should develop, there is no assurance that it will be sustained. This could severely limit\nthe liquidity of our common stock, and would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock\nand on our ability to raise additional capital. Furthermore, like many stocks quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, trading in our\ncommon stock is thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do\n10\nwith our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons\nunrelated to operating performance.\nInvestment in our common stock may be diluted if we issue additional shares in the future.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock, which will reduce shareholders’ percentage ownership and may dilute per\nshare value. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of July 18,\n2024, we had 13,714,099 shares of common stock issued and 13,593,766 outstanding. The future issuance of all or part of the\nremaining authorized common stock would result in substantial dilution in the percentage of the common stock held by existing\nshareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services, acquisitions, or other corporate actions may have the effect of\ndiluting the value of the shares held by existing shareholders, and might have an adverse effect on any market for our common\nstock.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities in the future, our\nstockholders may experience significant dilution. Sale of additional equity and/or convertible debt securities at prices below\ncertain levels will trigger anti-dilution provisions with respect to certain securities we have previously sold. If additional funds\nare raised through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, lenders under the credit facility or\nholders of these debt securities or preferred stock would likely have rights that are senior to the rights of holders of our common\nstock, and any credit facility or additional securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operation.\nPotential future sales or issuances of our common stock to raise capital, or the perception that such sales could occur,\ncould cause dilution to our current stockholders and the price of our common stock to fall.\nWe have historically supported our operations through the issuance of equity and may continue to do so in the future.\nAlthough we may not be successful in obtaining financing through equity sales on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, any\nsuch sales that do occur could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing holders of our common stock.\nAdditionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities to any new investors,\nor the anticipation of such sales, could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nOur stock price is volatile and therefore investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price\nthey paid for it.\nThe stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility\nthat has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may\nnot be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it. The market price for our common stock may be\ninfluenced by many factors, including:\n• regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n• variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n• changes in the healthcare payment system overseas to the degree we receive revenue from such healthcare systems\noverseas;\n• announcements by us of significant acquisition, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n• sales of significant shares of stock by large investors;\n• intellectual property, product liability, or other litigation against us; and\n• the other key facts described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws and of our contractual agreements contain provisions that could delay\nand discourage takeover attempts and any attempts to replace our current management by stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our contractual agreements could make it difficult for\nor prevent a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our board of directors (the \"Board\" or Board of Directors\") and\nmanagement. These provisions include:\n• requirements that our stockholders comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to\nour Board of Directors or to place stockholders’ proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of stockholders; and\n• in connection with private placements of our stock in 2011, 2013 and 2015, we covenanted that we would not merge or\nconsolidate with another company unless either the transaction and the trading volume of our stock met certain thresholds\n11\nand qualifications or we obtained the consent of certain of the investors who purchased our stock in those private\nplacements.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and make a takeover more\ndifficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in the stockholders’ interest.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult or delaying\nattempts by others to obtain control of us, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. We also\nare subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a\n“business combination” with an “interested stockholder” unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner\nand prohibit the voting of shares held by persons acquiring certain numbers of shares without obtaining requisite approval. The\nstatutes have the effect of making it more difficult to effect a change in control of a Delaware company.\nOur management and four significant stockholders collectively own a substantial majority of our common stock.\nCollectively, our officers, our directors and three significant stockholders own or exercise voting and investment control of\napproximately 71% of our outstanding common stock as of July 18, 2024. As a result, investors may be prevented from\naffecting matters involving our company, including:\n• the composition of our Board of Directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and\npolicies, including the appointment and removal of officers;\n• any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations;\n• our acquisition or disposition of assets; and\n• our corporate financing activities.\nFurthermore, this concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control\nor other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. This significant concentration of share\nownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in\nowning stock in a company that is controlled by a small number of stockholders.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends in the past and have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, which could\ncause the value of our common stock to have a lower value than other similar companies which do pay cash dividends.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate any cash dividends being paid to\nholders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and\ncapital needs of the business, it is anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion. As we have no\nplans to issue cash dividends in the future, our common stock could be less desirable to other investors and as a result, the value\nof our common stock may decline, or fail to reach the valuations of other similarly situated companies who have historically\npaid cash dividends in the past.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our\nmarket, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price of our common stock\nand trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts\nmay publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their\nrecommendation regarding our common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our\ncompetitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us was to cease coverage of our\ncompany or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause\nthe price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store information,\nto manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax\nrequirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be\nvulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our control such as catastrophic events,\nnatural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, employee error or malfeasance, security\nbreaches, computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks,\n12\nphishing, hacking, and other cyberattacks. While we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware\nthat we have experienced a material breach. Cyberattacks are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature and\nare becoming more sophisticated. Additionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the Russia-Ukraine military conflict,\nhas heightened the risk of cyberattacks. While we attempt to continuously monitor and mitigate against cyber risks, we may\nincur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents.\nSophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology\nsystems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems, including cloud-based\nplatforms. In addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer\nsystems to the risk of cyber-attacks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain\nthe proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and\ncollection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. If any of our significant information\ntechnology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve\nthe issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely\naffected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption,\nviolation of data privacy laws and regulations, litigation, and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information.\nAny interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that\nmay have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere may adversely affect our\nbusiness and we are unable to predict the potential impact.\nWe are subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. The global\nspread of COVID-19 resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak a “pandemic,” or a worldwide spread of\na new disease, in early 2020. This virus eventually spread world wide to most countries, and to all 50 states within the United\nStates. In response, most countries around the world imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings in an\neffort to contain the spread of the virus. Employers worldwide were also required to increase, as much as possible, the capacity\nand arrangement for employees to work remotely. The restrictions and travel bans have been eased or lifted completely as\nglobal society as a whole returned to pre-pandemic business and personal practices. Although, to date, these restrictions have\nnot materially impacted our operations, the effect on our business, from the spread of COVID-19 or any new and similar viral\ncrisis and the actions implemented by the governments of the United States and elsewhere across the globe implemeted to deal\nwith such, may, once again, worsen over time and we are unable to predict the potential impact on our business.\nAny outbreak of contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect\non our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel, pursue partnerships and other\nbusiness transactions, receive shipments of biologic materials, as well as be impacted by the temporary closure of the facilities\nof suppliers. The spread of an infectious disease, like COVID-19, may also result in the inability of our suppliers to deliver\nsupplies to us on a timely basis. In addition, health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone meetings with\nclients in response to the spread of an infectious disease. Though we have not yet experienced such events, if they would occur,\nthey could result in a period of business disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. However, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have not experienced\na material adverse effect on our business nor the need for reduction in our work force; and, currently, we do not expect any\nmaterial impact on our long-term activity. The extent to which any spread of disease, like that of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nimpacts our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not\nlimited to, information which may emerge concerning the spreading and severity of the any infectious diseases, the actions to\ncontain these, or treat their impact.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the effect of prolonged\nperiods of inflation on our customers and suppliers, could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions.\nThese conditions include but are not limited to inflation, rising interest rates, availability of capital markets, energy availability\nand costs (including fuel surcharges), the negative impacts caused by pandemics and public health crises (such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic), negative impacts resulting from the military conflicts between Russia and the Ukraine and/or in the\nMiddle East, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Impacts of such conditions could be\npassed on to our business in the form of a reduced customer base and/or potential for new bookings due to possible reductions\nin pharmaceutical and biotech industry-wide spend on research and development and/or economic pressure on our suppliers to\npass on increased costs.\n13\nOur Chief Executive Officer resides in Israel and we have several customers with their operations located in Israel,\nand, therefore, our leadership continuity and results may be adversely affected by political, economic, and military\ninstability in Israel.\nOne of our wholly owned subsidiaries is based in Israel. While we do not have a physical facility located in Israel, our\nChief Executive Officer resides there and we have several customers whose operations are based there. Accordingly, political,\neconomic, and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the modern State of\nIsrael in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring countries. Any hostilities\ninvolving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, and leadership continuity.\nAny armed conflicts, war, terrorist activities, or political instability in the region and the consequences thereof, such as\nour customers' ability to conduct operations and pay their suppliers of goods and services (such as our company), could\nadversely affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.\nIt is currently not possible to predict the duration or severity of the ongoing war or its effects on our business,\noperations, and financial conditions. The ongoing war is rapidly evolving and developing, and could disrupt our customers'\nbusiness and operations. While we have not experienced any disruptions that have materially impacted our business or results\nof operations, there can be no assurances that further unforeseen events will not have a material adverse effect on us or our\noperations in the future.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe believe we maintain an information technology and security program appropriate for a company of our size, taking\ninto account our operations and risks. We recognize the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our\ninvestors, employees, customers and vendors. Our cybersecurity policies and processes are integrated into the Company's\nenterprise risk management program. We have implemented processes designed to assess, identify, and manage risks from\npotential unauthorized occurrences on or through our information technology systems that may result in adverse effects on the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of these systems and the data residing therein. These processes include mechanisms,\ncontrols, and certain technologies designed to prevent or mitigate system intrusion or data loss, theft, misuse, or other security\nincidents or vulnerabilities and maintain a stable and secure information technology environment. For example, we conduct\nongoing monitoring of critical systems for any compromised or potentially compromised accounts. We conduct regular\ntrainings on cyber and information security, along with phishing simulations, among other topics. In addition, we consult with\nan outside information technology consultant on a regular basis to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing\ncybersecurity risks, including to anticipate future threats and trends, and their impact on the Company’s risk environment.\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors oversees our risk management process. The Audit Committee, by way of Board delegation,\nretains oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity risks. The senior leadership team, including our Chief Financial Officer and\nChief Executive Officer, provides periodic reports to our Board, as applicable. Our Vice President of Technology is responsible\nfor leading the assessment and management of cybersecurity threats and periodically updating the Audit Committee as needed.\nTo date, we have not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity\nincidents, that have materially affected us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nItem 2.

[Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and the related\nnotes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our\ncurrent expectations, estimates, and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially\nfrom those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including\nthose we discuss under Item 1A – “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n16\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized in\ndrug discovery and development. Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can stimulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (the \"Platform\"), a comprehensive bank\nof unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\nWe also sell Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), an oncology data-driven software program which contains comprehensive\ninformation derived from our research services and clinical studies. Lumin leverages Champions’ large Datacenter coupled with\nanalytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational cancer research. It is the combination of the\nDatacenter and the analytics that create a foundation for Lumin. Insights developed using Lumin can provide the basis for\nbiomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and guide the direction of additional preclinical\nevaluations. During fiscal 2023, we recorded an asset impairment related to Lumin software development costs of $807,000.\nThere were no impairment charges recorded for fiscal 2024.\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our rich and unique Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other\nadvanced computational analytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental\nplatforms to rapidly validate these targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to early\nstage therapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business\nis wide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. Any expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\n17\nFor the Years Ended April 30,\n% of % of %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 50,155 100.0 % $ 53,870 100.0 % (6.9) %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 29,401 58.6 29,532 54.8 (0.4)\nResearch and development 9,544 19.0 11,545 21.4 (17.3)\nSales and marketing 7,064 14.1 7,002 13.0 0.9\nGeneral and administrative 11,067 22.1 10,240 19.0 8.1\nLoss on disposal of equipment 435 0.9 — — 100.0\nAsset Impairment — — 807 1.5 (100.0)\nTotal costs and operating expenses 57,511 114.7 59,126 109.7 (2.7)\nLoss from operations (7,356) (14.7) (5,256) (9.8) 40.0\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from research services, was $50.2 million and $53.9 million, for the\nyears ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $3.7 million, or 6.9%. The decrease in revenue was primarily\ndue to a combination of factors including an increase in study cancellations during fiscal year 2023 and a slowdown of\nbookings expansion. These two factors reduced our net bookings and available convertible revenue in the current year.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services were $29.4 million and $29.5 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a\nslight decrease of $0.1 million or 0.4%. Gross margin was 41% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 compared to 45%\nfor the twelve months ended April 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was the result of relatively unchanged variable costs\non a revenue decline. Variable costs were a higher percentage of revenue due to increases in mice and supply expenses. These\nincreases were caused by operational inefficiencies creating the need for additional mice and lab supplies.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense was $9.5 million and $11.5 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, a decrease of $2.0 million or (17.3)%. The decrease was primarily due to cost cutting measures along with a\nreduction in research and development work required as our newer platforms mature. These factors led to a decline in\ncompensation and lab supply expenses. The decrease was also due to a reduction in spend for our drug discovery and\ndevelopment programs.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense was $7.1 million and $7.0 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nremaining relatively flat with a slight increase of $0.1 million or 0.9%. The increase was mainly due to increased conference\nattendance.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense was $11.1 million and $10.2 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, an increase of $0.8 million, or 8.1%. General and administrative expense was primarily comprised of\ncompensation, insurance, professional fees, IT, and depreciation and amortization expenses. The general and administrative\nexpense increase was primarily due to compensation and recruiting expenses due to the addition to the executive team.\nAdditionally, non-cash stock compensation and allowances for estimated credit losses and bad debt reserves increased. These\nincreases were partially offset by a decrease in IT and professional fees.\n18\nAsset Impairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we assessed the recoverability of the Lumin capitalized software development costs\nby comparing the forecasted future revenues from Lumin sales, based on management’s best estimates and using appropriate\nassumptions and projections, to the carrying amount of the capitalized asset. Several factors were considered in this analysis,\nincluding, the decrease in Lumin revenue growth from the prior year, the deceleration of new Lumin bookings in the current\nyear, and the strategic consideration for additional capital investment into the platform, sales team, and marketing campaigns to\nbolster awareness and growth. As the carrying value was determined not to be recoverable from future revenues, an\nimpairment loss was recognized for the year ending April 30, 2023 equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded\nthe future revenues, or, its net book value at that date of $807,000. There were no impairment charges for the year ending April\n30, 2024.\nLoss on Disposal of Equipment\nLoss on disposal of equipment was $435,000 and zero for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the year\nended April 30, 2024, the loss resulted from the disposal of equipment which could no longer be utilized and had a net book\nvalue, or carrying value on the balance sheet, as of the disposal date.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income, net, was $48,000 for the year ended April 30, 2024. Other expense, net, was $11,000 for the year ended April\n30, 2023. For the year ended April 30, 2024, other income resulted primarily from interest income of $92,000 partially offset by\nforeign currency transaction net losses of approximately $16,000 and interest expense of $28,000. For the year ended April 30,\n2023, other expense, net resulted primarily from foreign currency transaction net losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nUnder ASC Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (“ASC 205-40”), the Company has the\nresponsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial\nobligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The following conditions\nraised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern: a history of net losses, working capital deficits,\naccumulated deficit and declining cash position. Going concern matters are more fully discussed in Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. No adjustments have been made to the financials\nstatements as a result this uncertainty.\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Most recently, we have met these cash requirements\nthrough cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received\nproceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities. For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023,\nthe Company had a net loss of approximately $7.3 million and a net loss of approximately $5.3 million, respectively. While we\nbelieve we have strategies to increase our revenues and reduce our costs which can be implemented without disrupting the\nbusiness or completely restructuring the Company, there can be no assurances. In order to continue to fund our operations we\nmay need to raise additional equity or debt capital in the near term and cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful\nin doing so, and if we can, on whether the terms will be acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing in the\nnear future, we may be required to pursue a reorganization proceeding, including under applicable bankruptcy or insolvency\nlaws.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $6.1 million for the year ended April 30, 2024. Net cash provided by operating\nactivities was $4.0 million for the year ended April 30, 2023. The decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to the net\nloss realized in fiscal 2024.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n19\nNet cash used in investing activities was $836,000 and $2.9 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The cash used was for the investment in lab and computer equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $527,000 for the year ended April 30, 2024. Net cash provided by financing\nactivities was $11,000 for the year ended April 30, 2023. Cash flows used in financing activities was for the repurchase of\ncommon stock per our stock buyback program and financing lease payments and was offset by stock options exercise proceeds.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of\nmanagement’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect\nof matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of\nall of our significant accounting policies, which are more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this document. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. There are also areas in\nwhich the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result.\nGeneral\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial\nstatements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\n(\"GAAP\"). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant\nestimates of the Company include, among other things, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition, valuation\nallowance for deferred tax assets, recoverability of capitalized software development costs, and stock-based compensation and\nwarrant assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience, our observance of trends in particular areas and\ninformation or valuations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which\nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from\nother sources. Actual amounts could differ significantly from amounts previously estimated.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In accordance with (\"ASC 606\"), revenue is now\nrecognized when, or as, a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the\nconsideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services.\nA performance obligation is a promise (or a combination of promises) in a contract to transfer distinct goods or services to\na customer and is the unit of accounting under ASC 606 for the purposes of revenue recognition. A contract's transaction price\nis allocated to each separate performance obligation based upon the standalone selling price and is recognized as revenue,\nwhen, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the Company's contracts have a single performance\nobligation because the promise to transfer individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts,\nand therefore, is not distinct.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract. In addition, in certain instances a customer contract may\ninclude forms of variable consideration such as performance incentives or other provisions that can increase or decrease the\ntransaction price. This variable consideration is generally awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics. For the\npurposes of revenue recognition, variable consideration is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis and the amount to be\nrecorded is estimated based on the assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and consideration of all information\nthat is reasonably available. Variable consideration is recognized as revenue if and when it is deemed probable that a significant\n20\nreversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable\nconsideration is resolved in the future.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract when they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nStock-Based Payments\nWe typically recognize expense for stock-based payments based on the fair value of awards on the date of grant. We use the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value. The option pricing model requires us to estimate certain key\nassumptions such as expected life, volatility, risk free interest rates, and dividend yield to determine the fair value of stock-\nbased awards. These assumptions are based on historical information and management judgment. We expense stock-based\npayments over the period that the awards are expected to vest. In the event of forfeitures, compensation expense is adjusted. We\nreport cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized from those options (excess tax\nbenefits) as financing cash flows when the cash tax benefit is received.\nRecoverability of Capitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. We capitalize certain costs in the development of our\ninternal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and the software has reached the point of technological\nfeasibility. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its\nintended purpose and available for sale. Capitalized costs are recorded as an asset and then amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nCapitalized software development costs are stated at gross cost less accumulated amortization. Recoverability of these\ncapitalized costs is determined at each balance sheet date by comparing the forecasted future revenues from the related product,\nbased on management’s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time, to the carrying amount of the\ncapitalized software development costs. If the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future revenues, an\nimpairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the future revenues. During fiscal\n2023, we recorded an asset impairment charge related to software development costs of $807,000. There were no impairment\ncharges related to software development costs recorded during fiscal 2024.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in\ndetermining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net\ndeferred tax assets. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the\njurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing\ntemporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, depreciation on property, plant and\nequipment, goodwill and losses for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which include\ntax loss carry-forwards, and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood\nthat deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent that recovery is not likely or there is\ninsufficient operating history, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent a valuation allowance is established or\nincreased in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision of the consolidated statements of operations. As\nof April 30, 2024 and 2023, we have established a full valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets.\nAs of April 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions on the balance sheet relative to foreign\noperations in the amount of $181,000. We do not anticipate any significant unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during\nthe next 12 months. Any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in income tax expense. The\nCompany has not accrued any additional penalties or interest during the year ended April 30, 2024 as we believe the liability for\nuncertain tax positions accurately reflects penalties and/or interest as of this date.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\n21\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\". This update requires\nimmediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses. Under the prior model, losses were\nrecognized only as they were incurred. The new model is applicable to all financial instruments that are not accounted for at\nfair value through net income. The Company adopted this ASU on May 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have a material effect\non its condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are\nnot disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee any\nthird-party debt.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe consolidated financial statements required pursuant to this Item are included in Item 15 of this Annual Report and are\npresented beginning on page F-1.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer (our Chief\nExecutive Officer) and Principal Financial Officer (our Chief Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of April 30, 2024, the end of our fiscal year covered by this Annual Report. The term\n“disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and\nforms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or person\nperforming similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating\nthe cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of April 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of April 30,\n2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This rule defines internal control over financial reporting as a\nprocess designed by, or under the supervision of, Company management to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the components established in\nthe Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\n22\nA system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is any deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company’s annual\nor interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nBased upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of April 30, 2024, the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended April 30,\n2024, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position\nof the Company as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of\nthe years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows\nfrom operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to\nthese matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the\noutcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\nto error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over\nfinancial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs described further in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues are primarily derived from contracts with\ncustomers to provide pharmacology services with payments based on fixed fee arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue\nover time using a progress-based input method that depicts the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized for the single performance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work\nperformed to date and the performance does not create an asset with an alternative use. Customer payments may be made in\nadvance or on a schedule in the statement of work (“SOW”) unrelated to when revenue is recognized resulting in deferred\nrevenue. The determination of the progress as the overall performance obligation is being completed is based on the worked\nperformed in accordance with the SOW and requires management estimates. Pharmacology services revenues for the years\nended April 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $47.0 million and $50.7 million, respectively. Pharmacology deferred\nrevenue as of April 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately $12.0 million and $12.7 million, respectively.\nWe identified the accounting for revenue and the related deferred revenue recognized over time as a critical audit matter due to\nthe complexity and subjectivity of management’s estimate of the progress towards completion of its projects. This in turn led to\na high degree of auditor judgement and subjectivity and significant audit effort was required in performing procedures to\nevaluate management’s determination of the project completion progress, related costs incurred and deferred revenue.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the financial statements. We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of controls relating to the\nCompany's revenue recognition and deferred revenue. Our audit procedures related to the recognition of revenue over time and\ndeferred revenue included the following procedures, among others, (i) testing the Company’s estimates of project progress by\nevaluating the appropriate SOW and customer correspondence documentation, (ii) testing the significant assumptions used to\ndevelop the estimates of project progress pursuant to the SOW and (iii) testing completeness and accuracy of the underlying\ndata.\n/s/ EisnerAmper LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.\nEISNERAMPER LLP\nWest Palm Beach, Florida\nJuly 19, 2024\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF APRIL 30\n(In Thousands except for shares)\n2024 2023\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 2,618 $ 10,118\nAccounts receivable, net 9,526 8,011\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,495 1,328\nTotal current assets 13,639 19,457\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 6,252 7,318\nProperty and equipment, net 5,721 7,186\nOther long term assets 185 15\nGoodwill 335 335\nTotal assets $ 26,132 $ 34,311\nLIABILITIES\nAND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 5,800 $ 5,334\nAccrued liabilities 2,160 2,270\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 1,337 1,208\nOther current liabilities 150 145\nDeferred revenue 12,094 12,776\nTotal current liabilities 21,541 21,733\nNon-current portion operating lease liabilities 6,093 7,391\nOther non-current liabilities 401 551\nTotal liabilities $ 28,035 $ 29,675\nStockholders' (deficiency) equity:\nCommon stock, $.001 par value;

Organization and Basis of Presentation\nBackground\nChampions Oncology, Inc. (the “Company”), is engaged in drug discovery and development through data-driven research\nstrategies and innovative pharmacology, biomarker and data platforms. The Company’s TumorGraft Technology Platform is\nan approach to personalizing cancer care based upon the implantation of human tumors in immune-deficient mice. The\nCompany provides a technology platform to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using proprietary TumorGraft\nstudies, which the Company believes may be predictive of how drugs may perform in clinical settings. Utilizing the\nTumorGraft Technology Platform (the \"Platform\"), a comprehensive Bank of unique, well characterized \"Patient Derived\nXenoGrafts\" (PDX) models, the Company offers multiple services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform is\ndesigned to facilitate drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of\nexisting drugs.\nThe Company has four operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited, Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, Champions Oncology S.R.L., and Corellia AI, Inc. For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no\nrevenues earned by these subsidiaries.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company operates in one reportable business segment.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company’s foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in\nearnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s international\noperations.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nSignificant estimates include, among other things, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition, valuation allowance for\ndeferred tax assets, recoverability of capitalized software development costs, and stock-based compensation and warrant\nassumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience, our observance of trends in particular areas and information or\nvaluations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual\namounts could differ significantly from amounts previously estimated.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had cash balances of\n$2.6 million and $10.1 million, respectively, and no cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash balances in three major\nfinancial institutions. The Company regularly monitors the financial stability of these financial institutions and believes that it\nis not exposed to any significant credit risk in its cash. If any liquidity and/or financial stability concerns arise with respect to\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nbanks and financial institutions, either nationally or in specific regions, the Company's ability to access cash or enter into new\nfinancing arrangements may be threatened, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Subtopic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements—\nGoing Concern (“ASC 205-40”), the Company has the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise\nsubstantial doubt about its ability to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial\nstatements are issued. As required under ASC 205-40, management’s evaluation should initially not take into consideration the\npotential mitigating effects of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements\nare issued. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern.\nIn performing this evaluation, we concluded that under the standards of ASC 205-40 the following conditions raised\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern:\n• a history of net losses, including a net loss of $7.3 million for the year ending April 30 2024;\n• cash used in operations of $6.1 million for the year ended April 30, 2024;\n• working capital deficit of $7.9 million as of April 30, 2024; and\n• an accumulated deficit of $84.6 million.\nThe Company's liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the\nlaunch of new products, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Most recently, the Company has met these\ncash requirements through cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, the\nCompany has also received proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities. While the Company\nbelieves it has strategies to increase revenues and reduce costs which can be implemented without disrupting the business or\ncompletely restructuring the Company, there can be no assurances. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital\nor seek to obtain financing, there can be no assurance that management would be successful in raising such capital or obtaining\nsuch financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties.\nFair Value\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued\nliabilities approximate their fair value based on the liquidity or the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value\nhierarchy promulgated by GAAP consists of three levels:\n• Level one — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n• Level two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n• Level three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting\nentity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company\nevaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company has no assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring and/or non-recurring basis during the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and primarily consists of laboratory equipment, furniture and fixtures, computer\nhardware and software, and internally developed software. Assets in progress include equipment or software not yet placed in\nservice. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various assets\nranging from three to seven years. Refer to Footnote 4, \"Property and Equipment\" for a detailed discussion.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") ASC Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC\n842\"). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nrecorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting\nfixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. As the\nCompany's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest\nand reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest\non the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nAmortization expense for the ROU asset associated with its finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term\nof the lease and interest expense associated with its finance lease is recognized on the balance of the lease liability using the\neffective interest method based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nImpairment losses are to be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable or exceeds its fair\nvalue. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a\ncarrying value may not be recoverable. The Company uses estimates of future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a\nlong- lived asset or asset group to determine the recoverability of the asset. These estimates only include the net cash flows\ndirectly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset\ngroup. For the year ending April 30, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $807,000 for its Lumin\nBioinformatics platform (\"Lumin\") resulting from a recoverability analysis performed at that date. The net book value of Lumin\nat April 30, 2023 was zero. The Company did not recognized any impairment losses for the Company’s long-lived assets for the\nyear ending April 30, 2024. Refer to Note 4, \"Property and Equipment\".\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually in connection with the\nannual budgeting and forecast process and also between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill was allocated to below its carrying amount.\nSuch circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors, market conditions, or\nin business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating\ngoodwill for impairment, we may first perform an assessment qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting\nunit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to as a “step zero” approach. Subsequently (if necessary after step zero),\nan entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.\nUnder FASB's Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-02, Topic 350, \"Intangibles—Goodwill and Other\" goodwill\nimpairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company assesses goodwill impairment by reporting unit. Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\") is the only\nreporting unit with remaining goodwill. Judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors,\nmarket conditions and operational performance of the businesses. Future events, including but not limited to continued declines\nin economic activity, loss of contracts or a significant number of customers, or a rapid increase in costs or capital expenditures,\ncould cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill is impaired. For the years ended April 30, 2024\nand 2023, the Company's annual assessment did not result in any impairment indicators.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue represents payments received in advance of products to be delivered or services to be performed. When\nproducts are delivered and/or services are performed, deferred revenue is recognized as earned. Revenue related to deferred\nrevenue is expected to be recognized within one year.\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nOther non-current liabilities represent amounts for uncertain tax positions relating to one of our foreign entities and a\nfinancing lease of laboratory equipment in exchange for a lab supplies purchasing commitment.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services relates primarily to our TOS business unit. TOS costs consist of direct costs related to laboratory\nsupplies, mice purchases, and maintenance costs for studies completed internally as well as charges from Contract Research\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOrganizations for studies handled externally. Indirect costs include salaries and other payroll related costs of compensation for\npersonnel directly engaged in providing TOS products and services. All costs of performing studies in-house are expensed as\nincurred. All costs of performing studies from external sources, are expensed when incurred.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs represent both costs incurred internally for research and development activities, including\npersonnel costs, mice purchases, and maintenance, as well as costs incurred externally to facilitate research activities, such as\ntumor tissue procurement and characterization expenses. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses represent costs incurred to promote the Company’s products offered, including salaries,\nbenefits and related costs of our sales and marketing personnel, and represent costs of advertising and other selling and\nmarketing expenses. All sales and marketing costs, including advertising costs, are expensed as incurred.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock purchase warrants and stock options. Dilutive earnings per share is not presented when it\nwould be antidilutive to do so.\nStock-based Payments\nThe Company typically recognizes expense for stock-based payments based on the fair value of awards on the date of\ngrant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value. The Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully\ntransferable. The option pricing model requires the Company to estimate certain key assumptions such as expected life,\nvolatility, risk free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions are\nbased on historical information and management judgment. The risk-free interest rate used is based on the United States\ntreasury security rate with a term consistent with the expected term of the award at the time of the grant. Since the Company has\nlimited option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the Securities and\nExchange Commission-approved “simplified method” noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 with the\ncontinued use of this method extended under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. Estimated volatility is based\nupon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company does not anticipate paying a dividend, and\ntherefore, no expected dividend yield was used.\nThe Company expenses stock-based payments over the period that the awards are expected to vest. In the event of\nforfeitures, compensation expense is adjusted. The Company expenses modification charges in the period of modification and,\nif required, over the remaining period the awards are expected to vest. The Company will report cash flows resulting from tax\ndeductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized from those options (excess tax benefits) as financing cash flows, if\nthey should arise.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of expenses\nfor financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported amounts in\nthe consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the likelihood\nthat deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the extent that\nrecovery is not likely or there is insufficient operating history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company adjusts the\nvaluation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets will or will not\nbe realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.\nAs of April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company provided a valuation allowance for all net deferred tax assets, as recovery is not\nmore likely than not based on an insufficient history of earnings.\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain the tax position, based on\nits technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest amount of benefit\nthat is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. As of April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has recorded $181,000\nof liabilities related to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany accrued $0 for any additional interest and or penalties on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for\nthe years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as the Company believes its recorded liability for uncertain tax positions\ncovers any potential interest and/or penalties. The Company does not anticipate any significant unrecognized tax benefits to be\nrecorded during the next 12 months. For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a benefit for\nincome taxes of $32,000 and a provision for income taxes of $68,000, respectively. These amounts are mainly attributable to\ntaxable income earned in Israel and Italy relating to transfer pricing, U.S. state net operating loss limitations and, in fiscal 2024,\nnet of a return to provision adjustment in Israel of $95,000.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The objective\nof the standard is to establish a single comprehensive revenue recognition model that is designed to create greater comparability\nof financial statements across industries and jurisdictions. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the\ntransfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled\nin exchange for those goods or services.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is\ntransferred to the customer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the\nCompany is expected to be entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the\nfollowing five steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the\ncontract (promised goods or services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of\nthe product or service for each performance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by\ngovernmental authorities, such as value added taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating\ntransactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms.\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as\nthe Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\". This update required immediate\nrecognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (\"CECL\"). Under the prior model, losses were\nrecognized only as they were incurred. The new model is applicable to all financial instruments that are not accounted for at\nfair value through net income. The Company adopted this ASU on May 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have a material effect\non its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 3. Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nAccounts receivable and unbilled services were as follows (in thousands):\nApril 30, April 30, April 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAccounts receivable $ 4,886 $ 3,843 $ 6,037\nUnbilled services 5,941 4,993 4,106\nTotal accounts receivable and unbilled services 10,827 8,836 10,143\nLess: allowance for doubtful accounts and estimated credit losses (1,301) (825) (630)\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 9,526 $ 8,011 $ 9,513\nDeferred revenue was as follows (in thousands):\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nDeferred revenue $ 12,094 $ 12,776\nDeferred revenue is shown as a current liability on the Company's balance sheet.\nNote 4.

Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $1.7 million and\n$2.1 million for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAs of April 30, 2024 and 2023, property, plant and equipment included gross assets held under finance leases of\n$1.0 million, respectively. Related depreciation expense for these assets was $146,000 and $135,000 for the years\nended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company disposed of lab equipment with a cost of $542,000 and\naccumulated depreciation of $107,000 as of the disposal date, resulting in a loss on disposal of equipment recorded of\n$435,000. There were no disposals and therefore no gain or loss recorded during the year ended April 30, 2023.\nCapitalized software development costs under a hosting arrangement\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC-350\"). We capitalize certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the project\nitself will be completed and the software will perform as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related\nexpenses for employees and costs of third-party consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to these\ninternal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is\nready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades, increased functionality, and enhancements to the\nCompany's internal-use software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance, and minor\nmodifications are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method\nover an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nThe Company capitalized development and implementation costs in accordance with accounting guidance for its\nbioinformatics platform, Lumin. Lumin is the Company's oncology data-driven software program and data tool which operates\nas Software as a Service (SaaS). These capitalized costs represent salaries, including direct payroll-related costs, certain\nsoftware development consultant expenses and molecular sequencing programming costs incurred in the engineering and\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ncoding of the software development. Total capitalized gross asset costs for the Lumin platform that was launched and placed\ninto service were $1.9 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, an impairment loss for Lumin was recognized\nequal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the future net revenues, or, its net book value at April 30, 2023 of\n$807,000. Amortization expense related to this asset was $0 and $630,000 for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nFinance Lease\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained\nas the result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $370,000 at inception through\nDecember 2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase\ncommitment agreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $370,000 was calculated based on an interest\nrate of 3.25%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $75,000 and $72,000 for the years ended\nApril 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest on the related finance lease liability was approximately $6,000 and $8,000 for\nthe years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained\nas the result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $368,000 at inception through\nDecember 2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase\ncommitment agreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $368,000 was calculated based on an interest\nrate of 3.5%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $71,000 and $63,000 for the years ended\nApril 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest on the related finance lease liability was approximately $9,000 and $11,000 for\nthe years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFuture minimum lease payments due each fiscal year as follows (in thousands):\n2025 $ 160\n2026 140\n2027 80\n2028 7\nThereafter —\nTotal undiscounted liabilities 387\nLess: Imputed interest (16)\nPresent value of minimum lease payments $ 371\nNote 5.

These amounts may not exceed\ntheir net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current. Contract liabilities consist of customer payments received in\nadvance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue recognized from the balance at the\nbeginning of the period. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on the balance sheet on a net contract-by-contract basis at\nthe end of each reporting period. Refer to Note 3 for related balances.\nNote 6. Significant Customers\nFor the year ended April 30, 2024, one of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, at 10%. For the\nyear ended April 30, 2023, one of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, at 14%. This was the same\ncustomer for both years.\nAs of April 30, 2024, one customer accounted for 12% of our total accounts receivable balance. As of April 30, 2023, the\nsame customer accounted for 14% of our total accounts receivable balance.\nNote 7. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is not currently party to any legal matters to its knowledge. The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March 2015\nPrivate Placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into PDX models and use in our\nTOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from approximately nil to $30,000 per tumor sample\ndepending on the successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable product. The upfront costs\nare expensed as incurred. In addition, under certain agreements, for a limited period of time, the Company is subject to royalty\npayments if the licensed tumor models are used for sale in our TOS business, ranging from 2% to 20% of the contract\nprice after recouping certain initiation costs. Some of these arrangements also set forth an annual minimum royalty due\nregardless of tumor models used for sale. For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, we have recognized approximately\n$362,000 and $212,000 in expense related to these royalty arrangements, respectively.\nNote 8. Stock-based Payments\nStock-based compensation in the amount of $1.1 million and $864,000 was recognized for years ended April 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. Stock-based compensation costs were recorded as follows (in thousands):\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYear Ended April 30,\n2024 2023\nGeneral and administrative $ 706 $ 505\nSales and marketing 168 192\nResearch and development 21 19\nTOS cost of sales 223 148\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 1,118 $ 864\nThe Company has in place a 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (\"the Plans\"). In general, these plans\nprovide for stock-based compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and non-employees. The plans also provide for\nlimits on the aggregate number of shares that may be granted, the term of grants and the strike price of option awards.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nAs part of the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan\n(“2021 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to grant (i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Incentive Stock\nOptions; (iii) Restricted Stock Awards; and/or (iv) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based compensation) to its\nemployees, directors and non-employees.

The shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market, as permitted under\napplicable rules and regulations, at prevailing market prices. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market\nconditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors.

For the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded a valuation allowance\nof $18.1 million and $16.8 million, respectively. The net changes in the valuation allowance of $1.4 million and $1.3 million\nduring the fiscal years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were mainly due to increases in the deferred tax asset\nrelated to capitalized research expenses and other timing differences. Management continues to assess the realizability of the\ndeferred tax assets at each interim and annual balance sheet date based upon actual and forecasted operating results.\nAs of April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s estimated U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards were approximately\n$38.6 million and $41.3 million, respectively. Net operating losses generated prior to May 1, 2018 have a 20-year carryforward\nand will begin expiring in 2025 for federal and 2031 for state purposes. Losses generated in the fiscal years since the year ended\nApril 30, 2019 may be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance has been recorded against all of these loss\ncarryforwards.\nUnder the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, certain substantial changes in the Company’s ownership may result in a\nlimitation on the amount of net operating losses that may be utilized in future years. During the fiscal year ended April 30,\n2013, approximately $12.0 million of the Company’s net operating losses became subject to limitation under Internal Revenue\nCode Section 382 in connection with an ownership change on January 28, 2013. As a result of the ownership change, the\nCompany’s annual limitation on its use of net operating loss carry-forwards is approximately $432,000.\nThe Company files income tax returns in various jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. As of April 30, 2024, the\nearliest tax year still subject to examination for state purposes is fiscal 2020.

All of the amounts paid to these related parties have been recognized in\nexpense in the period the services were performed within general and administrative expenses.\nNote 12. Leases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are\nclassified as operating or financing leases, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both an operating lease ROU\nasset and operating lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the\nlease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each\nperiod, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the\namortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses, if any, are\nrecorded when incurred. The Company has elected to apply the short-term lease exemption practical expedient for each class of\nunderlying assets and excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes rent\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the lease term for these short-term leases. The Company has determined that no material\nembedded leases exist. Under ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and\nliabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term.\nFor this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As the\nCompany's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOperating Leases\nThe Company currently leases certain office equipment and its office and laboratory facilities under non-cancelable\noperating leases.

STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Organization, Use of Estimates and Basis of Presentation\nChampions Oncology, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating technology\nsolutions to be utilized in drug discovery and development. The Company's research center operates in both regulatory and non-\nregulatory environments and consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental research platforms. Its\npharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and development at lower costs and\nincreased speeds.\nThe Company has four operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited, Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, Champions Oncology, S.R.L. (Italy), and Corellia A.I.. For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024 and\n2023, there were no revenues earned by these subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s functional currency for its foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are\nrecognized in earnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s\ninternational operations.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Certain\ninformation related to the Company’s organization, significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included\nin financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, has\nbeen condensed or omitted. The April 30, 2023 condensed consolidated balance sheet in the accompanying interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements was derived from audited consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies followed\nin the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the\nCompany’s annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, as filed in the Company's Annual\nReport on Form 10-K with the SEC on July 24, 2023 (the \"Annual Report\"). In the opinion of management, these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate when\nread in conjunction with the Company’s 2023 Annual Report. The results of operations for the interim periods are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full fiscal year.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\n8\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2024 the Company had cash equivalents of\napproximately $2.9 million and, as of April 30, 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents.\nThe Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk in the form of its cash deposits held at multiple banking\ninstitutions. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. As\nof January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $3.3 million and $8.7 million in excess of the FDIC\ninsured limit, respectively.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the\nlaunch of new products, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, the Company has met these cash\nrequirements through cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, the Company\nhas also received proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of its securities. For the nine months ended\nJanuary 31, 2024, the Company had a net loss of approximately $7.2 million and cash used in operations of approximately $4.3\nmillion. As of January 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $84.5 million and cash on hand of\napproximately $4.5 million. The Company believes that cash on hand, together with expected cash to be provided from\noperations during fiscal year 2025, are adequate to fund operations through at least 12 months from the filing of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q (this \"Report\"). However, should the Company's revenue expectations not materialize, the Company\nbelieves it has cost reduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the business or restructuring the\nCompany. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that management would be\nsuccessful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nFair Value\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued\nliabilities approximate their fair value based on the liquidity or the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value\nhierarchy promulgated by GAAP consists of three levels:\n•Level one — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n•Level two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n•Level three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity\nand reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company\nevaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. As of January 31, 2024 the Company had assets measured at fair value on a\nrecurring and/or non-recurring basis as follows:\n(in 000s) January 31, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nCash Equivalents:\nMoney market fund 2,854 — —\nTotal $ 2,854 $ — $ —\nAs of January 31, 2024, the Company had no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and/or non-recurring basis.\nAs of April 30, 2023, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and/or non-recurring basis.\n9\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock options.\nAs of January 31, 2024 and 2023, all of the Company's potential common stock is considered anti-dilutive.\nThe following table reflects the total potential share-based instruments outstanding at January 31, 2024 and 2023 including\nthose that could have an effect on the future computation of dilution per common share, had their effect not been anti-dilutive\ndue to the Company's net losses in the related periods:\nJanuary 31,\n2024 2023\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,903,747 1,779,167\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of\nexpenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the\nlikelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the\nextent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient earnings history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company's\nability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be limited if the Company\nhad undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n“IRC”). The Company adjusts the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that\ndeferred tax assets will or will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax\nprovision in the period of change. As of January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, the Company provided a valuation allowance for\nall net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the assets will not be recovered based on an insufficient history of\nearnings.\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain the tax\nposition, based on its technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest\namount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company recorded $181,000 of liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations as of January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany did not recognize interest or penalties on its consolidated statements of operations during the three and nine-month\nperiods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during\nthe next 12 months.\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 was $11,000 and $17,000,\nrespectively. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 was $49,000 and $48,000,\nrespectively. The provision is mainly attributable to taxable income earned in Israel and/or Italy relating to transfer pricing.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606 (\"ASC 606\"),\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or\nservices to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for\nthose goods or services.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company's arrangements are service type contracts that mainly\nhave a duration of less than a year. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is transferred to the\ncustomer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to\nbe entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the following five steps: (1)\n10\nidentification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract (promised goods\nor services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of the product or service for each\nperformance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities, such as value\nadded taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms.\n11\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as the Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13,\n“Financial Instruments—Credit Losses” (Topic 326). This ASU represents a significant change in the current accounting model\nby requiring immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses. Under the prior model, losses\nwere recognized only as they were incurred, which delayed recognition of expected losses that might not yet have met the\nthreshold of being probable. The Company adopted ASU 2016-03 on April 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have any material\neffect on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 3.

The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended\nJanuary 31, 2024 and 2023 was $3.77 and $4.33, respectively.\n15\nThe Company’s stock options activity for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 was as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nDirectors Average Remaining Aggregate\nand Non- Exercise Contractual Intrinsic\nEmployees Employees Total Price Life (Years) Value\nOutstanding, April 30, 2023 1,739,336 36,331 1,775,667 $ 4.80 4.6 $ 2,683,000\nGranted 419,730 — 419,730 6.10 9.7\nExercised (155,449) — (155,449) 2.31\nForfeited (40,750) — (40,750) 6.21\nCanceled (41,285) — (41,285) 4.44\nExpired (54,166) — (54,166) 12.78\nOutstanding, January 31, 2024 1,867,416 36,331 1,903,747 5.04 5.4 $ 3,068,000\nVested and expected to vest as of\nJanuary 31, 2024 1,867,416 36,331 1,903,747 5.04 5.4 $ 3,068,000\nExercisable as of January 31, 2024 1,453,363 3,750 1,457,113 4.63 4.3 $ 3,011,000\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn March 29, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to\nan aggregate of $5.0 million of the Company’s common stock. The share repurchase program is designed in accordance with\nRule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). The shares may be purchased from\ntime to time in the open market, as permitted under applicable rules and regulations, at prevailing market prices. The timing and\namount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The\nprogram does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum number of shares. As of January 31, 2024, the Company had\npurchased approximately 120,300 shares of its common stock, at an average price of $5.73 per share, totaling approximately\n$708,000 and leaving an available balance of approximately $4.3 million authorized by the Board for use in the program as of\nthat date.\nNote 7. Leases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the\ndefinition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a\nright-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate\nimplicit in the lease, if applicable, or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. As the Company's leases do not provide an\nimplicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement\ndate in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments\neach period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and\nthe amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company currently leases certain office equipment and its office and laboratory facilities under non-cancelable\noperating leases. Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the lease\ncommencement date through the scheduled expiration date. Rent expense totaled $454,000 and $475,000 for the three months\nended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Rent expense totaled $1.4 million for both the nine months ended January 31,\n2024 and 2023.

During both the nine months ending January 31, 2024 and\n17\n2023, the Company paid an affiliate of a Board member $27,000 for consulting services unrelated to his duty as a Board\nmember.\nSuch amounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. As of January 31, 2024, $0 was due to this related party.\nNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is not currently party to any legal matters to its knowledge. The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March\n2015 private placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into Patient Derived Xenograft\n(PDX) models and use in our pharmacology TOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from nil to\n$30,000 per tumor sample depending on the successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable\nproduct. The upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, under certain agreements, for a limited period of time, the\nCompany is subject to royalty payments if the licensed tumor models are used for sale in our TOS business, ranging from 2% to\n20% of the contract price after recouping certain initiation costs. Some of these arrangements also set forth an annual minimum\nroyalty due regardless of tumor models used for sale. For the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, we have\nrecognized approximately $114,000 and $21,000, respectively, in expense related to these royalty arrangements. For the nine\nmonths ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, we have recognized approximately $240,000 and $129,000, respectively, in expense\nrelated to these royalty arrangements.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in\nconjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Report and\nour 2023 Annual Report.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Report contains certain “forward-looking statements,” which include information relating to future events, future\nfinancial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment, regulation, and availability of resources. These\nforward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: proposed new programs; expectations that\nregulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,\nor liquidity; statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates, or forecasts as to our business, financial\nand operational results, and future economic performance; and statements of management’s goals and objectives and other\nsimilar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “would,”\n“predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar\nexpressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be\naccurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are\n18\nbased on information available at the time those statements are made or management’s good faith belief as of that time with\nrespect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. Factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in “Risk Factors”\nin Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report, as updated in our subsequent reports filed with the SEC, including any updates\nfound in Part II, Item 1A of this or other reports on Form 10-Q, if any. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-\nlooking statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in\nassumptions, or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required by applicable\nsecurities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make\nadditional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized\nin drug discovery and development. Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can simulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (the \"Platform\"), a comprehensive bank\nof unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\nWe offer Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), an oncology data-driven Software as a Service (SaaS) program. Our Lumin\nsoftware contains comprehensive information derived from our research services and clinical studies. Lumin leverages our large\nDatacenter coupled with analytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational cancer research. Insights\ndeveloped using Lumin can provide the basis for biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance,\nand guide the direction of additional preclinical evaluations.\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other advanced computational\nanalytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental platforms to validate\nthese targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. All expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n19\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, we have met these cash requirements through\ncash, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received proceeds from certain\nprivate placements and public offerings of our securities. For the nine months ended January 31, 2024, the Company had a net\nloss of approximately $7.2 million and cash used in operations of approximately $4.3 million. As of January 31, 2024, the\nCompany had an accumulated deficit of approximately $84.5 million and cash on hand of approximately $4.5 million. We\nbelieve that our cash on hand, together with expected cash flows from operations to be provided for during fiscal 2025, are\nadequate to fund operations through at least 12 months from the filing of this Report. However, should our revenue\nexpectations not materialize, we believe we have cost reduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the\nbusiness or restructuring the Company. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance\nthat management would be successful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended January 31,\n% of % of %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 12,019 100.0 % $ 12,773 100.0 % (5.9) %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 7,849 65.3 7,699 60.3 1.9\nResearch and development 2,186 18.2 3,202 25.1 (31.7)\nSales and marketing 1,797 15.0 1,761 13.8 2.0\nGeneral and administrative 2,764 23.0 2,569 20.1 7.6\nTotal costs and operating expenses 14,596 121.4 15,231 119.3 (4.2)\nLoss from operations $ (2,577) (21.4) % $ (2,458) (19.2) % 4.8 %\nFor the Nine months ended January 31,\n% of % of %\n2024 Revenue 2023 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 36,153 100.0 % $ 40,799 100.0 % (11.4) %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 22,151 61.3 22,194 54.4 (0.2)\nResearch and development 7,494 20.7 8,693 21.3 (13.8)\nSales and marketing 5,288 14.6 5,153 12.6 2.6\nGeneral and administrative 8,305 23.0 7,494 18.4 10.8\nTotal costs and operating expenses 43,238 119.6 43,534 106.7 (0.7)\nLoss from operations $ (7,085) (19.6) $ (2,735) (6.7) % 159.0 %\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from pharmacology studies, was $12.0 million and $12.8 million\nfor the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of $0.8 million or 5.9%. Oncology services\nrevenue was $36.2 million and $40.8 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of\n20\n$4.6 million or 11.4%. The decrease in revenue resulted from an increase in study cancellations during fiscal year 2023, thereby\nreducing our net bookings and available convertible revenue in the current year.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 were $7.8 million and $7.7 million,\nrespectively, an increase of $150,000 or 1.9%. Cost of oncology services for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023\nwere $22.2 million and $22.2 million, respectively, a slight decrease of $43,000 or 0.2%. The net increase in cost of oncology\nservices for the three months ended January 31, 2024 was primarily from an increase in compensation expense and mouse\ncosts. For the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, margins were 34.7% and 39.7%, respectively. For the nine\nmonths ended January 2024 and 2023, margins were 38.7% and 45.6%, respectively. The lower margin for both the three\nmonths and nine months ended January 31, 2024 resulted primarily from a decline in top line revenue against a generally\nunchanged cost base.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 were $2.2 million and $3.2\nmillion, respectively, a decrease of approximately $1.0 million or 31.7%. Research and development expenses for the nine\nmonths ended January 2024 and 2023 were $7.5 million and $8.7 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately $1.2\nmillion or 13.8%. The decrease in both the three and nine month periods was primarily due to a reduction in investment related\nto our target discovery program.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 were $1.8 million and $1.8 million,\nrespectively, a slight increase of $36,000 or 2.0%. Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended January 2024 and\n2023 were $5.3 million and $5.2 million, respectively, an increase of $135,000 or 2.6%. Sales and marketing expenses are\nprimarily comprised of compensation expenses to support business development.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023 were $2.8 million and $2.6\nmillion, respectively, an increase of $195,000, or 7.6%. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended January\n31, 2024 and 2023 were $8.3 million and $7.5 million, respectively, an increase of $811,000, or 10.8%. General and\nadministrative expenses are primarily comprised of compensation, insurance, professional fees, IT and depreciation and\namortization expenses. The increase for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 was primarily from compensation and\nrecruiting expenses and an increase in allowances for credit losses and bad debt reserves.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the nine months ended January 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $4.3 million. The cash used in\noperating activities was primarily due to the loss for the period resulting from lower revenue.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $947,000 and $2.1 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The cash used in investing activities was for the investment in additional lab and computer equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $382,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2024. The cash used was for the\nCompany's stock repurchase program, offset by cash received from stock option exercises.\n21\nFactors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and\nvolatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other\nthings, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates,\nsupply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding resurgences and the emergence of new variants, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine\nand the Middle East. We cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration, or\nmagnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States\nrequires management to apply methodologies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company include, among other\nthings, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition (replacement of licensed tumors), valuation allowance for deferred\ntax assets, valuation of goodwill, and stock-based compensation and warrant assumptions. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. The Company’s critical accounting policies are summarized in our 2023 Annual Report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that\nare not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee\nany third-party debt.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting companies company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to\nprovide the information otherwise required under this Item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIt is management’s responsibility to establish and maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief\nFinancial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this Report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes\nthat any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of\nachieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the\nrelationship between the benefit of desired controls and procedures and the cost of implementing new controls and procedures.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2024.\nBased on that assessment, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2024 at the reasonable assurance level in\nensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. Further, management concluded that our consolidated financial statements in\nthis Report present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of\nthe dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n22\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by\nRule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n23\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nTo the knowledge of our management team, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our\nofficers or directors in their capacity as such, or against any of our property.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAs a smaller reporting company under Rule 12-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include risk factors in this\nReport. However, as of the date of this Report, there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors\npreviously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on\nour results of operations or financial condition. Additional risks could arise that may also affect our business. We may disclose\nchanges to such risk factors or disclose additional risk factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.\nItem 2.

Organization, Use of Estimates and Basis of Presentation\nChampions Oncology, Inc. (the \"Company\") is a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating technology\nsolutions to be utilized in drug discovery and development. The Company's research center operates in both regulatory and non-\nregulatory environments and consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental research platforms. Its\npharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and development at lower costs and\nincreased speeds.\nThe Company has four operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited, Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, Champions Oncology, S.R.L. (Italy), and Corellia A.I.. For the three and six months ended October 31, 2023 and\n2022, there were no revenues earned by these subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s functional currency for its foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are\nrecognized in earnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s\ninternational operations.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Certain\ninformation related to the Company’s organization, significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included\nin financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, has\nbeen condensed or omitted. The April 30, 2023 condensed consolidated balance sheet in the accompanying interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements was derived from audited consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies followed\nin the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the\nCompany’s annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, as filed on Form 10-K with the\nSEC. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all material\nadjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented and\nthe presentations and disclosures herein are adequate when read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended April 30, 2023. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results\nof operations for a full fiscal year.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\n8\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2023 the Company had cash equivalents of\n$3.6 million and, as of April 30, 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents.\nThe Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk in the form of its cash deposits held at multiple banking\ninstitutions. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. As\nof October 31, 2023 and April 30, 2023, the Company had $4.3 million and $8.7 million in excess of the FDIC insured limit,\nrespectively.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the\nlaunch of new products, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, the Company has met these cash\nrequirements through cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, the Company\nhas also received proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of its securities. For the six months ended\nOctober 31, 2023, the Company had a net loss of approximately $4.6 million and cash used in operations of approximately $3.4\nmillion. As of October 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $82.0 million and cash on hand of\napproximately $5.5 million. The Company believes that cash on hand, together with expected cash to be provided from\noperations for the remainder of fiscal year 2024, are adequate to fund operations through at least 12 months from the filing of\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this \"Report\"). However, should the Company's revenue expectations not materialize, the\nCompany believes it has cost reduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the business or restructuring the\nCompany. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that management would be\nsuccessful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nFair Value\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued\nliabilities approximate their fair value based on the liquidity or the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value\nhierarchy promulgated by GAAP consists of three levels:\n•Level one — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n•Level two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n•Level three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity\nand reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company\nevaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. As of October 31, 2023 the Company had assets measured at fair value on a\nrecurring and/or non-recurring basis as follows:\n(in 000s) October 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nCash Equivalents:\nMoney market fund 3,554 — —\nTotal $ 3,554 $ — $ —\nAs of October 31, 2023, the Company had no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and/or non-recurring basis.\nAs of April 30, 2023, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and/or non-recurring basis.\n9\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock options.\nAs of October 31, 2023 and 2022, all of the Company's potential common stock is considered anti-dilutive.\nThe following table reflects the total potential share-based instruments outstanding at October 31, 2023 and 2022 including\nthose that could have an effect on the future computation of dilution per common share, had their effect not been anti-dilutive\ndue to the Company's net losses in the related periods:\nOctober 31,\n2023 2022\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,831,867 1,675,447\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of\nexpenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the\nlikelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the\nextent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient earnings history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company's\nability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be limited if the Company\nhad undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n“IRC”). The Company adjusts the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that\ndeferred tax assets will or will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax\nprovision in the period of change. As of October 31, 2023 and April 30, 2023, the Company provided a valuation allowance for\nall net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the assets will not be recovered based on an insufficient history of\nearnings.\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain the tax\nposition, based on its technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest\namount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company recorded $181,000 of liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations as of October 31, 2023 and April 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany did not recognize interest or penalties on its consolidated statements of operations during the three and six-month\nperiods ended October 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during\nthe next 12 months.\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $11,000 and $14,000,\nrespectively. The provision for income taxes for the six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $39,000 and $31,000,\nrespectively. The provision is mainly attributable to taxable income earned in Israel and/or Italy relating to transfer pricing.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606 (\"ASC 606\"),\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or\nservices to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for\nthose goods or services.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company's arrangements are service type contracts that mainly\nhave a duration of less than a year. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is transferred to the\ncustomer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to\nbe entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the following five steps: (1)\n10\nidentification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract (promised goods\nor services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of the product or service for each\nperformance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities, such as value\nadded taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms.\n11\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as the Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13,\n“Financial Instruments—Credit Losses” (Topic 326). This ASU represents a significant change in the current accounting model\nby requiring immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses. Under the prior model, losses\nwere recognized only as they were incurred, which delayed recognition of expected losses that might not yet have met the\nthreshold of being probable. The Company adopted ASU 2016-03 on April 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have any material\neffect on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 3. Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nAccounts receivable and unbilled services were as follows (in thousands)\nOctober 31,\n2023 April 30, 2023\nAccounts receivable $ 4,780 $ 3,843\nUnbilled services 4,002 4,993\nTotal accounts receivable and unbilled services 8,782 8,836\nLess allowances (1,058) (825)\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 7,724 $ 8,011\nDeferred revenue was as follows (in thousands):\nOctober 31,\n2023 April 30, 2023\nDeferred revenue $ 12,968 $ 12,776\nDeferred revenue is shown as a current liability on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of May 1, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the consolidated balance of net accounts receivable was $8.0 million and\n$9.5 million, respectively, and deferred revenue was $12.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively. As of August 1, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, the consolidated balance of net accounts receivable was $9.0 million and $9.4 million, respectively, and\ndeferred revenue was $11.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively.\nNote 4. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nOncology Services Revenue\nThe following table represents disaggregated revenue for the three and six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nOctober 31, October 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nPharmacology services $ 10,876 $ 13,480 $ 22,735 $ 26,236\nOther TOS revenue 697 731 1,381 1,679\nPersonalized oncology services — 70 18 111\nTotal oncology services revenue $ 11,573 $ 14,281 $ 24,134 $ 28,026\n12\nOther Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\") revenue represents additional services provided to the Company's\npharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, specifically flow cytometry services and software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") provided\nvia our Lumin Bioinformatics software (\"Lumin\").\nContract Balances\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to the\ncustomer for which the right to payment is subject to factors other than the passage of time. These amounts may not exceed\ntheir net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current and included in accounts receivable. Contract liabilities\nconsist of customer payments received in advance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue\nrecognized from the balance at the beginning of the period and included in deferred revenue. Contract assets and liabilities are\npresented on the balance sheet on a net contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nNote 5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and primarily consists of laboratory equipment, computer equipment and\nsoftware, capitalized software development costs, and furniture and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various assets ranging from three to nine years. Property and equipment\nconsisted of the following (table in thousands):\nOctober 31, April 30,\n2023 2023\nFurniture and fixtures $ 246 $ 246\nComputer equipment and software 2,164 2,102\nCapitalized software development costs 1,888 1,888\nLaboratory equipment 11,762 10,390\nAssets in progress 62 1,079\nLeasehold improvements 316 111\nTotal property and equipment 16,438 15,816\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (9,497) (8,630)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 6,941 $ 7,186\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $484,000 and $560,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was $929,000 and $1.1 million for the six months ended October 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $448,000\nand $525,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense,\nexcluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $857,000 and $1.0 million for the six months ended October 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2023 and April 30, 2023, property, plant and equipment included gross assets held under finance leases\nof $1.0 million, respectively. Related depreciation expense was approximately $36,000 and $35,000 for the three months ended\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $72,000 and $64,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs Under a Hosting Arrangement\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC-350\"). We capitalize certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the project\nitself will be completed and the software will perform as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related\nexpenses for employees and costs of third-party consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to these\ninternal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is\n13\nready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades, increased functionality, and enhancements to the\nCompany's internal-use software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance, and minor\nmodifications are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method\nover an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nThe Company has capitalized development and implementation costs in accordance with accounting guidance for its\nLumin platform. Lumin is the Company's oncology data-driven software program and data tool which operates as SaaS. These\ncapitalized costs represent salaries, including direct payroll-related costs, certain software development consultant expenses and\nmolecular sequencing programming costs incurred in the engineering and coding of the software development. Total capitalized\ngross asset costs for the Lumin platform that was launched and placed into service were $1.9 million. During the fourth quarter\nof fiscal year 2023, an impairment loss was recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the future\nnet revenues, or, its net book value at April 30, 2023 of $807,000. Amortization expense related to this asset was $0 and\n$157,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $0 and $314,000 for the six months ended\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFinance Lease\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained as\nthe result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $368,000 at inception through June 2027.\nCash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase commitment\nagreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $368,000 was calculated based on an interest rate of 3.5%.\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $17,600 and $17,000 for the three months ended\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $35,000 and $28,200 for the six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained as\nthe result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $370,000 at inception through December\n2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase commitment\nagreement. At the commencement of the commitment, the present value of the minimum future obligations of $370,000 was\ncalculated based on an interest rate of 3.25%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $18,500\nand $18,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $36,900 and $35,700 for the six months\nended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe liabilities related to these finance leases are classified under other current liability and other non-current liabilities on the\nCompany's balance sheet. The weighted average remaining lease term of these leases is 3.06 years.\nRefer to Note 7, Leases, for information on operating leases.\nNote 6. Share-Based Payments\nStock-based compensation expense was recognized as follows (table in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nOctober 31, October 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nGeneral and administrative $ 31 $ 23 $ 215 $ 146\nSales and marketing 21 49 87 97\nResearch and development 1 4 12 7\nCost of oncology services — 43 162 75\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 53 $ 119 $ 476 $ 325\nThe Company has in place a 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the \"Plans\"). In general,\nthese Plans provide for stock-based compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and non-employees. The Plans also\n14\nprovide for limits on the aggregate number of shares that may be granted, the term of grants and the strike price of option\nawards.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nAs part of the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan\n(“2021 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to grant (i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Incentive Stock\nOptions; (iii) Restricted Stock Awards; and/or (iv) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based compensation) to its\nemployees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2021 Equity Plan shall not exceed 2 million shares of\ncommon stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of grant and the awards vest\nas determined by the Company's Board of Directors. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have a strike price not less than\n100% of the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option or right at the date of grant. As of October 31, 2023,\napproximately 1.4 million shares were available for issue under this plan.\n2010 Equity Incentive Plan\nOn February 18, 2011, shareholders owning a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company executed a written\nconsent approving the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (“2010 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2010 Equity Plan is to grant (i)\nNon-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Restricted Stock Awards; and (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based\ncompensation) to its employees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2010 Equity Plan shall not exceed\n30 million shares of common stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of grant\nand the awards vest as determined by the Board of Directors. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have a strike price not less\nthan 100% of the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option or right at the date of grant. After February 2021,\nno more shares were available to be issued from this plan.\nStock Option Grants\nBlack-Scholes assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the three and six months ended\nOctober 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nOctober 31, October 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nExpected term in\nyears 6 6 6 6\nRisk-free interest\nrates 4.49% 0.00% 3.95% - 4.49% 2.87%\nVolatility 63.30% 0.00% 62.83% - 63.30% 62.58%\nDividend yield —% —% —% —%\nThe weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 was\n$4.02 and $0.00, respectively, as there were no stock options granted during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. The\nweighted average fair value of stock options granted during the six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3.95 and\n$4.50, respectively.\nThe Company’s stock options activity for the six months ended October 31, 2023 was as follows:\n15\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nDirectors Average Remaining Aggregate\nand Non- Exercise Contractual Intrinsic\nEmployees Employees Total Price Life (Years) Value\nOutstanding, April 30, 2023 1,739,336 36,331 1,775,667 $ 4.80 4.6 $ 2,683,000\nGranted 279,100 — 279,100 6.40 9.9\nExercised (155,449) — (155,449) 2.31\nForfeited (32,000) — (32,000) 5.86\nCanceled (34,618) — (34,618) 3.98\nExpired (833) — (833) 15.96\nOutstanding, October 31, 2023 1,795,536 36,331 1,831,867 5.25 4.6 $ 2,685,000\nVested and expected to vest as of\nOctober 31, 2023 1,795,536 36,331 1,831,867 5.25 4.6 $ 2,685,000\nExercisable as of October 31, 2023 1,478,204 1,875 1,480,079 4.91 4.0 $ 2,675,000\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn March 29, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to\nan aggregate of $5.0 million of the Company’s common stock. The share repurchase program is designed in accordance with\nRule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act. The shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market, as permitted\nunder applicable rules and regulations, at prevailing market prices. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on\nmarket conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to\nacquire a minimum number of shares. As of October 31, 2023, the Company had purchased approximately 120,300 shares of its\ncommon stock, at an average price of $5.73 per share, totaling approximately $708,000 and leaving an available balance of\napproximately $4.3 million authorized by the Board for use in the program as of that date.\nNote 7. Leases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the\ndefinition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a\nright-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate\nimplicit in the lease, if applicable, or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. As the Company's leases do not provide an\nimplicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement\ndate in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments\neach period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and\nthe amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company currently leases certain office equipment and its office and laboratory facilities under non-cancelable\noperating leases. Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the lease\ncommencement date through the scheduled expiration date. Rent expense totaled $454,000 and $466,000 for the three months\nended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Rent expense totaled $907,000 and $934,000 for the six months ended October\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company considers its facilities adequate for its current operational needs.\nThe Company leases the following facilities:\n• One University Plaza, Suite 307, Hackensack, New Jersey 07601, which, since November 2011, serves as the Company’s\ncorporate headquarters. The lease expires in November 2026. The Company recognized $19,000 and $21,000 of rent\nexpense relative to this lease for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.The Company recognized\n16\n$38,000 and $42,000 of rent expense relative to this lease for the six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n• 1330 Piccard Drive Suite 025, Rockville, MD 20850, which consists of laboratory and office space where the Company\nconducts operations related to its primary service offerings. The Company executed the original lease in January 2017. The\nlease was amended to expand the premises and extend the expiration date in March 2020 and again in December 2020. The\noperating commencement date was August 11, 2017. This lease expires in February 2029.

The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March\n2015 private placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into Patient Derived Xenograft\n(PDX) models and use in our pharmacology TOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from nil to\n$30,000 per tumor sample depending on the successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable\nproduct. The upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, under certain agreements, for a limited period of time, the\nCompany is subject to royalty payments if the licensed tumor models are used for sale in our TOS business, ranging from 2% to\n20% of the contract price after recouping certain initiation costs. Some of these arrangements also set forth an annual minimum\nroyalty due regardless of tumor models used for sale. For the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, we have\nrecognized approximately $53,200 and $32,000, respectively, in expense related to these royalty arrangements. For the six\nmonths ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized approximately $126,200 and $108,000, respectively, in expense\nrelated to these royalty arrangements.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in\nconjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Report and\nour most recent annual report for the year ended April 30, 2023, as filed on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements,” which include information relating to\nfuture events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment, regulation, and availability of\nresources. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: proposed new programs;\nexpectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,\nresults of operations, or liquidity; statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates, or forecasts as to our\nbusiness, financial and operational results, and future economic performance; and statements of management’s goals and\nobjectives and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “should,”\n“could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”\n“estimates” and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be\naccurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are\nbased on information available at the time those statements are made or management’s good faith belief as of that time with\nrespect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.\n18\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. Factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in “Risk Factors”\nin Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, as updated in our subsequent\nreports filed with the SEC, including any updates found in Part II, Item 1A of this or other reports on Form 10-Q, if any. You\nshould not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking\nstatements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information,\nexcept to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no\ninference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized\nin drug discovery and development. Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can simulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (the \"Platform\"), a comprehensive bank\nof unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\nWe offer Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), an oncology data-driven Software as a Service (SaaS) program. Our Lumin\nsoftware contains comprehensive information derived from our research services and clinical studies. Lumin leverages our large\nDatacenter coupled with analytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational cancer research. Insights\ndeveloped using Lumin can provide the basis for biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance,\nand guide the direction of additional preclinical evaluations.\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other advanced computational\nanalytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental platforms to validate\nthese targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. All expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, we have met these cash requirements through\ncash, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received proceeds from certain\n19\nprivate placements and public offerings of our securities. For the six months ended October 31, 2023, the Company had a net\nloss of approximately $4.6 million and cash used in operations of approximately $3.4 million. As of October 31, 2023, the\nCompany had an accumulated deficit of approximately $82.0 million and cash on hand of approximately $5.5 million. We\nbelieve that our cash on hand, together with expected cash flows from operations to be provided for the remainder of fiscal year\n2024, are adequate to fund operations through at least 12 months from the filing of this Report. However, should our revenue\nexpectations not materialize, we believe we have cost reduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the\nbusiness or restructuring the Company. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance\nthat management would be successful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended October 31,\n% of % of %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 11,573 100.0 % $ 14,281 100.0 % (19.0) %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 6,618 57.2 7,443 52.2 (11.1)\nResearch and development 2,515 21.7 2,604 18.2 (3.4)\nSales and marketing 1,795 15.5 1,700 11.9 5.6\nGeneral and administrative 2,600 22.5 2,527 17.7 2.9\nTotal costs and operating expenses 13,528 116.9 14,274 100.0 (5.2)\nLoss from operations $ (1,955) (16.9) % $ 7 — % (28,028.6) %\nFor the Six months ended October 31,\n% of % of %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 24,134 100.0 % $ 28,026 100.0 % (13.9) %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 14,302 59.3 14,495 51.7 (1.3)\nResearch and development 5,308 22.0 5,491 19.6 (3.3)\nSales and marketing 3,491 14.5 3,392 12.1 2.9\nGeneral and administrative 5,540 23.0 4,925 17.6 12.5\nTotal costs and operating expenses 28,641 118.7 28,303 101.0 1.2\n(Loss) Income from operations $ (4,507) (18.7) $ (277) (1.0) % 1,527.1 %\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from pharmacology studies, was $11.6 million and $14.3 million\nfor the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $2.7 million or 19.0%. Oncology services\nrevenue was $24.1 million and $28.0 million for the six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of\n$3.9 million or 13.9%. The decrease in revenue resulted from an increase in study cancellations during fiscal year 2023, thereby\nreducing our net bookings and available convertible revenue in the current year.\n20\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 were $6.6 million and $7.4 million,\nrespectively, a decrease of $825,000 or 11.1%. Cost of oncology services for the six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022\nwere $14.3 million and $14.5 million, respectively, a decrease of $193,000 or 1.3%. The decrease in cost of oncology services\nfor the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily from a decrease in compensation and supply expenses and\noutsourced lab services. For the six months ended October 31, 2023, the decrease was primarily from a reduction in\ncompensation expense. For the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, margins were 42.8% and 47.9%, respectively.\nFor the six months ended October 2023 and 2022, margins were 40.7% and 48.3%, respectively. The lower margin for both the\nthree months and six months ended October 31, 2023 resulted primarily from a decline in top line revenue against a generally\nunchanged cost base.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 were $2.5 million and $2.6\nmillion, respectively, a slight decrease of approximately $89,000 or 3.4%. Research and development expenses for the six\nmonths ended October 2023 and 2022 were $5.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately $183,000\nor 3.3%. Approximately $2.5 million of the Company’s research and development expenses in the first half of 2024 was\ndirected towards our target discovery program.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.8 million and $1.7 million,\nrespectively, a slight increase of $95,000 or 5.6%. Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended October 2023 and\n2022 were $3.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, a slight increase of $99,000 or 2.9%. Sales and marketing expenses are\nprimarily comprised of compensation expenses to support business development.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 were $2.6 million and $2.5\nmillion, respectively, an increase of $73,000, or 2.9%. General and administrative expenses for the the six months ended\nOctober 2023 and 2022 were $5.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively, an increase of $615,000, or 12.5%. General and\nadministrative expenses are primarily comprised of compensation, insurance, professional fees, IT and depreciation and\namortization expenses. The increase for both the three months and six months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily from\ncompensation and recruiting expenses.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $600,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2023, primarily due from\nincreases in accounts receivable collections and deferred revenue. For the six months ended October 31, 2023, net cash used in\noperating activities was $3.4 million. The cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the loss for the period resulting\nfrom lower revenue.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $821,000 and $1.4 million for the six months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The cash used in investing activities was for the investment in additional lab and computer equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $382,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2023. The cash used was for the\nthe Company's stock repurchase program, offset by cash received from stock option exercises.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\n21\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States\nrequires management to apply methodologies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company include, among other\nthings, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition (replacement of licensed tumors), valuation allowance for deferred\ntax assets, valuation of goodwill, and stock-based compensation and warrant assumptions. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates. The Company’s critical accounting policies are summarized in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nfiled with the SEC on July 24, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that\nare not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee\nany third-party debt.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting companies company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to\nprovide the information otherwise required under this Item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIt is management’s responsibility to establish and maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Our management, with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly Report. In designing and evaluating\nour disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is\nrequired to apply its judgment in evaluating the relationship between the benefit of desired controls and procedures and the cost\nof implementing new controls and procedures.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023. Based\non that assessment, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2023 at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring\nthat information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Further, management concluded that our consolidated\nfinancial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rule\n13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n22\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item; however, the\ndiscussion of our business and operations should be read together with the Risk Factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 24, 2023. Such risks and uncertainties have the potential to\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse\nmanner.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nUse of Proceeds\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn March 29, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to an\naggregate of $5.0 million of the Company’s common stock. The share repurchase program is designed in accordance with Rule\n10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market, as permitted under applicable\nrules and regulations, at prevailing market prices. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions,\nshare price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum\nnumber of shares. As of October 31 2023, the Company had purchased approximately 120,300 shares of its common stock, at\nan average price of $5.73 per share, totaling approximately $708,000 and leaving an available balance of approximately\n$4.3 million authorized by the Board for use in the program as of that date.\nItem 3.

Organization, Use of Estimates and Basis of Presentation\nChampions Oncology, Inc. is a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology\nsolutions to be utilized in drug discovery and development. The Company's research center operates in both regulatory and non-\nregulatory environments and consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental research platforms. Its\npharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and development at lower costs and\nincreased speeds.\nThe Company has four operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited, Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, and Champions Oncology, S.R.L. (Italy), and Corellia A.I.. For the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, there\nwere no revenues earned by these subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in\nearnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s international\noperations.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been\neliminated. Certain information related to the Company’s organization, significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures\nnormally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates, or GAAP, has been condensed or omitted. The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the Company’s annual consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended April 30, 2023, as filed on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows for the periods presented and the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate when read in\nconjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2023. The results of operations for\nthe interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full fiscal year.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\n8\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of July 31, 2023 the Company had cash equivalents of $4.1 million\nand, as of April 30, 2023, the Company had no cash equivalents.\nThe Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk in the form of its cash deposits held at multiple banking\ninstitutions. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. As\nof July 31, 2023 and April 30, 2023, the Company had $4.7 million and $8.7 million in excess of the FDIC insured limit,\nrespectively.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the\nlaunch of new products, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, the Company has met these cash\nrequirements through cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, the Company\nhas also received proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities. For the three months ended\nJuly 31, 2023, the Company had a net loss of approximately $2.6 million and cash used in operations of approximately $4.0\nmillion. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $79.9 million and cash on hand of\napproximately $4.9 million. The Company believes that cash on hand, together with expected cash provided from operations for\nthe remainder of fiscal year 2024, are adequate to fund operations through at least 12 months from the filing of this 10-Q.\nHowever, should the Company's revenue expectations not materialize, the Company believes it has cost reduction strategies that\ncould be implemented without disrupting the business or restructuring the Company. Should the Company be required to raise\nadditional capital, there can be no assurance that management would be successful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to\nus, if at all.\nFair Value\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued\nliabilities approximate their fair value based on the liquidity or the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value\nhierarchy promulgated by GAAP consists of three levels:\n•Level one — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n•Level two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n•Level three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity\nand reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company\nevaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. As of July 31, 2023 the Company had assets measured at fair value on a\nrecurring and/or non-recurring basis of as follows:\n(in 000s) July 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nCash Equivalents:\nCertificate of deposit $ 3,500 $ — $ —\nMoney market fund 580 — —\nTotal $ 4,080 $ — $ —\nAs of July 31, 2023 the Company had no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and/or non-recurring basis. As\nof April 30, 2023, the Company had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and/or non-recurring basis.\n9\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock options.\nAs of July 31, 2023 and 2022, all of the Company's potential common stock is considered anti-dilutive.\nThe following table reflects the total potential share-based instruments outstanding at July 31, 2023 and 2022 including\nthose that could have an effect on the future computation of dilution per common share, had their effect not been anti-dilutive:\nJuly 31,\n2023 2022\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,766,752 1,722,155\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of\nexpenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the\nlikelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the\nextent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient earnings history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company's\nability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be limited if the Company\nhad undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n“IRC”). The Company adjusts the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that\ndeferred tax assets will or will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax\nprovision in the period of change. As of July 31, 2023 and April 30, 2023, the Company provided a valuation allowance for all\nnet deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the assets will not be recovered based on an insufficient history of\nearnings.\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain the tax\nposition, based on its technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest\namount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company recorded $181,000 of liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations as of July 31, 2023 and April 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany did not recognize interest or penalties on its consolidated statements of operations during the three-month periods\nended July 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during the next 12\nmonths.\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was $28,000 and $17,000, respectively,\nmainly attributable to taxable income earned in Israel and/or Italy relating to transfer pricing.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606 (\"ASC 606\"), Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to\ncustomers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or\nservices.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company's arrangements are service type contracts that mainly\nhave a duration of less than a year. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is transferred to the\ncustomer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to\nbe entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the following five steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract (promised goods\nor services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\n10\nobligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of the product or service for each\nperformance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities, such as value\nadded taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms.\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\n11\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as the Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit\nLosses” (Topic 326). This ASU represents a significant change in the current accounting model by requiring immediate\nrecognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses. Under the prior model, losses were recognized only as\nthey were incurred, which delayed recognition of expected losses that might not yet have met the threshold of being probable.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-03 on April 1, 2023 and the adoption did not have any material effect on our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNote 3. Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nAccounts receivable and unbilled services were as follows (in thousands)\nJuly 31, 2023 April 30, 2023\nAccounts receivable $ 5,705 $ 3,843\nUnbilled services 4,229 4,993\nTotal accounts receivable and unbilled services 9,934 8,836\nLess allowances (986) (825)\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 8,948 $ 8,011\nDeferred revenue was as follows (in thousands):\nJuly 31, 2023 April 30, 2023\nDeferred revenue $ 11,142 $ 12,776\nDeferred revenue is shown as a current liability on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of May 1, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the consolidated balance of net accounts receivable was $8.0 million and\n$9.5 million, respectively, and deferred revenue was $12.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively.\nNote 4. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nOncology Services Revenue\nThe following tables represents disaggregated revenue for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2023 2022\nPharmacology services $ 11,860 $ 12,756\nOther TOS revenue 684 948\nPersonalized oncology services 17 41\nTotal oncology services revenue $ 12,561 $ 13,745\nOther Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\") revenue represents additional services provided to the Company's\npharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, specifically flow cytometry services and software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") provided\nvia our Lumin Bioinformatics software (\"Lumin\").\nContract Balances\n12\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to the\ncustomer for which the right to payment is subject to factors other than the passage of time. These amounts may not exceed\ntheir net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current and included in accounts receivable. Contract liabilities\nconsist of customer payments received in advance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue\nrecognized from the balance at the beginning of the period and included in deferred revenue. Contract assets and liabilities are\npresented on the balance sheet on a net contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nNote 5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and primarily consists of laboratory equipment, computer equipment and\nsoftware, capitalized software development costs, and furniture and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various assets ranging from three to nine years. Property and equipment\nconsisted of the following (table in thousands):\nJuly 31, April 30,\n2023 2023\nFurniture and fixtures $ 246 $ 246\nComputer equipment and software 2,131 2,102\nCapitalized software development costs 1,888 1,888\nLaboratory equipment 11,479 10,390\nAssets in progress 388 1,079\nLeasehold improvements 316 111\nTotal property and equipment 16,448 15,816\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (9,075) (8,630)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 7,373 $ 7,186\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $445,000 and $528,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $409,000 and\n$499,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of July 31, 2023 and April 30, 2023, property, plant and equipment included gross assets held under finance leases of\n$1.0 million, respectively. Related depreciation expense was approximately $36,000 and $29,000 for the three months ended\nJuly 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCapitalized software development costs under a hosting arrangement\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC-350\"). We capitalize certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the project\nitself will be completed and the software will perform as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related\nexpenses for employees and costs of third-party consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to these\ninternal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is\nready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades, increased functionality, and enhancements to the\nCompany's internal-use software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance, and minor\nmodifications are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method\nover an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nThe Company has capitalized development and implementation costs in accordance with accounting guidance for its\nLumin platform. Lumin is the Company's oncology data-driven software program and data tool which operates as SaaS. These\ncapitalized costs represent salaries, including direct payroll-related costs, certain software development consultant expenses and\nmolecular sequencing programming costs incurred in the engineering and coding of the software development. Capitalized\ncosts are classified as assets in progress during the development process until development is complete and the asset is available\n13\nfor sale. There are no capitalized software development costs classified as assets in progress as of July 31, 2023 or April 30,\n2023. Total capitalized gross asset costs for the Lumin platform that was launched and placed into service were $1.9 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, an impairment loss was recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying\namount exceeded the future net revenues, or, its net book value at April 30, 2023 of $807,000. Amortization expense related to\nthis asset was $0 and $157,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFinance Lease\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained as\nthe result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $368,000 at inception through June 2027.\nCash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase commitment\nagreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $368,000 was calculated based on an interest rate of 3.5%.\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $17,400 and $11,200 for the three months ended July\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained as\nthe result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $370,000 at inception through December\n2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase commitment\nagreement. At the commencement of the commitment, the present value of the minimum future obligations of $370,000 was\ncalculated based on an interest rate of 3.25%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $18,400\nand $18,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe liabilities related to these finance leases are classified under other current liability and other non-current liabilities on the\nCompany's balance sheet. The weighted average remaining lease term of these leases is 3.3 years.\nRefer to Note 7, Leases, for information on operating leases.\nNote 6. Share-Based Payments\nStock-based compensation expense was recognized as follows (table in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2023 2022\nGeneral and administrative $ 184 $ 123\nSales and marketing 66 48\nResearch and development 11 3\nCost of oncology services 162 32\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 423 $ 206\nThe Company has in place a 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"Plans\"). In general, these Plans\nprovide for stock-based compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and non-employees. The Plans also provide for\nlimits on the aggregate number of shares that may be granted, the term of grants and the strike price of option awards.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nAs part of the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan\n(“2021 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to grant (i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Incentive Stock\nOptions; (iii) Restricted Stock Awards; and/or (iv) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based compensation) to its\nemployees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2021 Equity Plan shall not exceed 2 million shares of\ncommon stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of grant and the awards vest\nas determined by the Board of Directors. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have a strike price not less than 100% of the\nfair market value of the common stock subject to the option or right at the date of grant. As of July 31, 2023, approximately\n1.6 million shares were left to issue under this plan.\n14\n2010 Equity Incentive Plan\nOn February 18, 2011, shareholders owning a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company executed a written\nconsent approving the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (“2010 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2010 Equity Plan is to grant (i)\nNon-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Restricted Stock Awards; and (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based\ncompensation) to its employees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2010 Equity Plan shall not exceed\n30 million shares of common stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of grant\nand the awards vest as determined by the Board of Directors. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have a strike price not less\nthan 100% of the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option or right at the date of grant. After February 2021,\nno more shares were available to be issued from this plan.\nStock Option Grants\nBlack-Scholes assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the three months ended July 31, 2023\nand 2022 were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2023 2022\nExpected term in\nyears 6 6\nRisk-free interest\nrates 3.95% 2.87%\nVolatility 62.83% 62.58%\nDividend yield —% —%\nThe weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3.72\nand $4.50, respectively.\nThe Company’s stock options activity for the three months ended July 31, 2023 was as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nDirectors Average Remaining Aggregate\nand Non- Exercise Contractual Intrinsic\nEmployees Employees Total Price Life (Years) Value\nOutstanding, April 30, 2023 1,739,336 36,331 1,775,667 $ 4.80 4.6 $ 2,683,000\nGranted 68,600 — 68,600 6.11 9.9\nExercised (40,897) — (40,897) 2.90\nForfeited (2,000) — (2,000) 4.18\nCanceled (34,618) — (34,618) 3.98\nExpired — — —\nOutstanding, July 31, 2023 1,730,421 36,331 1,766,752 4.91 4.6 $ 4,254,000\nVested and expected to vest as of\nJuly 31, 2023 1,730,421 36,331 1,766,752 4.91 4.6 $ 4,254,000\nExercisable as of July 31, 2023 1,491,784 1,875 1,493,659 4.62 4.0 $ 4,103,000\nShare Repurchase Program\n15\nOn March 29, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to\nan aggregate of $5.0 million of the Company’s common stock. The share repurchase program is designed in accordance with\nRule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act. The shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market, as permitted\nunder applicable rules and regulations, at prevailing market prices. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on\nmarket conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to\nacquire a minimum number of shares. As of July 31, 2023, the Company had purchased approximately 115,000 shares of its\ncommon stock, at an average price of $5.62 per share, totaling approximately $676,000 and leaving an available balance of\napproximately $4.3 million authorized by the Board for use in the program as of that date.\nNote 7. Leases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") Topic 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as\noperating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease\nliability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease, if applicable, or the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value\nof lease payments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is\namortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset\nresult in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company currently leases certain office equipment and its office and laboratory facilities under non-cancelable\noperating leases. Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the lease\ncommencement date through the scheduled expiration date. Rent expense totaled $453,000 and $467,000 for the three months\nended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company considers its facilities adequate for its current operational needs.\nThe Company leases the following facilities:\n• One University Plaza, Suite 307, Hackensack, New Jersey 07601, which, since November 2011, serves as the Company’s\ncorporate headquarters. The lease expires in November 2026. The Company recognized $19,000 and $21,000 of rent\nexpense relative to this lease for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n• 1330 Piccard Drive Suite 025, Rockville, MD 20850, which consists of laboratory and office space where the Company\nconducts operations related to its primary service offerings. The Company executed the original lease in January 2017. The\nlease was amended to expand the premises and extend the expiration date in March 2020 and again in December 2020. The\noperating commencement date was August 11, 2017. This lease expires in February 2029. The Company recognized\n$423,000 and $422,000 of rent expense relative to this lease for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n• VIA LEONE XIII, 14, Milan, Italy, which consists of laboratory and office space where the Company conducts operations\nrelated to its flow cytometry service offerings. The Company executed separate leases for its laboratory space and office\nspace during fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, the Company executed a new lease to consolidate its office and laboratory\nspace at a new nearby location in Italy. The lease expires October 31, 2028 and it replaces the previous two leases, which\nwere terminated during fiscal year 2023. The Company recognized $13,000 and $23,000 of rent expense relative to these\nleases for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nROU assets and lease liabilities related to our current operating leases are as follows (in thousands):\nJuly 31, 2023 April 30, 2023\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net $ 7,092 $ 7,318\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 1,244 1,208\nNon-current portion of operating lease liabilities 7,107 7,391\nAs of July 31, 2023, the weighted average remaining operating lease term and the weighted average discount rate were 5.47\nyears and 5.87%, respectively.\nFuture minimum lease payments due each fiscal year as follows (in thousands):\n16\n2024 remaining $ 2,144\n2025 2,902\n2026 2,950\n2027 2,916\n2028 2,867\nThereafter 2,392\nTotal undiscounted liabilities 16,171\nLess: Imputed interest (7,820)\nPresent value of minimum lease payments $ 8,351\nRefer to Note 5, Property and Equipment, for information on financing leases.\nNote 8. Related Party Transactions\nRelated party transactions include transactions between the Company and its shareholders, management, or affiliates. The\nfollowing transactions were in the normal course of operations and were measured and recorded at the exchange amount, which\nis the amount of consideration established and agreed to by the parties.\nConsulting Services\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid an affiliate of a board member $9,000 and\n$9,000, respectively, for consulting services unrelated to his duty as a board member.\nAs of July 31, 2023, $0 was due to this related party.\nNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nThe Company is not currently party to any legal matters to its knowledge. The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March\n2015 Private Placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into Patient Derived Xenograft\n(PDX) models and use in our pharmacology TOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from nil to\n$30,000 per tumor sample depending on the successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable\nproduct. The upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, under certain agreements, for a limited period of time, the\nCompany is subject to royalty payments if the licensed tumor models are used for sale in our TOS business, ranging from 2% to\n20% of the contract price after recouping certain initiation costs. Some of these arrangements also set forth an annual minimum\nroyalty due regardless of tumor models used for sale. For the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized\napproximately $73,000 and $76,000, respectively, in expense related to these royalty arrangements.\n17\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in\nconjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report and\nour most recent annual report for the year ended April 30, 2023, as filed on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements,” which include information relating to\nfuture events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment, regulation, and availability of\nresources. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: proposed new programs;\nexpectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,\nresults of operations, or liquidity; statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates, or forecasts as to our\nbusiness, financial and operational results, and future economic performance; and statements of management’s goals and\nobjectives and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “should,”\n“could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”\n“estimates” and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be\naccurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are\nbased on information available at the time those statements are made or management’s good faith belief as of that time with\nrespect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. Factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in “Risk Factors”\nin Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, as updated in our subsequent\nreports filed with the SEC, including any updates found in Part II, Item 1A of this or other reports on Form 10-Q, if any. You\nshould not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking\nstatements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information,\nexcept to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no\ninference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized\nin drug discovery and development. Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can stimulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (the \"Platform\"), a comprehensive bank\nof unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\n18\nWe offer Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), an oncology data-driven Software as a Service (SaaS) program. Our Lumin\nsoftware contains comprehensive information derived from our research services and clinical studies. Lumin leverages our large\nDatacenter coupled with analytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational cancer research. Insights\ndeveloped using Lumin can provide the basis for biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance,\nand guide the direction of additional preclinical evaluations.\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other advanced computational\nanalytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental platforms to validate\nthese targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. All expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, we have met these cash requirements through\ncash, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received proceeds from certain\nprivate placements and public offerings of our securities. For the three months ended July 31, 2023, the Company had a net loss\nof approximately $2.6 million and cash used in operations of approximately $4.0 million. As of July 31, 2023, the Company\nhad an accumulated deficit of approximately $79.9 million and cash on hand of approximately $4.9 million. We believe that our\ncash on hand, together with expected cash flows from operations for the remainder of fiscal year 2024, are adequate to fund\noperations through at least 12 months from the filing of this 10-Q. However, should our revenue expectations not materialize,\nwe believe we have cost reduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the business or restructuring the\nCompany. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that management would be\nsuccessful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended July 31,\n% of % of %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 12,561 100.0 % $ 13,745 100.0 % (8.6) %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 7,684 61.2 7,052 51.3 9.0\nResearch and development 2,793 22.2 2,887 21.0 (3.3)\nSales and marketing 1,696 13.5 1,692 12.3 0.2\nGeneral and administrative 2,940 23.4 2,398 17.4 22.6\nTotal costs and operating expenses 15,113 120.3 14,029 102.0 7.7\nLoss from operations $ (2,552) (20.3) % $ (284) (2.1) % 798.6 %\n19\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from pharmacology studies, was $12.6 million and $13.7 million\nfor the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $1.2 million or 8.6%. The decrease in revenue\nresulted from an increase in study cancellations during the prior year which resulted in lower revenue conversion in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 2024.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 were $7.7 million and $7.1 million,\nrespectively, an increase of $0.6 million or 9.0%. The increase in cost of oncology services was primarily from outsourced lab\nservices. For the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, margins were 38.8% and 48.7%, respectively. The lower margin\nfor the current fiscal year resulted primarily from a higher expense base on lower revenue conversion.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 were $2.8 million and $2.9\nmillion, respectively, a slight decrease of approximately $0.1 million or 3.3%. Approximately $1.2 million of the Company’s\nR&D expense in the first quarter of 2024 was directed towards our target discovery program.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.7 million. Sales and marketing\nexpenses are primarily comprised of compensation and conference expenses to support sales efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 were $2.9 million and $2.4\nmillion, an increase of $542,000, or 22.6%, respectively. General and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of\ncompensation, insurance, professional fees, IT, and depreciation and amortization expenses. The increase was primarily due to\nan increase in bad debt expense and provision for credit losses of approximately $160,000 and non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million for the three months ended July 31, 2023 compared to cash used in\noperations of $195,000 for the three-months ended July 31, 2022. The cash used in operating activities was due to the quarter’s\noperating loss, primarily due to the expected lower revenue conversion, an increase in accounts receivable due to timing\ndifferences in the ordinary course of business, and a decrease in deferred revenue as a result of study cancellations.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $668,000 and $754,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The cash used in investing activities was for the investment in additional lab and computer equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $590,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2023 compared to cash provided by\nfinancing activities of $0 for the three months ended July 31, 2022. Cash was utilized for the Company's stock repurchase\nprogram which was slightly offset by an increase in stock option exercise activity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States\nrequires management to apply methodologies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\n20\nand liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company include, among other\nthings, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition (replacement of licensed tumors), valuation allowance for deferred\ntax assets, valuation of goodwill, and stock compensation and warrant assumptions. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. The Company’s critical accounting policies are summarized in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed\nwith the SEC on July 24, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that\nare not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee\nany third-party debt.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIt is management’s responsibility to establish and maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Our management, with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating\nour disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is\nrequired to apply its judgment in evaluating the relationship between the benefit of desired controls and procedures and the cost\nof implementing new controls and procedures.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2023. Based on\nthat assessment, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 31, 2023 at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Further, management concluded that our consolidated\nfinancial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rule\n13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n21\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item; however, the\ndiscussion of our business and operations should be read together with the Risk Factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 24, 2023. Such risks and uncertainties have the potential to\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, strategies or prospects in a material and adverse\nmanner.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5.

Business\nOverview\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized in\ndrug discovery and development. Our research center operates in both regulatory and non-regulatory environments and consists\nof a comprehensive set of computational and experimental research platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data\nplatforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and development at lower costs and increased speeds.\nAt the core of our research platforms is our unique, proprietary bank of Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models. This\npreeminent bank of PDX models is deployed into advanced in vivo and ex vivo pharmacology platforms, providing an\nenhanced level of insight into therapeutic programs. We currently have approximately 1,500 PDX Models in our TumorBank\nthat we believe reflect the characteristics of patients who enroll in clinical trials (late stage, pretreated and metastatic). This\ncharacteristic of our TumorBank is an important differentiator to other established PDX banks. We implant and expand these\ntumors in mice, which allows for future studies and additional characterization of the tumor. Additional analytical and\npharmacology experimental platforms are also available to augment the information gained from studies performed.\nThe PDX bank is highly characterized at the molecular, phenotypic and pharmacological levels, which provides a\ndifferentiated layer of data for our large oncology dataset (the “Datacenter”). The Datacenter combines our proprietary dataset\nwith other large publicly available datasets. This dataset currently includes approximately 3,500 molecular datasets (genomics,\ntranscriptomics, proteomics, phosphor-proteomics), approximately 3,000 clinical drug responses, approximately 3,500 in vivo\ndrug responses, and the accompanying clinical information on the patients from which they were derived (pre and post tumor\nsample acquisition of drug treatments and responses, age, gender, ethnicity, tumor stage, tumor grade, location of tumor biopsy,\nhistology, etc.) derived from our TumorBank. One unique feature of this proprietary dataset is the fact that it is derived from a\nliving TumorBank. This allows us to continue characterizing the TumorBank over time, and increasing the depth of\ncharacterization of the accumulated data. The combination of the breadth and depth of the TumorBank, and associated\ncharacterization, drives the value of our Datacenter. The Datacenter also includes approximately 20,000 publicly available\ndatasets including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and functional genomics, and patient outcome. This Datacenter\nfacilitates our computational approach to drug discovery and provides the foundation to our Software as a Service (\"SaaS\")\nofferings. Collectively, our computational and experimental research platforms enable a more rapid and precise approach to\ndrug discovery and development.\nThrough our technology platforms, we have designed an ecosystem of business lines consisting of:\n• The sale of research services utilizing our innovative research platforms to biopharmaceutical companies\n• The sale of oncology research Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") tools to cancer research scientists\n• The discovery and development of novel oncology therapeutics\n2\nTranslational Oncology Solutions (TOS) Business\nResearch Services\nOur research services utilize our research center to assist pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with their drug\ndevelopment process. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of experimental oncology drugs or\napproved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can simulate the results of human clinical trials.\nThese studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our TumorBank in mice and testing the\ntherapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that reveal the differences in the genetic\nsignatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not respond. Our studies can be used to\ndetermine which types of cancer, if any, may be inhibited by a drug. The studies can also be used to identify specific sub-\npopulations, often characterized by particular genetic mutations that are differentially sensitive or resistant to a drug or drug\ncombination. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nIncreasing the breadth of the TumorBank is an important strategic effort of the Company. We invest significant research and\ndevelopment resources to increase the number of PDX Models in our TumorBank and add unique and different sub-types of\ncancer that are not historically addressed. This effort also allows us to build highly valuable PDX models derived from patients\nwith resistance to specific therapies or important molecular annotations. We also invest significant resources to increase the\ndepth of characterization of the TumorBank. For each model, this characterization includes phenotypic analysis, molecular\nanalyses, and pharmacologic analysis. This depth of characterization, in an individual tumor basis, is unique and not widely\navailable.\nWe have performed studies for approximately 500 different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies over the past ten\nyears, have a high rate of repeat business, and contract with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies across North\nAmerica, Europe and Asia. Studies are performed in a preclinical non-regulatory environment, as well as a Good Clinical\nRegulatory Practice (GCLP) regulatory environment for clinical evaluation. Typical studies are in the $125,000 price range,\nwith an increasing number of studies in the $250,000 to $500,000 range. Studies performed in a regulatory environment can be\nmuch larger than those performed within a non-regulatory environment. Revenue from this business has grown at an average\nannual growth rate of 23% since 2018 and represents the primary source of our current revenue stream.\nSoftware As A Service (SaaS) Business\nOur SaaS business, launched in fiscal year 2021, is centered around our proprietary software platform and data tool, Lumin\nBioinformatics (\"Lumin”), which contains comprehensive information derived from our research services and clinical studies\nand is sold to customers on an annual subscriptions basis. Our software development teams consist of bioinformatics scientists,\nmathematicians as well as software engineers. Lumin leverages Champions’ large Datacenter coupled with analytics and\nartificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational cancer research. It is the combination of the Datacenter and the\nanalytics that create the foundation for Lumin. Insights developed using Lumin can provide the basis for biomarker hypotheses,\nreveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and guide the direction of additional preclinical evaluations. See Note 4\nto the consolidated financial statements for further discussion as to impairment of Lumin assets in fiscal 2023.\nDrug Discovery and Development Business\nOur nascent drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other advanced computational\nanalytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental platforms to rapidly\nvalidate these targets for further drug development efforts. Our efforts center around three areas of focus:\n1. Targeted therapy with drug conjugates\n2. Immune oncology\n3. Cell therapy\n3\nOur drug discovery and development business is dependent on a dedicated research and development team, made up of\ncomputational and experimental scientists. Importantly, the scientific teams within our Drug Discovery and Development teams\nare appropriately segregated from our other businesses.\nWe have a rich pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nOur sales and marketing efforts are dependent on a dedicated sales force of approximately 31 professionals that sell our\nservices directly to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our research services team is focused on identifying and\nselling studies to new customers as well as increasing our revenue from our existing customer base. We spend significant\nresources in informing our customers and reaching out to new contacts within companies that we currently serve. These efforts\nare aimed at moving our customers along the adoption curve for our research platforms, thereby increasing the number of\nstudies and the average study size. Our success in these efforts is demonstrated by the growing number of customers who have\nincreased their annual spend on our services over the years.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2023, revenues from our products and services totaled approximately $53.8 million, an increase\nof approximately 10% from the previous year.\nOur Current Strategy\nOur strategy is to use our various platform technologies to drive multiple synergistic revenue streams. We continue to build\nupon this with investments in research and development. Our enterprise strategy consists of the following:\n• Establish a global leadership position in oncology research\n• A focus on bringing better drugs to patients faster\n• Leading innovation in oncology research and development platforms\n• Cultivating a solid reputation for the quality of data acquisition and interpretation\n• Collaborations across the global biopharma landscape\n• Profitable growth across all business lines\nOur Growth and Expansion Strategy\nOur strategy is to continue to use our various platform technologies to drive multiple synergistic revenue streams.\nOur strategy for growth has multiple components:\n• Growing our TumorBank: We grow our TumorBank in two ways. First, leverage a medical affairs team that works\nwith a well established clinical network to facilitate access to patients diagnosed with prioritized tumors subtypes.\nSecond, we maintain the ability to utilize our legacy Personalized Oncology Services business to establish novel PDX\nmodels from patients who use this service. The PDX models are then deeply characterized at the phenotypic,\nmolecular, and pharmacologic levels. This data characterization is then added to our DataCenter.\n• Adding new experimental technologies: The fields of oncology research and drug development are evolving rapidly.\nTo keep up with new approaches, we continuously add new technologies to platform. We are currently investing in\ndeveloping additional proprietary pharmacology platforms aimed at enhancing the scientific output and driving\ninnovation in the oncology research sector. We are also investing in the development of sophisticated analytical\nplatforms which allow scientists to derive deeper insights when using our pharmacology platforms. Once these\nexperimental technologies are established they are made available to our research and development and target\ndiscovery teams.\n• Computational power: We have developed sophisticated and innovative computational approaches. We have also\ninvested in the development of novel artificial intelligence, data structures, and analytics. Our goal is to leverage our\nunique Datacenter to establish elegant ways to better understand the molecular dynamics of cancer, and the\ndevelopment novel therapeutics.\n4\nCompetition\nChampions currently competes in three different markets:\nResearch Services: Pharmaceutical companies rely on outsourcing preclinical studies to Clinical Research Organizations\n(\"CROs\"). Competition in this industry is intense and based significantly on scientific, technological, and market forces, which\ninclude the effectiveness of the technology and products and the ability to commercialize technological developments. The\nCompany faces significant competition from other healthcare companies in the United States and abroad. The majority of these\ncompetitors are, and will be, substantially larger than the Company, and have substantially greater resources and operating\nhistories. There can be no assurance that developments by other companies will not render our products or technologies\nobsolete or non-competitive or that we will be able to keep pace with the technological or product developments of our\ncompetitors. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations also\ncompete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific, technical and professional personnel and consultants.\nSaaS: There are two important components of Lumin Bioinformatics: the Datacenter and the Analytics. While we feel our\nDatacenter is unique, there are a large number of publicly available datasets that can be accessed free of charge for\ncomputational research. This publicly available data repertoire is constantly growing as academic labs publish results. We\ncontinue to find ways to differentiate our dataset, however there can be no assurance that developments by other companies or\nacademic institutions in data curation will not render our Datacenter obsolete or non-competitive. The second component of\nLumin Bioinformatics is the data analytics. While there are a minimal number of software solutions that offer the degree of\nanalytics available within Lumin Bioinformatics, the know-how and workflows of these analytics are well established in\nbioinformatics labs across academia and the biopharmaceutical industry. As a result, the barrier to entry for developing a SaaS\ntool leveraging these analytics is relatively low.\nDrug Discovery and Development: Our Drug Discovery and Development business places us in a good position of also\ncompeting against the same customers of our Research Services and/or SaaS businesses: the global biopharmaceutical industry.\nThe global oncology drug market is estimated to be as high as $188B in 2023. Competition in this industry is strong and based\nsignificantly on scientific and technological forces, which rely solely on the effectiveness of therapeutics designed to treat\ncancer. The Company faces significant competition from other biopharmaceutical companies in the United States and abroad.\nThe competitors have a wide range of strategic and operational approaches. Our business strategy is to work with differentiated\ntherapeutic targets and research areas. However, given the intense degree of privacy from our competitors, we cannot guarantee\nthat others within the industry are not also working on these targets. Further, some competitors will operate with no laboratory\nor experimental operations, while others will have varying degrees of laboratory space and experimental capabilities. There can\nbe no assurance that developments by other companies will not render experimental platforms obsolete or non-competitive or\nthat we will be able to keep pace with the technological or product developments of our competitors. These companies, as well\nas academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations also compete with us in recruiting and\nretaining highly qualified scientific, technical and professional personnel and consultants.\nResearch and Development\nFor the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, we spent approximately $11.5 million and $9.4 million, respectively, to further\ndevelop our platforms. We continue to expand our TumorBank via the inclusion of tumor tissue and implanted models through\nresearch collaborations and relationships with hospitals and academic institutions. Our research and development efforts were\nfocused on increasing our understanding of our TumorGraft models, their clinical predictability, improving growth and tumor\ntake rates, and other biological and molecular characteristics of the models. We are investing in developing additional\nproprietary pharmacology platforms aimed at enhancing the scientific output and driving innovation in the oncology research\nsector.\nWe are also investing in the acquisition of sophisticated analytical platforms which allow scientists to derive deeper insights\nwhen using our pharmacology platforms.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe research, development, and marketing of our products, the performance of our legacy POS testing services, and the\noperation of our facilities are generally subject to federal, state, local, or foreign legislation, including licensure of our\nlaboratory located in Rockville, Maryland by the State of Maryland and compliance with federal, state, local or foreign\nlegislation applicable to the use of live animals in scientific testing, research and education.\n5\nThe FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory developed tests such as our legacy POS products, but has\ngenerally not exercised it. The FDA has announced regulatory and guidance initiatives that could increase federal regulation of\nour business. We are subject to federal and international regulations with regard to shipment of hazardous materials, including\nthe Department of Transportation and the International Air Transit Authority. These regulations require interstate, intrastate,\nand foreign shipments comply with applicable labeling, documentation, and training requirements.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of July 15, 2023, we had 230 full-time employees, including 73 with doctoral or other advanced degrees. Of our\nworkforce, 176 employees are engaged in research and development and laboratory operations, 31 employees are engaged in\nsales and marketing, and 23 employees are engaged in finance and administration.\nWe believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified\npersonnel. We continue to seek additions to our science and technical staff, although the competition for such personnel in the\npharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Attracting, developing, and retaining skilled and experienced\nemployees in our industry is crucial to our ability to compete effectively. Our ability to recruit and retain such employees\ndepends on a number of factors, including our corporate culture and work environment, our corporate philosophy, internal\ntalent development and career opportunities, and compensation and benefits.\nNone of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have never\nexperienced a work stoppage and believe our relationship with our employees is good.\nCompany History\nWe were incorporated as a merger and acquisition company under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 4, 1985, under\nthe name “International Group, Inc.” In September 1985, the Company completed a public offering and shortly thereafter\nacquired the world-wide rights to the Champions sports theme restaurant concept and changed its name to “Champions Sports,\nInc.” In 1997, the Company sold its Champions service mark and concept to Marriott International, Inc. and until 2005, was a\nconsultant to Marriott International, Inc. and operated one Champions Sports Bar Restaurant. In January 2007, the Company\nchanged its business direction to focus on biotechnology and subsequently changed its name to Champions Biotechnology, Inc.\nOn May 18, 2007, the Company acquired Biomerk, Inc., at which time we began focusing on our current line of business. In\nApril 2011, the Company changed its name to Champions Oncology, Inc. to reflect the Company's new strategic focus on\ndeveloping advanced technologies to personalize the development and use of oncology drugs.\nAvailable Information\nOur internet website address is www.championsoncology.com. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report.\nThrough our website, we make available, free of charge, access to all reports filed with the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission, or SEC, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our\nCurrent Reports on Form 8-K, our Proxy Statements on Schedules 14A and amendments to those reports, as filed with or\nfurnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we\nelectronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Copies of any materials we file with, or furnish to, the SEC can\nalso be obtained free of charge through the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this Annual\nReport. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known, or\nthose we currently consider insignificant, may also impair our business operations in the future.\nWe historically incurred losses from operating activities, may require significant capital and may never achieve\nsustained profitability.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a net loss of approximately $5.3 million and net income of\n$548,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2023, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $77.3 million,\nnegative working capital of $2.3 million, and a cash balance of $10.1 million. The Company also had cash provided by\noperations of approximately $4.0 million for the twelve months ending April 30, 2023. We believe that our cash on hand,\ntogether with expected cash flows from operations, are adequate to fund our operations through at least August 2024.\n6\nThe amount of our income or losses and liquidity requirements may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-\nquarter and will depend on, among other factors:\n• the cost of continuing to build out our TumorGraft bank;\n• the cost and rate of progress toward growing our technology platforms;\n• the cost and rate of progress toward building our business units;\n• the cost of increasing our research and development;\n• the cost of renting our laboratory and animal testing facilities and payment for associated services;\n• the timing and cost of obtaining and maintaining any necessary regulatory approvals;\n• the cost of expanding and building out our infrastructure; and\n• the cost incurred in hiring and maintaining qualified personnel.\nCurrently, the Company derives revenue primarily from research services, while pursuing efforts to further develop its drug\ndiscovery business units.\nTo become sustainably profitable, we will need to generate revenues to offset our operating costs, including our research and\ndevelopment and general and administrative expenses. We may not achieve or sustain our revenue or profit objectives. If we\nincur losses in the future and/or we are unable to obtain sufficient capital either from operations or externals sources, ultimately,\nwe may have to cease operations.\nIn order to grow revenues, we must invest capital to implement our sales and marketing efforts and to successfully develop\nour technology platforms. Our sales and marketing efforts may never generate significant increases in revenues or achieve\nprofitability and it is possible that we will be required to raise additional capital to continue our operations. If we must devote a\nsubstantial amount of time to raising capital, it will delay our ability to achieve our business goals within the time frames that\nwe now expect, which could increase the amount of capital we need. In addition, the amount of time expended by our\nmanagement on fundraising distracts them from concentrating on our business affairs. If we require additional capital and are\nnot successful in raising the needed capital, we may have to cease operations.\nWe may incur greater costs than anticipated, which could result in sustained losses.\nWe use reasonable efforts to assess and predict the expenses necessary to pursue our business strategies. However,\nimplementing our business strategies may require more employees, capital equipment, supplies or other expenditure items than\nmanagement has predicted. Similarly, the cost of compensating additional management, employees and consultants or other\noperating costs may be more than we estimate, which could result in ongoing and sustained losses.\nWe may not be able to implement our business strategies which could impair our ability to continue operations.\nImplementation of our business strategies will depend in large part on our ability to (i) attract and maintain a significant\nnumber of customers; (ii) effectively provide acceptable services to our customers; (iii) develop and license new products and\ntechnologies; (iv) maintain appropriate internal procedures, policies, and systems; (v) hire, train, and retain skilled employees\nand management; (vi) continue to operate despite increasing competition in our industry; and (vii) establish, develop and\nmaintain our name recognition. Our inability to obtain or maintain any or all these factors could impair our ability to implement\nour business strategies successfully, which could have material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur laboratories are subject to regulation and licensure requirements, and the healthcare industry is highly\nregulated; we may face substantial penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.\nOur research services are performed in laboratories that are subject to state regulation and licensure requirements. Such\nregulation and requirements are subject to change, and may result in additional costs or delays in providing our products to our\ncustomers. In addition, the healthcare industry in general is highly regulated in the United States at both the federal and state\nlevels. We seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, but many of the laws and regulations potentially\napplicable to us are vague or unclear. These laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by an authority in a way that\ncould require us to make changes in our business. We may not be able to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to operate our\nbusiness or sell our products. If we fail to do so, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or fines or lose the\nauthorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third parties. If any of these events\nhappened, they could hurt our business and financial results.\n7\nIf our laboratory facilities are damaged or destroyed, or we have a dispute with one of our landlords, our business\nwould be negatively affected.\nWe currently utilize several office suites where our laboratories are located within one facility in Rockville, Maryland. If this\nfacility was to be significantly damaged or destroyed, we could suffer a loss of our ongoing and future drug studies, as well as\nour TumorBank. In addition, we lease the laboratories from a third party. If we had a dispute with our landlord or otherwise\ncould not utilize our space, it would take time to find and move to a new facility, which could negatively affect our results of\noperations.\nAny health crisis impacting our colony of laboratory mice could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur research services operations depend on having a colony of live mice available. If this population experienced a health\ncrisis, such as a virus or other pathogen, such crisis would affect the success of our existing and future business, as we would\nhave to rebuild the population and repeat current studies.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our products and may need to rely on third parties to successfully\nmarket and sell our products and generate revenues.\nCurrently, we rely on the internet, word of mouth, and a small sales force to market our services. We have to compete with\nother pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life science technology and service companies to recruit, hire, train, and retain\nmarketing and sales personnel. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop in-house sales, and as a\nresult, we may not be able to generate product revenue.\nWe will continue to be dependent upon key employees.\nOur success, currently, is dependent upon the efforts of several full-time key employees, the loss of the services of one or\nmore of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We intend to continue to develop\nour management team and attract and retain qualified personnel in all functional areas to expand and grow our business. This\nmay be difficult in the healthcare industry where competition for skilled personnel is intense.\nBecause our industry is very competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources\nand more experience in research and development, we may not succeed in selling or increasing sales of our products and\ntechnologies.\nWe are engaged in a rapidly changing and highly competitive field. Potential competitors in the United States and abroad are\nnumerous and include providers of clinical research services, most of which have substantially greater capital resources and\nmore experience in research and development capabilities. Furthermore, new companies will likely enter our market from the\nUnited States and abroad, as scientific developments surrounding other pre-clinical and clinical services grow in the\nmultibillion dollar oncology marketplace. Our competitors may succeed in selling their products to our pharmaceutical and\nbiotech customers more effectively than we sell our products. In addition, academic institutions, hospitals, governmental\nagencies, and other public and private research organizations also may conduct similar research, seek patent protection, and\nmay develop and commercially introduce competing products or technologies on their own or through joint ventures. If one or\nmore of our competitors succeeds in developing similar technologies and products that are more effective or successful than any\nof those that we currently sell or will develop, our results of operations will be significantly adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete as effectively.\nIt is important in the healthcare industry to obtain patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products, and\nprocesses. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to obtain, enjoy, and enforce protection for any products we have,\ndevelop or acquire under United States and foreign patent laws and other intellectual property laws, preserve the confidentiality\nof our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Where appropriate, we will seek patent\nprotection for certain aspects of our technology. However, while our TumorGraft Technology Platform is proprietary and\nrequires significant know-how to both initiate and operate, it is not patented. It is, therefore, possible for competitors to develop\nother implantation procedures, or to discover the same procedures utilized by us, that could compete with us in our market.\nIt also is unclear whether efforts to secure our trade secrets will provide useful protection. While we will use reasonable\nefforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary\ninformation to competitors resulting in a loss of protection. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using\nour trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts\n8\noutside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Finally, our competitors may independently\ndevelop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be\nharmed.\nWe rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our\ncompetitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality\nagreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific\ncollaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also seek to enter into confidentiality\nand invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may\nbreach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain\nadequate remedies for such breaches. Our trade secrets may also be obtained by third parties by other means, such as breaches\nof our physical or computer security systems. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret\nis difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the\nUnited States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or\nindependently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it,\nfrom using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or\nindependently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nClaims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could adversely affect\nour financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights.\nPatent applications are maintained in secrecy in the United States and also are maintained in secrecy outside the United States\nuntil the application is published. Accordingly, we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology\ninfringes the patents or patent applications of others. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-\nconsuming and could likely:\n• result in costly litigation;\n• divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n• require us to develop non-infringing technology; or\n• require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nResearch service studies are subject to cancellation based on changes in customer’s development plans.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from studies performed for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to assist in the\ndevelopment of oncology drugs. There are many factors that could result in the change of our customers development plans for\nspecific drugs, including without limitation to their research and development budgets and drug development strategies. These\nchanges could lead to the cancellation or modification of on-going or planned studies. This would have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s revenue growth and profit margin.\nWe face competition in the life science market for computational software and for bioinformatics products.\nThe market for our computational software platform for the life science market is competitive. We currently face competition\nfrom other scientific software providers, larger technology and solutions companies, in-house development by our customers\nand academic and government institutions, and the open-source community. Some of our competitors and potential competitors\nhave longer operating histories in certain segments of our industry than we do and could have greater financial, technical,\nmarketing, research and development, and other resources. We could also face competition from open-source software\ninitiatives, in which developers provide software and intellectual property free over the Internet. In addition, some of our\ncustomers spend significant internal resources in order to develop their own software. There can be no assurance that our\ncurrent or potential competitors will not develop products, services, or technologies that are comparable to, superior to, or\nrender obsolete, the products, services, and technologies we offer. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not adapt\nmore quickly than we do to technological advances and customer demands, thereby increasing such competitors' market share\nrelative to ours. Any material decrease in demand for our technologies or services may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDrug development programs, particularly those in early stages of development, may never be commercialized.\n9\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to select successful product candidates, complete preclinical development\nof these product candidates and advance them to and through clinical trials. Early-stage product candidates in particular require\nsignificant investment in development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory clearances and substantial additional\ninvestment before they can be commercialized, if at all.\nOur research and development programs may not lead to commercially viable products for several reasons, and are subject to\nthe risks and uncertainties associated with drug development. For example, we may fail to identify promising product\ncandidates, our product candidates may fail to be safe and effective in preclinical tests or clinical trials, or we may have\ninadequate financial or other resources to pursue discovery and development efforts for new product candidates. From time to\ntime, we may establish and announce certain development goals for our product candidates and programs. However, given the\ncomplex nature of the drug discovery and development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve\nthese goals. If we are unsuccessful in advancing our research and development programs into clinical testing or in obtaining\nregulatory approval, our long-term business prospects will be harmed.\nImpairment of goodwill or other long term assets may adversely impact future results of operations\nWe have intangible assets, including goodwill and capitalized software development costs, on our balance sheet. During\n2023, we recorded an asset impairment charge related to software development costs of $807,000, reducing the net book value\nto zero. If the future growth and operating results of our business are not as strong as anticipated and/or our market\ncapitalization declines, this could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or recoverability of any\nfuture capitalized software development costs. To the extent any future impairment occurs, the carrying value of our assets will\nbe written down to an implied fair value and an impairment charge will be made to our income from continuing operations.\nSuch an impairment charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the Internal Revenue Code, if a\ncorporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity\nownership over a three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other\npre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that our\n2016 public offering, taken together with our private placements and other transactions that have occurred since then, may have\ntriggered an “ownership change” limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent\nshifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss\ncarry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased\nfuture tax liability to us.\nWe have a limited market for our common stock, which makes our securities very speculative.\nTrading activity in our common stock is and has been limited. As a result, an investor may find it difficult to dispose of, or\nto obtain accurate quotations of the price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that a more active market for our\ncommon stock will develop, or if one should develop, there is no assurance that it will be sustained. This could severely limit\nthe liquidity of our common stock, and would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock\nand on our ability to raise additional capital. Furthermore, like many stocks quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, trading in our\ncommon stock is thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do\nwith our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons\nunrelated to operating performance.\nInvestment in our common stock may be diluted if we issue additional shares in the future.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock, which will reduce shareholders’ percentage ownership and may dilute per\nshare value. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of July 18,\n2023, we had 13,544,228 shares of common stock issued and 13,459,539 outstanding. The future issuance of all or part of the\nremaining authorized common stock would result in substantial dilution in the percentage of the common stock held by existing\nshareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services, acquisitions, or other corporate actions may have the effect of\ndiluting the value of the shares held by existing shareholders, and might have an adverse effect on any market for our common\nstock.\n10\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities in the future, our\nstockholders may experience significant dilution. Sale of additional equity and/or convertible debt securities at prices below\ncertain levels will trigger anti-dilution provisions with respect to certain securities we have previously sold. If additional funds\nare raised through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, lenders under the credit facility or\nholders of these debt securities or preferred stock would likely have rights that are senior to the rights of holders of our common\nstock, and any credit facility or additional securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operation.\nPotential future sales or issuances of our common stock to raise capital, or the perception that such sales could occur,\ncould cause dilution to our current stockholders and the price of our common stock to fall.\nWe have historically supported our operations through the issuance of equity and may continue to do so in the future.\nAlthough we may not be successful in obtaining financing through equity sales on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, any\nsuch sales that do occur could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing holders of our common stock.\nAdditionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities to any new investors,\nor the anticipation of such sales, could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nOur stock price is volatile and therefore investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price\nthey paid for it.\nThe stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility\nthat has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may\nnot be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it. The market price for our common stock may be\ninfluenced by many factors, including:\n• regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n• variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n• changes in the healthcare payment system overseas to the degree we receive revenue from such healthcare systems\noverseas;\n• announcements by us of significant acquisition, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n• sales of significant shares of stock by large investors;\n• intellectual property, product liability, or other litigation against us; and\n• the other key facts described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws and of our contractual agreements contain provisions that could delay\nand discourage takeover attempts and any attempts to replace our current management by stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our contractual agreements could make it difficult for\nor prevent a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our board of directors and management. These provisions\ninclude:\n• requirements that our stockholders comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to\nour board of directors or to place stockholders’ proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of stockholders; and\n• in connection with private placements of our stock in 2011, 2013 and 2015, we covenanted that we would not merge or\nconsolidate with another company unless either the transaction and the trading volume of our stock met certain thresholds\nand qualifications or we obtained the consent of certain of the investors who purchased our stock in those private\nplacements.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and make a takeover more\ndifficult to complete, even if such a transaction were in the stockholders’ interest.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult or delaying\nattempts by others to obtain control of us, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. We also\nare subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit us from engaging in a\n“business combination” with an “interested stockholder” unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner\nand prohibit the voting of shares held by persons acquiring certain numbers of shares without obtaining requisite approval. The\nstatutes have the effect of making it more difficult to effect a change in control of a Delaware company.\nOur management and four significant stockholders collectively own a substantial majority of our common stock.\n11\nCollectively, our officers, our directors and three significant stockholders own or exercise voting and investment control of\napproximately 71% of our outstanding common stock as of July 18, 2023. As a result, investors may be prevented from\naffecting matters involving our company, including:\n• the composition of our board of directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and\npolicies, including the appointment and removal of officers;\n• any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations;\n• our acquisition or disposition of assets; and\n• our corporate financing activities.\nFurthermore, this concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control\nor other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. This significant concentration of share\nownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in\nowning stock in a company that is controlled by a small number of stockholders.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends in the past and have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, which could\ncause the value of our common stock to have a lower value than other similar companies which do pay cash dividends.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not anticipate any cash dividends being paid to\nholders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. While our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and\ncapital needs of the business, it is anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion. As we have no\nplans to issue cash dividends in the future, our common stock could be less desirable to other investors and as a result, the value\nof our common stock may decline, or fail to reach the valuations of other similarly situated companies who have historically\npaid cash dividends in the past.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our\nmarket, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price of our common stock\nand trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts\nmay publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their\nrecommendation regarding our common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our\ncompetitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us was to cease coverage of our\ncompany or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause\nthe price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store information,\nto manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax\nrequirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be\nvulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes outside of our control such as catastrophic events,\nnatural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, employee error or malfeasance, security\nbreaches, computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks,\nphishing, hacking, and other cyberattacks. While we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware\nthat we have experienced a material breach. Cyberattacks are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature and\nare becoming more sophisticated. Additionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the Russia-Ukraine military conflict,\nhas heightened the risk of cyberattacks. While we attempt to continuously monitor and mitigate against cyber risks, we may\nincur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents.\nSophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology\nsystems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems, including cloud-based\nplatforms. In addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer\nsystems to the risk of cyber-attacks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain\nthe proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and\ncollection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. If any of our significant information\ntechnology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve\nthe issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely\naffected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption,\n12\nviolation of data privacy laws and regulations, litigation, and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information.\nAny interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that\nmay have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or elsewhere may adversely affect our\nbusiness and we are unable to predict the potential impact.\nWe are subject to risks related to public health crises such as the global pandemic associated with COVID-19. The global\nspread of COVID-19 resulted in the World Health Organization declaring the outbreak a “pandemic,” or a worldwide spread of\na new disease, in early 2020. This virus eventually spread world wide to most countries, and to all 50 states within the United\nStates. In response, most countries around the world imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings in an\neffort to contain the spread of the virus. Employers worldwide were also required to increase, as much as possible, the capacity\nand arrangement for employees to work remotely. More recently, many of the restrictions and travel bans have been eased or\nlifted completely as global society as a whole works to return to pre-pandemic business and personal practices. Although, to\ndate, these restrictions have not materially impacted our operations, the effect on our business, from the spread of COVID-19\nand the actions implemented by the governments of the United States and elsewhere across the globe, may, once again, worsen\nover time and we are unable to predict the potential impact on our business.\nAny outbreak of contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect\non our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel, pursue partnerships and other\nbusiness transactions, receive shipments of biologic materials, as well as be impacted by the temporary closure of the facilities\nof suppliers. The spread of an infectious disease, like COVID-19, may also result in the inability of our suppliers to deliver\nsupplies to us on a timely basis. In addition, health professionals may reduce staffing and reduce or postpone meetings with\nclients in response to the spread of an infectious disease. Though we have not yet experienced such events, if they would occur,\nthey could result in a period of business disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. However, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have\nnot experienced a material adverse effect on our business nor the need for reduction in our work force; and, currently, we do not\nexpect any material impact on our long-term activity. The extent to which any spread of disease, like that of the COVID-19\npandemic, impacts our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,\nincluding, but not limited to, information which may emerge concerning the spreading and severity of the any infectious\ndiseases, the actions to contain these, or treat their impact.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the effect of prolonged\nperiods of inflation on our customers and suppliers, could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions.\nThese conditions include but are not limited to inflation, rising interest rates, availability of capital markets, energy availability\nand costs (including fuel surcharges), the negative impacts caused by pandemics and public health crises (such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic), negative impacts resulting from the military conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, and the effects of\ngovernmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Impacts of such conditions could be passed on to our business in the\nform of a reduced customer base and/or potential for new bookings due to possible reductions in pharmaceutical and biotech\nindustry-wide spend on research and development and/or economic pressure on our suppliers to pass on increased costs.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Company currently leases its office and laboratory facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. Rent expense for\noperating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the lease commencement date through the\nscheduled expiration date. Rent expenses totaled $1.9 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nCompany considers its facilities adequate for its current operational needs.\nThe Company leases the following facilities:\n13\n• One University Plaza, Suite 307, Hackensack, New Jersey 07601, which, since November 2011, serves as the Company’s\ncorporate headquarters. The lease expires in November 2026. The Company recognized $83,000 and $88,000 of rental\ncosts relative to this lease for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n• 1330 Piccard Drive, Suite 025, Rockville, MD 20850, which consists of laboratory and office space where the Company\nconducts operations related to its primary service offerings.

The Company recognized\n$1.7 million of rental costs relative to this lease for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n• VIA LEONE XIII, 14, Milan, Italy, which consists of laboratory and office space where the Company conducts operations\nrelated to its flow cytometry service offerings. The Company consolidated its lab and office space leases into one lease\nduring fiscal 2023. The lease expires October 31, 2028. The Company recognized $98,000 and $81,000 of rental costs\nrelative to these leases for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nPrincipal Market or Markets\nOur shares of common stock are currently quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CSBR.” Our common\nstock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 21, 2015. Prior to such date, our shares of common stock\nwere traded over-the-counter and quoted on the OTCQB Marketplace.\nThe table below sets forth the high and low bid prices of our common stock, as reported on Nasdaq for the periods shown:\nHigh Low\nFiscal Year Ended April 30, 2023:\nFirst quarter $ 9.53 $ 6.81\nSecond quarter 9.88 6.90\nThird quarter 7.24 3.75\nFourth quarter 5.54 3.95\nHigh Low\nFiscal Year Ended April 30, 2022:\nFirst quarter $ 11.25 $ 8.45\nSecond quarter 11.00 9.23\nThird quarter 10.38 7.60\nFourth quarter 8.93 7.06\nApproximate Number of Holders of Common Stock\nAs of July 18, 2023 there were approximately 1,900 record holders of the Company’s common stock.\nDividends\n14\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors. No\ndividends have been declared or paid with respect to our common stock and no dividends are anticipated to be paid in the\nforeseeable future. Any future decisions as to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors,\nsubject to applicable law.\nRecent Sales by the Company of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nRepurchases of Securities\nOn March 29, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to\nan aggregate of $5.0 million of the Company’s common stock. The share repurchase program is designed in accordance with\nRule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market, as permitted under\napplicable rules and regulations, at prevailing market prices. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market\nconditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire\na minimum number of shares. As of April 30, 2023, the Company had purchased approximately 14,000 shares of its common\nstock, at an average price of $5.11 per share, totaling approximately $74,000 and leaving an available balance of approximately\n$4.9 million authorized by the Board for use in the program as of that date.\nUse of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 6. Reserved\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and the related\nnotes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our\ncurrent expectations, estimates, and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially\nfrom those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including\nthose we discuss under Item 1A – “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized in\ndrug discovery and development. Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can stimulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (\"The Platform\"), a comprehensive\nBank of unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\n15\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\nWe also sell Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), an oncology data-driven software program which contains comprehensive\ninformation derived from our research services and clinical studies. Lumin leverages Champions’ large Datacenter coupled with\nanalytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational cancer research. It is the combination of the\nDatacenter and the analytics that create a unique foundation for Lumin. Insights developed using Lumin can provide the basis\nfor biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, and guide the direction of additional\npreclinical evaluations. During fiscal 2023, we recorded an asset impairment related to Lumin software development costs of\n$807,000.\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our rich and unique Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other\nadvanced computational analytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental\nplatforms to rapidly validate these targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to early\nstage therapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business\nis wide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. Any expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended April 30,\n% of % of %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 53,870 100.0 % $ 49,109 100.0 % 9.7 %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 29,532 54.8 23,632 48.1 25.0\nResearch and development 11,545 21.4 9,374 19.1 23.2\nSales and marketing 7,002 13.0 6,379 13.0 9.8\nGeneral and administrative 10,240 19.0 9,117 18.6 12.3\nAsset Impairment 807 1.5 — — 100.0\nTotal costs and operating expenses 59,126 109.7 48,502 98.8 21.9\n(Loss) income from operations $ (5,256) (9.7) % $ 607 1.2 % (965.9) %\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from research services, was $53.9 million and $49.1 million, for the\nyears ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $4.8 million, or 9.7%. The increase in revenue was primarily\ndue to the expansion of both our platform and product lines creating additional demand for our services, leading to larger\npharmacology study sizes in both our in-vivo and ex-vivo platforms.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services were $29.5 million and $23.6 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an\nincrease of $5.9 million or 25.0%. The increase in cost of oncology services was primarily from an increase in compensation\n16\nand supply expenses. Gross margin was 45% for the twelve months ended April 30, 2023 compared to 52% for the twelve\nmonths ended April 30, 2022. The decrease in gross margin was the result of increasing costs in compensation and supplies to\nsupport revenue growth that didn't materialize as expected.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense was $11.5 million and $9.4 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, an increase of $2.2 million or 23.2%. The increase was primarily due to the investments in new service capabilities\nand our drug discovery and development programs with the increase coming primarily from compensation, lab supply, and\noutsourced discovery expenses.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense was $7.0 million and $6.4 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an\nincrease of $0.6 million or 9.8%. The increase was mainly due to compensation expense, driven by the continued expansion of\nour business development teams, and marketing initiatives, including increased conference attendance due to the easing of\nCovid restrictions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense was $10.2 million and $9.1 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, an increase of $1.1 million, or 12.3%. General and administrative expenses were primarily comprised of\ncompensation, insurance, professional fees, IT, and depreciation and amortization expenses. The general and administrative\nexpenses increase was primarily due to increases in non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses.\nAsset Impairment\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we assessed the recoverability of the Lumin capitalized software development costs\nby comparing the forecasted future revenues from Lumin sales, based on management’s best estimates and using appropriate\nassumptions and projections, to the carrying amount of the capitalized asset. Several factors were considered in this analysis,\nincluding, the decrease in Lumin revenue growth from the prior year, the deceleration of new Lumin bookings in the current\nyear, and the strategic consideration for additional capital investment into the platform, sales team, and marketing campaigns to\nbolster awareness and growth. As the carrying value was determined not to be recoverable from future revenues, an\nimpairment loss was recognized for the year ending April 30, 2023 equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded\nthe future revenues, or, its net book value at that date of $807,000. There were no impairment charges for the year ending April\n30, 2022.\nOther Expense\nOther expense, net was $11,000 and $24,000 for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively and resulted primarily\nfrom foreign currency transaction net losses offset by interest income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. In the past, we have met these cash requirements through\nour cash on hand, working capital management, proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities\nand sales of products and services. For the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a net loss of approximately\n$5.3 million and net income of approximately $548,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2023, the Company had an accumulated\ndeficit of approximately $77.3 million, negative working capital of $2.3 million and cash of $10.1 million. For the twelve\nmonths ended April 30, 2023, the Company realized cash flow from operations of approximately $4.0 million. Despite our\nnegative working capital at this date, we believe that our cash on hand, together with expected cash flows from operations, are\nadequate to fund operations through at least August 2024. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can\nbe no assurance that management would be successful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\n17\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $4.0 million and $6.5 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The decrease in cash provided by operations resulted primarily from the net loss realized in fiscal 2023. Cash\ngenerated from operations in 2023 was primarily due to changes in our working capital accounts in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and an increase in deferred revenue.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.9 million and $2.4 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The cash used was for the investment in lab and computer equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $11,000 and $207,000 for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Cash flows provided by financing activities was due to exercises of stock options and decreased from the prior\nyear due to lower volume of exercises. During fiscal 2023, cash provided by financing was offset by cash used to repurchase\ncommon stock per our stock buyback program.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of\nmanagement’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect\nof matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of\nall of our significant accounting policies, which are more fully described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements included in this document. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated\nby generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for management’s judgment in their application. There are also areas\nin which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result.\nGeneral\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial\nstatements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or\nGAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant\nestimates of the Company include, among other things, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition, valuation\nallowance for deferred tax assets, recoverability of capitalized software development costs, and stock-based compensation and\nwarrant assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience, our observance of trends in particular areas and\ninformation or valuations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which\nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from\nother sources. Actual amounts could differ significantly from amounts previously estimated.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue under the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is now recognized\nwhen, or as, a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to\nwhich the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services.\nA performance obligation is a promise (or a combination of promises) in a contract to transfer distinct goods or services to\na customer and is the unit of accounting under ASC 606 for the purposes of revenue recognition. A contract's transaction price\nis allocated to each separate performance obligation based upon the standalone selling price and is recognized as revenue,\nwhen, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the Company's contracts have a single performance\nobligation because the promise to transfer individual services is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts,\nand therefore, is not distinct.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\n18\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract. In addition, in certain instances a customer contract may\ninclude forms of variable consideration such as performance incentives or other provisions that can increase or decrease the\ntransaction price. This variable consideration is generally awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics. For the\npurposes of revenue recognition, variable consideration is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis and the amount to be\nrecorded is estimated based on the assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and consideration of all information\nthat is reasonably available. Variable consideration is recognized as revenue if and when it is deemed probable that a significant\nreversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable\nconsideration is resolved in the future.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract when they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nStock-Based Payments\nWe typically recognize expense for stock-based payments based on the fair value of awards on the date of grant. We use the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value. The option pricing model requires us to estimate certain key\nassumptions such as expected life, volatility, risk free interest rates, and dividend yield to determine the fair value of stock-\nbased awards. These assumptions are based on historical information and management judgment. We expense stock-based\npayments over the period that the awards are expected to vest. In the event of forfeitures, compensation expense is adjusted. We\nreport cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized from those options (excess tax\nbenefits) as financing cash flows when the cash tax benefit is received.\nRecoverability of Capitalized Software Development Costs\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC-350\"). We capitalize certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and the software has reached the\npoint of technological feasibility. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software\nis ready for its intended purpose and available for sale. Capitalized costs are recorded as an asset and then amortized using the\nstraight-line method over an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nCapitalized software development costs are stated at gross cost less accumulated amortization. Recoverability of these\ncapitalized costs is determined at each balance sheet date by comparing the forecasted future revenues from the related product,\nbased on management’s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time, to the carrying amount of the\ncapitalized software development costs. If the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future revenues, an\nimpairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the future revenues. During fiscal\n2023, we recorded an asset impairment charge related to software development costs of $807,000.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in\ndetermining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net\ndeferred tax assets. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the\njurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing\ntemporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, depreciation on property, plant and\nequipment, goodwill and losses for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which include\ntax loss carry-forwards, and liabilities, which are included within the consolidated balance sheet. We then assess the likelihood\nthat deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent that recovery is not likely or there is\ninsufficient operating history, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent a valuation allowance is established or\nincreased in a period, we include an expense within the tax provision of the consolidated statements of operations. As\nof April 30, 2023 and 2022, we have established a full valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets.\n19\nAs of April 30, 2023 and 2022, we recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions on the balance sheet relative to foreign\noperations in the amount of $181,000. We do not anticipate any significant unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during\nthe next 12 months. Any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in income tax expense. The\nCompany has not accrued penalties or interest during the year ended April 30, 2023 as we believe the liability for uncertain tax\npositions accurately reflects penalties and/or interest as of this date.\nAccounting Pronouncements Being Evaluated\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\". This update requires\nimmediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (\"CECL\"). Under the prior model, losses\nwere recognized only as they were incurred. The new model is applicable to all financial instruments that are not accounted for\nat fair value through net income. The standard is effective May 1, 2023 for the Company. We are currently assessing the\nimpact of this update on our consolidated financial statements but we do not expect the adoption of the pronouncement to have\na material impact on our balance sheet or results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are\nnot disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee any\nthird-party debt.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe consolidated financial statements required pursuant to this item are included in Item 15 of this annual report and are\npresented beginning on page F-1\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer (our Chief\nExecutive Officer) and Principal Financial Officer (our Chief Financial Officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of April 30, 2023, the end of our fiscal year covered by this annual report. The term\n“disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and\nforms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or person\nperforming similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating\nthe cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of April 30, 2023 our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of April 30,\n2023, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n20\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This rule defines internal control over financial reporting as a\nprocess designed by, or under the supervision of, Company management to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the components\nestablished in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission.\nA system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is any deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our company’s annual\nor interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nBased upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of April 30, 2023, the year covered by this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the year ended April 30,\n2023, that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\nItem 9B.

In our\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of\nApril 30, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended,\nin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\nto error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over\nfinancial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs described further in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues are primarily derived from contracts with\ncustomers to provide pharmacology services with payments based on fixed fee arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue\nover time using a progress-based input method that depicts the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized for the single performance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work\nperformed to date and the performance does not create an asset with an alternative use. Customer payments may be made in\nadvance or on a schedule in the statement of work (“SOW”) unrelated to when revenue is recognized resulting in deferred\nrevenue. The determination of the progress as the overall performance obligation is being completed is based on the worked\nperformed in accordance with the SOW and requires management estimates. Pharmacology services revenues for the years\nended April 30, 2023 and 2022 were approximately $50.7 million and $46.8 million, respectively.\nWe identified the accounting for revenue and the related deferred revenue recognized over time as a critical audit matter due to\nthe complexity and subjectivity of management’s estimate of the progress towards completion of its projects. This in turn led to\na high degree of auditor judgement and subjectivity and significant audit effort was required in performing procedures to\nevaluate management’s determination of the project completion progress, related costs incurred and deferred revenue.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the financial statements. We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design of controls relating to the\nCompany's revenue recognition and deferred revenue. Our audit procedures related to the recognition of revenue over time and\ndeferred revenue included the following procedures, among others, (i) testing the Company’s estimates of project progress by\nevaluating the appropriate SOW and customer acceptance documentation, (ii) testing the significant assumptions used to\ndevelop the estimates of project progress pursuant to the SOW and (iii) testing completeness and accuracy of the underlying\ndata.\n/s/ EisnerAmper LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.\nEISNERAMPER LLP\nIselin, New Jersey\nJuly 24, 2023\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF APRIL 30\n(In Thousands except for shares)\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 10,118 $ 9,007\nAccounts receivable, net 8,011 9,513\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,328 1,144\nTotal current assets 19,457 19,664\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 7,318 8,230\nProperty and equipment, net 7,186 7,134\nOther long term assets 15 15\nGoodwill 335 335\nTotal assets $ 34,311 $ 35,378\nLIABILITIES\nAND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 5,334 $ 2,868\nAccrued liabilities 2,270 2,414\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 1,208 1,054\nOther current liabilities 145 72\nDeferred revenue 12,776 11,071\nTotal current liabilities 21,733 17,479\nNon-current portion operating lease liabilities 7,391 8,412\nOther non-current liabilities 551 391\nTotal liabilities $ 29,675 $ 26,282\nStockholders' equity:\nCommon stock, $.001 par value;

Organization and Basis of Presentation\nBackground\nChampions Oncology, Inc. (the “Company”), is engaged in drug discovery and development through data-driven research\nstrategies and innovative pharmacology, biomarker and data platforms. The Company’s TumorGraft Technology Platform is\nan approach to personalizing cancer care based upon the implantation of human tumors in immune-deficient mice. The\nCompany provides a technology platform to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using proprietary TumorGraft\nstudies, which the Company believes may be predictive of how drugs may perform in clinical settings. Utilizing the\nTumorGraft Technology Platform (the \"Platform\"), a comprehensive Bank of unique, well characterized \"Patient Derived\nXenoGrafts\" (PDX) models, the Company offers multiple services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform is\ndesigned to facilitate drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of\nexisting drugs.\nThe Company has three operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited and Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, and Champions Oncology S.R.L. For the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no revenues earned by these\nsubsidiaries.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company operates in one reportable business segment.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company’s foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in\nearnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s international\noperations. Foreign currency balances are translated at each month end to US dollars, and any resulting gain or loss is\nrecognized in our results of operations, as the amounts are not material.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nSignificant estimates include, among other things, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition, valuation allowance for\ndeferred tax assets, recoverability of capitalized software development costs, and stock-based compensation and warrant\nassumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience, our observance of trends in particular areas and information or\nvaluations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual\namounts could differ significantly from amounts previously estimated.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of April 30, 2023 and 2022 the Company had cash balances of\n$10.1 million and $9.0 million, respectively, and no cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash balances in three major\nfinancial institutions. The Company regularly monitors the financial stability of these financial institutions and believes that it\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nis not exposed to any significant credit risk in its cash. However, in March and April 2023, certain U.S. government banking\nregulators took steps to intervene in the operations of certain financial institutions due to liquidity concerns, which caused\ngeneral heightened uncertainties in financial markets. While these events have not had a material direct impact on the\nCompany's operations, if further liquidity and financial stability concerns arise with respect to banks and financial institutions,\neither nationally or in specific regions, the Company's ability to access cash or enter into new financing arrangements may be\nthreatened, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. In the past, we have met these cash requirements through\nour cash on hand, working capital management, proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities,\nand sales of products and services. For the year ended April 30, 2023, the Company had a net loss of approximately $5.3\nmillion, an accumulated deficit of approximately $77.3 million, negative working capital of $2.3 million and cash of $10.1\nmillion. Despite the negative working capital, we believe that our cash on hand, together with expected cash flows from\noperations, are adequate to fund operations through at least August 2024. Should the Company be required to raise additional\ncapital, there can be no assurance that management would be successful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at\nall.\nFair Value\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses, and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued\nliabilities approximate their fair value based on the liquidity or the short-term maturities of these instruments. The fair value\nhierarchy promulgated by GAAP consists of three levels:\n• Level one — Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n• Level two — Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\n• Level three — Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting\nentity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.\nDetermining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The Company\nevaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter. The Company has no assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring and/or non-recurring basis during the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and primarily consists of laboratory equipment, furniture and fixtures, computer\nhardware and software, and internally developed software. Assets in progress include equipment or software not yet placed in\nservice. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various assets\nranging from three to seven years. Refer to Footnote 4, \"Property and Equipment\" for a detailed discussion.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") Topic 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\"). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are\nclassified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use (\"ROU\")\nasset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease\npayments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is\namortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset\nresult in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nImpairment losses are to be recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable or exceeds its fair\nvalue. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a\ncarrying value may not be recoverable. The Company uses estimates of future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a\nlong- lived asset or asset group to determine the recoverability of the asset. These estimates only include the net cash flows\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ndirectly associated with, and that are expected to arise as a direct result of, the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset\ngroup. The Company has recognized an impairment loss of $807,000 for its Lumin Bioinformatics platform (\"Lumin\") for the\nyear ending April 30, 2023 resulting from a recoverability analysis performed at that date. The net book value of Lumin at April\n30, 2023 is zero. Refer to Note 4, \"Property and Equipment\". The Company did not recognized any impairment losses for the\nCompany’s long-lived assets for the year ending April 30, 2022.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually in connection with the\nannual budgeting and forecast process and also between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill was allocated to below its carrying amount.\nSuch circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors, market conditions, or\nin business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, or (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. When evaluating\ngoodwill for impairment, we may first perform an assessment qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting\nunit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, referred to as a “step zero” approach. Subsequently (if necessary after step zero),\nan entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.\nUnder FASB's Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-02, Topic 350, \"Intangibles—Goodwill and Other\" goodwill\nimpairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe impairment evaluation test involves comparing the current fair value of each business unit to its carrying value, including\ngoodwill. Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, which requires the Company to estimate the\nfuture cash flows anticipated to be generated by the business unit being tested for impairment as well as to select a risk-adjusted\ndiscount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows. When determining future cash flow estimates, the\nCompany considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions. The Company estimates\ncash flows for the business unit over a discrete period (typically four or five years) and the terminal period (considering\nexpected long term growth rates and trends). Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by management in such\nareas as future economic conditions, industry-specific conditions, product pricing, and necessary capital expenditures. The use\nof different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows or significant changes in risk-adjusted discount rates due to changes\nin market conditions could produce substantially different estimates of the fair value of the business unit.\nThe Company has one reportable segment. The Company assesses goodwill impairment by business unit. Judgments\nregarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and operational performance of\nthe businesses. Future events, including but not limited to continued declines in economic activity, loss of contracts or a\nsignificant number of customers, or a rapid increase in costs or capital expenditures, could cause us to conclude that impairment\nindicators exist and that goodwill is impaired. For the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company's annual assessment\ndid not result in any impairment indicators.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue represents payments received in advance of products to be delivered or services to be performed. When\nproducts are delivered and/or services are performed, deferred revenue is recognized as earned. Deferred revenue is expected to\nbe recognized within one year.\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nOther non-current liabilities represent amounts for uncertain tax positions relating to one of our foreign entities and a\nfinancing lease of laboratory equipment in exchange for a lab supplies purchasing commitment.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services relates primarily to our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\") business unit. TOS costs consist\nof direct costs related to laboratory supplies, mice purchases, and maintenance costs for studies completed internally as well as\ncharges from Contract Research Organization's for studies handled externally. Indirect costs include salaries and other payroll\nrelated costs of compensation for personnel directly engaged in providing TOS products and services. All costs of performing\nstudies in-house are expensed as incurred. All costs of performing studies from external sources, are expensed when incurred.\nResearch and Development\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nResearch and development costs represent both costs incurred internally for research and development activities, including\npersonnel costs, mice purchases, and maintenance, as well as costs incurred externally to facilitate research activities, such as\ntumor tissue procurement and characterization expenses. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses represent costs incurred to promote the Company’s products offered, including salaries,\nbenefits and related costs of our sales and marketing personnel, and represent costs of advertising and other selling and\nmarketing expenses. All sales and marketing costs, including advertising costs, are expensed as incurred.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock purchase warrants and stock options. Dilutive earnings per share is not presented when it\nwould be antidilutive to do so.\nStock-based Payments\nThe Company typically recognizes expense for stock-based payments based on the fair value of awards on the date of\ngrant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value. The Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short-traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully\ntransferable. The option pricing model requires the Company to estimate certain key assumptions such as expected life,\nvolatility, risk free interest rates and dividend yield to determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions are\nbased on historical information and management judgment. The risk-free interest rate used is based on the United States\ntreasury security rate with a term consistent with the expected term of the award at the time of the grant. Since the Company has\nlimited option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the Securities and\nExchange Commission-approved “simplified method” noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 with the\ncontinued use of this method extended under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110. Estimated volatility is based\nupon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company does not anticipate paying a dividend, and\ntherefore, no expected dividend yield was used.\nThe Company expenses stock-based payments over the period that the awards are expected to vest. In the event of\nforfeitures, compensation expense is adjusted. The Company expenses modification charges in the period of modification and,\nif required, over the remaining period the awards are expected to vest. The Company will report cash flows resulting from tax\ndeductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized from those options (excess tax benefits) as financing cash flows, if\nthey should arise.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of expenses\nfor financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported amounts in\nthe consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the likelihood\nthat deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the extent that\nrecovery is not likely or there is insufficient operating history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company adjusts the\nvaluation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets will or will not\nbe realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change.\nAs of April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company provided a valuation allowance for all net deferred tax assets, as recovery is not\nmore likely than not based on an insufficient history of earnings.\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that we will be able to sustain the tax position, based on\nits technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest amount of benefit\nthat is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. As of April 30, 2023 and 2022 the Company has recorded $181,000\nof liabilities related to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany accrued $0 for interest and penalties on the Company’s statement of operations for the years ended April 30, 2023\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nand 2022, respectively as the Company believes its recorded liability for uncertain tax positions covers any potential interest\nand/or penalties. . The Company does not anticipate any significant unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded during the next 12\nmonths. For the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $68,000 and\n$35,000, respectively. These amounts are mainly attributable to taxable income earned in Israel relating to transfer pricing and,\nin fiscal 2023, state net operating loss limitations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\". The objective\nof the standard is to establish a single comprehensive revenue recognition model that is designed to create greater comparability\nof financial statements across industries and jurisdictions. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the\ntransfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled\nin exchange for those goods or services.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is\ntransferred to the customer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the\nCompany is expected to be entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the\nfollowing five steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the\ncontract (promised goods or services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of\nthe product or service for each performance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by\ngovernmental authorities, such as value added taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating\ntransactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms.\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet as\nthe Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nAccounting Pronouncements Being Evaluated\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\". This update requires immediate\nrecognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (\"CECL\"). Under the prior model, losses were\nrecognized only as they were incurred. The new model is applicable to all financial instruments that are not accounted for at\nfair value through net income. The standard is effective May 1, 2023 for the Company. The Company is currently assessing the\nimpact of this update on its consolidated financial statements but does not expect the adoption of the pronouncement to have a\nmaterial impact on its balance sheet or results of operations.\nNote 3.

Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $2.1 million and\n$1.5 million for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of April 30, 2023 and 2022, property, plant and equipment included gross assets held under finance leases of\n$1.0 million and $713,000, respectively. Related depreciation expense for these assets was $135,000 and $87,000 for the years\nended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCapitalized software development costs under a hosting arrangement\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC-350\"). We capitalize certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the project\nitself will be completed and the software will perform as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related\nexpenses for employees and costs of third-party consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to these\ninternal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is\nready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades, increased functionality, and enhancements to the\nCompany's internal-use software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance, and minor\nmodifications are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method\nover an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nThe Company has capitalized development and implementation costs in accordance with accounting guidance for its\nbioinformatics platform, Lumin. Lumin is the Company's oncology data-driven software program and data tool which is\noperates as Software as a Service (SaaS). These capitalized costs represent salaries, including direct payroll-related costs,\ncertain software development consultant expenses and molecular sequencing programming costs incurred in the engineering\nand coding of the software development. Capitalized costs are classified as assets in progress during the development process\nuntil development is complete and the asset is available for sale. There are no capitalized software development costs classified\nas assets in progress as of April 30 2023 or 2022. The total cost capitalized gross asset investment for the Lumin platform that\nwas launched and placed into service was $1.9 million. Ordinary amortization expense related to this asset addition was\n$630,000 and $317,000 for the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company assessed the recoverability of the Lumin capitalized software\ndevelopment costs by comparing the forecasted future revenues from Lumin sales, based on management’s best estimates and\nusing appropriate assumptions and projections, to the carrying amount of the capitalized asset. The Company considered several\nfactors in this analysis including the decrease in Lumin revenue growth from the prior year, the deceleration of new Lumin\nbookings in the current year, and the strategic consideration for additional capital investment into the platform, sales team, and\nmarketing campaigns to bolster awareness and growth. As the carrying value was determined not to be recoverable from future\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nrevenues, an impairment loss was recognized for the year ending April 30, 2023 equal to the amount by which the carrying\namount exceeded the future revenues, or, its net book value at that date of $807,000.\nFinance Lease\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained\nas the result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $370,000 at inception through\nDecember 2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase\ncommitment agreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $370,000 was calculated based on an interest\nrate of 3.25%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $72,000 and $87,000 for the years ended\nApril 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained\nas the result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $368,000 at inception through\nDecember 2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase\ncommitment agreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $368,000 was calculated based on an interest\nrate of 3.5%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $63,000 and zero for the years ended\nApril 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 5.

These amounts may not exceed\ntheir net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current. Contract liabilities consist of customer payments received in\nadvance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue recognized from the balance at the\nbeginning of the period. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on the balance sheet on a net contract-by-contract basis at\nthe end of each reporting period. Refer to Note 3 for related balances.\nNote 6. Significant Customers\nFor the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, one of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, at 14%\nand 13%, respectively.\nAs of April 30, 2023, one customer accounted for 14% of our total accounts receivable balance.

The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March 2015\nPrivate Placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into PDX models and use in our\nTOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from approximately nil to $30,000 per tumor sample\ndepending on the successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable product. The upfront costs\nare expensed as incurred. In addition, under certain agreements, for a limited period of time, the Company is subject to royalty\npayments if the licensed tumor models are used for sale in our TOS business, ranging from 2% to 20% of the contract\nprice after recouping certain initiation costs. Some of these arrangements also set forth an annual minimum royalty due\nregardless of tumor models used for sale. For the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized approximately\n$212,000 and $401,000 in expense related to these royalty arrangements, respectively.\nNote 8. Stock-based Payments\nStock-based compensation in the amount of $864,000 and $912,000 was recognized for years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Stock-based compensation costs were recorded as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended April 30,\n2023 2022\nGeneral and administrative $ 505 $ 563\nSales and marketing 192 189\nResearch and development 19 18\nTOS cost of sales 148 142\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 864 $ 912\nThe Company has in place a 2021 Equity Incentive Plan, 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (\"the\nPlans\"). In general, these plans provide for stock-based compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and non-\nemployees. The plans also provide for limits on the aggregate number of shares that may be granted, the term of grants and the\nstrike price of option awards.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nAs part of the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan\n(“2021 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to grant (i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Incentive Stock\nOptions; (iii) Restricted Stock Awards; and/or (iv) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based compensation) to its\nemployees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2021 Equity Plan shall not exceed 2 million shares of\ncommon stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of grant and the awards vest\nas determined by the Board of Directors. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have a strike price not less than 100% of the\nfair market value of the common stock subject to the option or right at the date of grant. As of April 30, 2023, approximately\n1.7 million shares were left to issue under this plan.\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n2010 Equity Incentive Plan\nOn February 18, 2011, shareholders owning a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company executed a\nwritten consent approving the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (“2010 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2010 Equity Plan is to grant\n(i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Restricted Stock Awards; and (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based\ncompensation) to its employees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2010 Equity Plan shall not exceed\n30,000,000 shares of common stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of\ngrant and the awards vest as determined by the Board of Directors. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have a strike price\nnot less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock subject to the option or right at the date of grant. After\nFebruary 2021, no more shares were available to be issued from this plan.\n2008 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe Company has previously granted (i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Restricted Stock Awards; and (iii) Stock\nAppreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based compensation) to its employees, directors and non-employees under a 2008\nEquity Incentive Plan (the “2008 Equity Plan”). Such awards may be granted by the Company’s Board of Directors. Options\ngranted under the 2008 Equity Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant and the awards vest as determined by\nthe Board of Directors.\nFor stock-based payments to non-employee consultants under the Plans, the fair value of the stock-based consideration issued\nis used to measure the transaction, as management believes this to be a more reliable measure of fair value than the services\nreceived. The fair value of the award is expensed over the period service is provided to the Company; however, it is ultimately\nmeasured at the price of the Company’s common stock or the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation\nmodel on the date that the commitment for performance by the non-employee consultant has been reached or performance is\ncomplete, which is generally the vesting date of the award. After 2018, no more shares were available to be issued from this\nplan.\nDirector Compensation Plan\nOn December 12, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted changes to the\nDirector Compensation Plan of 2010 (the “Director Plan”) effective December 1, 2013. Under the Director Plan, independent\ndirectors of the Company were entitled to an annual award of a five-year option to purchase 8,333 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock, and the Chairman of the Board of the Company was entitled to an annual award of a five-year option to\npurchase 16,667 shares of the Company’s common stock. Independent directors who serve as chairperson of a committee were\nalso to receive an annual grant of a five-year option to purchase 1,667 shares of the Company’s common stock. During fiscal\nyear 2021, the plan was modified to an annual base compensation of $100,000 for each Board Director which could be taken in\neither company options or a combination of company options and cash, not to exceed $35,000. The Chairman of the Board’s\nannual compensation was set at an equivalent of $150,000. Compensation for Independent Directors who serve as chairperson\nof a committee was set at an equivalent of between $110,000 to $120,000. All options issued under the Director Plan vest\nquarterly at a rate of 25%. Option grants will typically be issued after the annual shareholder meeting which will generally be\nheld in October of each year. New directors will receive compensation upon joining the Board equal to a pro-rata equivalent for\nthe remainder of the year. Options issued under the Director Plan are now issued pursuant to the 2021 Equity Plan.\nStock Option Grants\nBlack-Scholes assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022\nwere as follows:\nYear Ended April 30,\n2023 2022\nExpected term in years 6 6\nRisk-free interest rates 2.9% - 3.9% 0.8% - 1.2%\nVolatility 61% - 63% 64% - 66%\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nThe weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, was $4.31 and\n$5.56, respectively.

Earnings Per Share\nA reconciliation of net income and number of shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share was as follows:\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nYear Ended April 30,\n2023 2022\nBasic and diluted net income (loss) per share computation (dollars in thousands):\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ (5,335) $ 548\nWeighted Average common shares - basic 13,541,559 13,197,170\nBasic net income (loss) per share $ (0.39) $ 0.04\nDiluted income (loss) per share computation\nNet income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ (5,335) $ 548\nIncome (loss) available to common stockholders $ (5,335) $ 548\nWeighted Average common shares 13,541,559 13,197,170\nIncremental shares from assumed exercise of warrants and stock options — 962,629\nAdjusted weighted average share – diluted 13,541,559 14,159,799\nDiluted net income (loss) per share $ (0.39) $ 0.04\nThe following table reflects the total potential stock-based instruments outstanding at April 30, 2023 and 2022 that could\nhave an effect on the future computation of dilution per common share. These figures were not included in the above\ncalculation as, to do so, would be antidilutive:\nYear Ended April 30\n2023 2022\nStock options 1,775,667 1,658,239\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,775,667 1,658,239\nNote 11. Related Party Transactions\nRelated party transactions include transactions between the Company and its shareholders, management, or affiliates. The\nfollowing transactions were in the normal course of operations and were measured at the exchange amount, which is the amount\nof consideration established and agreed to by the parties.\nConsulting Services\nFor both years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid a member of its Board of Directors $36,000 for consulting\nservices unrelated to his duties as a board member. During the years ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid another\nboard member zero and $5,500, respectively, for consulting services unrelated to his duties as a board member. All of the\namounts paid to these related parties have been recognized in expense in the period the services were performed.\nNote 12. Leases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are\nclassified as operating or financing leases, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both an operating lease ROU\nasset and operating lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the\nlease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each\nperiod, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the\namortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses, if any, are\nrecorded when incurred. The Company has elected to apply the short-term lease exemption practical expedient for each class of\nunderlying assets and excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less. The Company recognizes rent\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the lease term for these short-term leases. The Company has determined that no material\nCHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nembedded leases exist. Under ASC 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. ROU assets and\nliabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term.\nFor this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As the\nCompany's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company currently leases certain office equipment and its office and laboratory facilities under non-cancelable\noperating leases. Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term from the lease\ncommencement date through the scheduled expiration date. Rent expenses totaled $1.9 million for each the years ended\nApril 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company leases the following facilities:\n• One University Plaza, Suite 307, Hackensack, New Jersey 07601, which, since November 2011, serves as the Company’s\ncorporate headquarters. The lease expires in November 2026. The Company recognized $83,000 and $88,000 of rent\nexpense relative to this lease for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n• 1330 Piccard Drive Suite 025, Rockville, MD 20850, which consists of laboratory and office space where the Company\nconducts operations related to its primary service offerings. The Company executed the original lease in January 2017. The\nlease was amended to expand the premises and extend the expiration date in March 2020 and again in December 2020.\nThe operating commencement date was August 11, 2017. This lease expires in February 2029. The Company recognized\n$1.7 million of rent expense for both fiscal 2023 and 2022.\n• VIA LEONE XIII, 14, Milan, Italy, which consists of laboratory and office space where the Company conducts operations\nrelated to its flow cytometry service offerings. The Company executed separate leases for its laboratory space and office\nspace during fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, the Company executed a new lease to consolidate its office and laboratory\nspace at a new nearby location in Italy. The lease expires October 31, 2028 and it replaces the previous two leases, which\nwere terminated. Upon new lease execution, the Company recognized an operating ROU asset and related operating lease\nliability for the lab and office space of $231,000 each, respectively. Upon termination of the office space lease, the\nCompany recognized a reduction in the related net operating ROU asset and operating lease liability of approximately\n$41,000. Upon termination of the laboratory space lease, the Company recognized a reduction in the related net operating\nROU asset and operating lease liability of approximately $20,000. The Company recognized $98,000 and $81,000 of rent\nexpense associated with the leases in Italy for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nROU assets and lease liabilities related to our current

Organization, Use of Estimates and Basis of Presentation\nChampions Oncology, Inc. is a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology\nsolutions to be utilized in drug discovery and development. The Company's research center operates in both regulatory and non-\nregulatory environments and consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental research platforms. Its\npharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and development at lower costs and\nincreased speeds.\nThe Company has three operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited, Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, and Champions Oncology, S.R.L. (Italy). For the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, there were\nno revenues earned by these subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in\nearnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s international\noperations.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been\neliminated. Certain information related to the Company’s organization, significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures\nnormally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates, or GAAP, has been condensed or omitted. The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the Company’s annual consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended April 30, 2022, as filed on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows for the periods presented and the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate when read in\nconjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022. The results of operations for\nthe interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full fiscal year.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\n8\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022 the Company had no cash\nequivalents.\nThe Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk in the form of its cash deposits held at multiple banking\ninstitutions. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. As\nof January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company had $10.9 million and $8.3 million in excess of the FDIC insured limit,\nrespectively.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the\nlaunch of new products, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, the Company has met these cash\nrequirements through cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, the Company\nhas also received proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities. For the nine months ended\nJanuary 31, 2023, the Company had a net loss of approximately $2.8 million and cash provided by operations of $4.7 million.\nAs of January 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $74.8 million and cash on hand of $11.6\nmillion. The Company believes that cash on hand, together with expected cash provided from operations for fiscal year 2023,\nare adequate to fund operations through at least 12 months from the filing of this 10-Q. However, should the Company's\nrevenue expectations not materialize, the Company believes it has cost reduction strategies that could be implemented without\ndisrupting the business or restructuring the Company. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can be\nno assurance that management would be successful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") Topic 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as\noperating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease\nliability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease, if applicable, or the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value\nof lease payments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is\namortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset\nresult in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock options.\n9\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJanuary 31, January 31,\n(Dollars in Thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022\nBasic net income (loss) per share computation:\nNet income (loss) attributable to common\nstockholders $ (2,439) $ 787 $ (2,774) $ 892\nWeighted Average common shares – basic 13,558,642 13,500,444 13,532,990 13,170,880\nBasic net income (loss) per share $ (0.18) $ 0.06 $ (0.20) $ 0.07\nDiluted net income (loss) per share computation:\nNet income (loss) attributable to common\nstockholders $ (2,439) $ 787 $ (2,774) $ 892\nWeighted Average common shares 13,558,642 13,500,444 13,532,990 13,170,880\nIncremental shares from assumed exercise of stock\noptions — 886,565 — 1,007,202\nAdjusted weighted average share – diluted 13,558,642 14,387,009 13,532,990 14,178,082\nDiluted net income (loss) per share $ (0.18) $ 0.05 $ (0.20) $ 0.06\nThe following table reflects the total potential share-based instruments outstanding at January 31, 2023 and 2022 including\nthose that could have an effect on the future computation of dilution per common share, had their effect not been anti-dilutive:\nJanuary 31,\n2023 2022\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,779,167 1,681,448\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of\nexpenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the\nlikelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the\nextent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient earnings history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company's\nability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be limited if the Company\nhad undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n“IRC”). The Company adjusts the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that\ndeferred tax assets will or will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax\nprovision in the period of change. As of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, the Company provided a valuation allowance for\nall net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the assets will not be recovered based on an insufficient history of\nearnings.\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain the tax\nposition, based on its technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest\namount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company recorded $181,000 of liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations as of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany did not recognize interest or penalties on its consolidated statements of operations during the three or nine-month\nperiods ended January 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during\nthe next 12 months.\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $17,000 and $11,000,\nrespectively. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 was $48,000 and $37,000,\nrespectively. The provision is attributable to taxable income earned in Israel and/or Italy relating to transfer pricing.\nRevenue Recognition\n10\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The objective of\nthe standard is to establish a single comprehensive revenue recognition model that is designed to create greater comparability of\nfinancial statements across industries and jurisdictions. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the transfer\nof goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in\nexchange for those goods or services.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company's arrangements are service type contracts that mainly\nhave a duration of less than a year. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is transferred to the\ncustomer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to\nbe entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the following five steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract (promised goods\nor services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of the product or service for each\nperformance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities, such as value\nadded taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\n11\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms.\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as the Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nAccounting Pronouncements Being Evaluated\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit\nLosses\". This update requires immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (\"CECL\").\nUnder the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred. The new model is applicable to all financial\ninstruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including accounts receivable. The standard is effective\nfor the fiscal year beginning May 1, 2023 for the Company. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on\nour consolidated financial statements and does not anticipate a significant impact.\nNote 3. Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nAccounts receivable and unbilled services were as follows (in thousands)\nJanuary 31,\n2023 April 30, 2022\nAccounts receivable $ 5,051 $ 6,037\nUnbilled services 3,715 4,106\nTotal accounts receivable and unbilled services 8,766 10,143\nLess allowance for doubtful accounts (713) (630)\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 8,053 $ 9,513\nDeferred revenue was as follows (in thousands):\nJanuary 31,\n2023 April 30, 2022\nDeferred revenue $ 13,158 $ 11,071\nDeferred revenue is shown as a current liability on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 4. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nOncology Services Revenue\nThe following tables represents disaggregated revenue for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022:\n12\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJanuary 31, January 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nPharmacology services $ 12,119 $ 12,622 $ 38,355 $ 34,468\nOther TOS revenue 648 546 2,328 1,715\nPersonalized oncology services 6 25 116 49\nTotal oncology services revenue $ 12,773 $ 13,193 $ 40,799 $ 36,232\nOther Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\") revenue represents additional services provided to the Company's\npharmaceutical and biotechnology customers, specifically flow cytometry services and software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") provided\nvia our Lumin Bioinformatics software (\"Lumin\").\nContract Balances\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to the\ncustomer for which the right to payment is subject to factors other than the passage of time. These amounts may not exceed\ntheir net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current and included in accounts receivable. Contract liabilities\nconsist of customer payments received in advance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue\nrecognized from the balance at the beginning of the period and included in deferred revenue. Contract assets and liabilities are\npresented on the balance sheet on a net contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nNote 5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and primarily consists of laboratory equipment, computer equipment and\nsoftware, capitalized software development costs, and furniture and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various assets ranging from three to nine years. Property and equipment\nconsisted of the following (table in thousands):\nJanuary 31, April 30,\n2023 2022\nFurniture and fixtures $ 246 $ 246\nComputer equipment and software 1,990 1,667\nCapitalized software development costs 1,888 1,888\nLaboratory equipment 10,257 8,618\nAssets in progress 600 181\nLeasehold improvements 111 111\nTotal property and equipment 15,092 12,711\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (7,240) (5,577)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 7,852 $ 7,134\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $575,000 and $396,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $540,000 and\n$396,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1.7\nmillion and $1.1 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization\nexpense, excluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $1.6 million and $1.1 million for the nine months ended January\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and April 30, 2022, property, plant and equipment included gross assets held under finance leases\nof $1.1 million and $713,000, respectively. Related depreciation expense was approximately $35,000 and $0 for the three\nmonths ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and approximately $99,000 and $0 for the nine months ended January\n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n13\nCapitalized software development costs under a hosting arrangement\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC-350\"). We capitalize certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the project\nitself will be completed and the software will perform as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related\nexpenses for employees and costs of third-party consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to these\ninternal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is\nready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades, increased functionality, and enhancements to the\nCompany's internal-use software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance, and minor\nmodifications are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method\nover an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nThe Company has capitalized development and implementation costs in accordance with accounting guidance for its\nLumin platform. Lumin is the Company's oncology data-driven software program and data tool which operates as SaaS. These\ncapitalized costs represent salaries, including direct payroll-related costs, certain software development consultant expenses and\nmolecular sequencing programming costs incurred in the engineering and coding of the software development. Capitalized\ncosts are classified as assets in progress during the development process until development is complete and the asset is available\nfor sale. The initial version of the Lumin platform was launched during fiscal year 2021, at which time initial capitalization\nceased and amortization commenced.\nThe Company continued to develop increased functionality, expand product design and usability, and add enhancements to\nthe Lumin platform. In accordance with accounting guidance, these costs were capitalized. This developmental work did not\nrender the initial released version to be obsolete or diminished in value but, rather, added to the base functionality of the\nexisting platform. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, these capitalized costs were placed into service as the enhanced\nversion was launched and made available for sale. The total cost of the Lumin asset placed into service and available for sale\nwas $1.9 million. As of January 31, 2023, the carrying value of the asset net of accumulated amortization was $965,000.\nAmortization expense related to this asset was $157,000 and $79,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and $471,000 and $160,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFinance Lease\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This\nequipment was obtained as the result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $368,000 at\ninception through June 2027. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a\npurchase commitment agreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $368,000 was calculated based on an\ninterest rate of 3.5%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $17,100 and zero for the three\nmonths ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $45,100 and zero for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained as\nthe result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $370,000 at inception through December\n2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase commitment\nagreement. At the commencement of the commitment, the present value of the minimum future obligations of $370,000 was\ncalculated based on an interest rate of 3.25%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $18,000\nand zero for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $54,000 and zero for the nine months ended\nJanuary 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 6.

The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March\n2015 Private Placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into Patient Derived Xenograft\n(PDX) models and use in our pharmacology TOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from nil to\n$30,000 per tumor sample depending on the successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable\nproduct.

Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can stimulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (the \"Platform\"), a comprehensive bank\nof unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we launched Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), an oncology data-driven software program.\nOur Lumin software contains comprehensive information derived from our research services and clinical studies. Lumin\nleverages our large Datacenter coupled with analytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational\ncancer research. It is the combination of the Datacenter and the analytics that create a unique foundation for Lumin. Insights\ndeveloped using Lumin can provide the basis for biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance,\nand guide the direction of additional preclinical evaluations.\n19\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our rich and unique Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other\nadvanced computational analytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental\nplatforms to rapidly validate these targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a rich pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. All expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, we have met these cash requirements through\ncash, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received proceeds from certain\nprivate placements and public offerings of our securities. For the nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company had a net\nloss of approximately $2,774,000 and cash provided by operations of $4.7 million. As of January 31, 2023, the Company had\nan accumulated deficit of approximately $74.8 million and cash on hand of $11.6 million. We believe that our cash on hand,\ntogether with expected cash flows from operations for fiscal year 2023, are adequate to fund operations through at least 12\nmonths from the filing of this 10-Q. However, should our revenue expectations not materialize, we believe we have cost\nreduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the business or restructuring the Company. Should the\nCompany be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that management would be successful in raising such\ncapital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended January 31,\n% of % of %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 12,773 100.0 % $ 13,193 100.0 % (3.2) %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 7,699 60.3 6,406 48.6 20.2\nResearch and development 3,202 25.1 2,181 16.5 46.8\nSales and marketing 1,761 13.8 1,549 11.7 13.7\nGeneral and administrative 2,569 20.1 2,227 16.9 15.4\nTotal costs and operating expenses 15,231 119.3 12,363 93.7 23.2\n(Loss) Income from operations $ (2,458) (19.2) % $ 830 6.3 % (396.1) %\n20\nFor the Nine months ended January 31,\n% of % of %\n2023 Revenue 2022 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 40,799 100.0 % $ 36,232 100.0 % 12.6 %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 22,194 54.4 17,411 48.1 27.5\nResearch and development 8,693 21.3 6,783 18.7 28.2\nSales and marketing 5,153 12.6 4,764 13.1 8.2\nGeneral and administrative 7,494 18.4 6,356 17.5 17.9\nTotal costs and operating expenses 43,534 106.7 35,314 97.4 23.3\n(Loss) Income from operations $ (2,735) (6.7) $ 918 2.5 % (397.9) %\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from pharmacology studies, was $12.8 million and $13.2 million\nfor the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $420,000 or 3.2%. The decrease in revenue\nresulted from an increase in cancellations on studies booked in prior quarters. Oncology services revenue was $40.8 million and\n$36.2 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $4.6 million or 12.6%. The\nincrease in revenue was primarily due to growing demand for our services and platform expansion leading to larger in-vivo and\nex-vivo pharmacology studies.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $7.7 million and $6.4 million,\nrespectively, an increase of $1.3 million or 20.2%. Cost of oncology services for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and\n2022 were $22.2 million and $17.4 million, respectively, an increase of $4.8 million or 27.5%. The increase in cost of oncology\nservices was primarily from compensation expense for our pharmacology operational study teams. For the three months ended\nJanuary 31, 2023 and 2022, total gross margins were 39.7% and 51.4%, respectively. For the nine months ended January 31,\n2023 and 2022, total gross margins were 45.6% and 51.9%, respectively. The lower margin for the fiscal year 2023 third\nquarter and year to date was the result of the increase in compensation expense as we staffed our operational teams to support\nbookings growth during the year, which failed to convert to revenue at the expected rate due to cancellations.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $3.2 million and $2.2\nmillion, respectively, an increase of approximately $1.0 million or 46.8%. Research and development expenses for the nine\nmonths ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $8.7 million and $6.8 million, respectively, an increase of approximately $1.9\nmillion or 28.2%. The increase for the three and nine-month periods was mainly due to compensation and lab supply expense\nrelated to the investment in our therapeutic drug discovery platform.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.8 million and $1.5 million,\nrespectively, an increase of $212,000, or 13.7%. Sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and\n2022 were $5.2 million and $4.8 million, respectively, an increase of $389,000, or 8.2%. The increase for both periods was\nmainly due to compensation and conference expenses to support sales effort expansion.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended January 31, 2023 and 2022 were $2.6 million and $2.2\nmillion, an increase of $342,000, or 15.4%, respectively. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended\nJanuary 31, 2023 and 2022 were $7.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively, an increase of $1.1 million, or 17.9%. General and\n21\nadministrative expenses are primarily comprised of compensation, insurance, professional fees, IT, and depreciation and\namortization expenses. The increase for the three and nine-month period was mainly due to an increase in compensation and IT\nrelated expenses to support the overall infrastructure growth of the Company.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 million for the three months ended January 31, 2023 . The Company\ngenerated cash from operating activities in fiscal year 2023, even with a net loss, primarily from a decrease in accounts\nreceivable, in the ordinary course of business, and an increase in deferred revenue due to strong bookings. Year to date net cash\nprovided by operating activities was $4.7 million. The cash provided by operating activities was primarily due a decrease in\naccounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable balances in the ordinary course of business, along with an increase in\ndeferred revenue.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.1 million and $1.9 million for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. The cash used in investing activities was primarily for the investment in additional lab and computer\nequipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $86,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2023 compared to cash\nprovided by financing activities of $191,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in cash provided by\nfinancing is related to decrease in stock option exercise activity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States\nrequires management to apply methodologies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company include, among other\nthings, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition (replacement of licensed tumors), valuation allowance for deferred\ntax assets, valuation of goodwill, and stock compensation and warrant assumptions. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. The Company’s critical accounting policies are summarized in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed\nwith the SEC on July 22, 2022.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, see Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\" in the accompanying Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report on Form 10-Q.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that\nare not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee\nany third-party debt.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n22\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIt is management’s responsibility to establish and maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Our management, with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating\nour disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is\nrequired to apply its judgment in evaluating the relationship between the benefit of desired controls and procedures and the cost\nof implementing new controls and procedures.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023. Based\non that assessment, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2023 at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring\nthat information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Further, management concluded that our consolidated\nfinancial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rule\n13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n23\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item; however, the\ndiscussion of our business and operations and the below risk factor should be read together with the Risk Factors set forth in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 22, 2022. Such risks and\nuncertainties have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, strategies or\nprospects in a material and adverse manner.\nOur cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions, in which we hold our cash balances,\nfail.\nWe regularly maintain cash balances at several third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) insurance limit. The failure of, or any other adverse condition suffered by, one or more of these financial\ninstitutions could result in our inability to obtain the return of our funds and/or could impact our access to our cash which could\nadversely impact our operating liquidity and financial performance.\nItem 2.

Organization, Use of Estimates and Basis of Presentation\nChampions Oncology, Inc. is a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology\nsolutions to be utilized in drug discovery and development. The Company's research center operates in both regulatory and non-\nregulatory environments and consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental research platforms. Its\npharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and development at lower costs and\nincreased speeds.\nThe Company has three operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited, Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, and Champions Oncology, S.R.L. (Italy). For the three and six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, there were\nno revenues earned by these subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in\nearnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s international\noperations.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been\neliminated. Certain information related to the Company’s organization, significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures\nnormally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates, or GAAP, has been condensed or omitted. The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the Company’s annual consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended April 30, 2022, as filed on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows for the periods presented and the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate when read in\nconjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022. The results of operations for\nthe interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full fiscal year.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\n8\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022 the Company had no cash\nequivalents.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the\nlaunch of new products, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, the Company has met these cash\nrequirements through cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, the Company\nhas also received proceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities. For the six months ended\nOctober 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss of approximately $335,000 and cash provided by operations of $3.1 million. As\nof October 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $72.3 million, working capital of $1.9 million\nand cash on hand of $10.8 million. The Company believes that cash on hand, together with expected net positive cash provided\nby operations for fiscal year 2023, are adequate to fund operations through at least 12 months from the filing of this 10-Q.\nHowever, should the Company's revenue expectations not materialize, the Company believes it has cost reduction strategies that\ncould be implemented without disrupting the business or restructuring the Company. Should the Company be required to raise\nadditional capital, there can be no assurance that management would be successful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to\nus, if at all.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") Topic 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as\noperating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease\nliability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease, if applicable, or the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value\nof lease payments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is\namortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset\nresult in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock options.\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, all of the Company's potential common stock is considered anti-dilutive.\nThe following table reflects the total potential share-based instruments outstanding at October 31, 2022 and 2021 that could\nhave an effect on the future computation of dilution per common share, had their effect not been anti-dilutive:\nOctober 31,\n2022 2021\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,675,447 1,634,928\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of\nexpenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the\n9\nlikelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the\nextent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient earnings history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company's\nability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be limited if the Company\nhad undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n“IRC”). The Company adjusts the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that\ndeferred tax assets will or will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax\nprovision in the period of change. As of October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022, the Company provided a valuation allowance for\nall net deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the assets will not be recovered based on an insufficient history of\nearnings.\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain the tax\nposition, based on its technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest\namount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company recorded $181,000 of liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations as of October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany did not recognize interest or penalties on its consolidated statements of operations during the three or six-month\nperiods ended October 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during\nthe next 12 months.\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $14,000 and $12,000,\nrespectively. The provision for income taxes for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $31,000 and $26,000,\nrespectively. The provision is attributable to taxable income earned in Israel and/or Italy relating to transfer pricing.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The objective of\nthe standard is to establish a single comprehensive revenue recognition model that is designed to create greater comparability of\nfinancial statements across industries and jurisdictions. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the transfer\nof goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in\nexchange for those goods or services.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company's arrangements are service type contracts that mainly\nhave a duration of less than a year. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is transferred to the\ncustomer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to\nbe entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the following five steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract (promised goods\nor services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of the product or service for each\nperformance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities, such as value\nadded taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\n10\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms.\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as the Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nAccounting Pronouncements Being Evaluated\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit\nLosses\". This update requires immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (\"CECL\").\nUnder the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred. The new model is applicable to all financial\ninstruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The standard is effective for the fiscal year beginning\nMay 1, 2023 for the Company. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on our consolidated financial\nstatements and does not anticipate a significant impact.\nNote 3. Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nAccounts receivable and unbilled services were as follows (in thousands)\n11\nOctober 31,\n2022 April 30, 2022\nAccounts receivable $ 5,392 $ 6,037\nUnbilled services 4,316 4,106\nTotal accounts receivable and unbilled services 9,708 10,143\nLess allowance for doubtful accounts (760) (630)\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 8,948 $ 9,513\nDeferred revenue was as follows (in thousands):\nOctober 31,\n2022 April 30, 2022\nDeferred revenue $ 11,185 $ 11,071\nDeferred revenue is shown as a current liability on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 4. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nOncology Services Revenue\nThe following tables represents disaggregated revenue for the three and six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nOctober 31, October 31,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nPharmacology services $ 13,480 $ 11,143 $ 26,236 $ 21,846\nOther TOS revenue 731 643 1,679 1,169\nPersonalized oncology services 70 — 111 24\nTotal oncology services revenue $ 14,281 $ 11,786 $ 28,026 $ 23,039\nOther TOS revenue represents additional services provided to the Company's pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers,\nspecifically flow cytometry services and software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") provided via our Lumin Bioinformatics software\n(\"Lumin\").\nContract Balances\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to the\ncustomer for which the right to payment is subject to factors other than the passage of time. These amounts may not exceed\ntheir net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current and included in accounts receivable. Contract liabilities\nconsist of customer payments received in advance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue\nrecognized from the balance at the beginning of the period and included in deferred revenue. Contract assets and liabilities are\npresented on the balance sheet on a net contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nNote 5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and primarily consists of laboratory equipment, computer equipment and\nsoftware, capitalized software development costs, and furniture and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various assets ranging from three to nine years. Property and equipment\nconsisted of the following (table in thousands):\n12\nOctober 31, April 30,\n2022 2022\nFurniture and fixtures $ 246 $ 246\nComputer equipment and software 1,967 1,667\nCapitalized software development costs 1,888 1,888\nLaboratory equipment 9,654 8,618\nAssets in progress 507 181\nLeasehold improvements 111 111\nTotal property and equipment 14,373 12,711\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (6,665) (5,577)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 7,708 $ 7,134\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $560,000 and $346,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $525,000 and\n$346,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1.1\nmillion and $663,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Depreciation and amortization\nexpense, excluding expense recorded under finance leases, was $1.0 million and $663,000 for the six months ended October 31,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022, property, plant and equipment included gross assets held under finance leases\nof $1.1 million and $713,000, respectively. Related depreciation expense was approximately $35,000 and $0 for the three\nmonths ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and approximately $64,000 and $0 for the six months ended October\n31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCapitalized software development costs under a hosting arrangement\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC-350\"). We capitalize certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the project\nitself will be completed and the software will perform as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related\nexpenses for employees and costs of third-party consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to these\ninternal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is\nready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades, increased functionality, and enhancements to the\nCompany's internal-use software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance, and minor\nmodifications are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method\nover an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nThe Company has capitalized development and implementation costs in accordance with accounting guidance for its\nLumin platform. Lumin is the Company's oncology data-driven software program and data tool which operates as SaaS. These\ncapitalized costs represent salaries, including direct payroll-related costs, certain software development consultant expenses and\nmolecular sequencing programming costs incurred in the engineering and coding of the software development. Capitalized\ncosts are classified as assets in progress during the development process until development is complete and the asset is available\nfor sale. The initial version of the Lumin platform was launched during fiscal year 2021, at which time initial capitalization\nceased and amortization commenced.\nThe Company continued to develop increased functionality, expand product design and usability, and add enhancements to\nthe Lumin platform. In accordance with accounting guidance, these costs were capitalized. This developmental work did not\nrender the initial released version to be obsolete or diminished in value but, rather, added to the base functionality of the\nexisting platform. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, these capitalized costs were placed into service as the enhanced\nversion was launched and made available for sale. The total cost of the Lumin asset placed into service and available for sale\nwas $1.9 million. As of October 31, 2022, the carrying value of the asset net of accumulated amortization was $1.1 million.\nAmortization expense related to this asset was $157,000 and $40,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, and, $314,000 and $81,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n13\nFinance Lease\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained as\nthe result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $370,000 at inception through December\n2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase commitment\nagreement. At the commencement of the commitment, the present value of the minimum future obligations of $370,000 was\ncalculated based on an interest rate of 3.25%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $18,000\nand zero for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $36,000 and zero for the six months ended\nOctober 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This\nequipment was obtained as the result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $368,000 at\ninception through June 2027. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a\npurchase commitment agreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $368,000 was calculated based on an\ninterest rate of 3.5%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $17,000 and zero for the three\nmonths ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $28,000 and zero for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nNote 6.

In general, these plans\nprovide for stock-based compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and non-employees. The plans also provide for\nlimits on the aggregate number of shares that may be granted, the term of grants and the strike price of option awards.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nAs part of the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan\n(“2021 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to grant (i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Incentive Stock\nOptions; (iii) Restricted Stock Awards; and/or (iv) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based compensation) to its\nemployees, directors and non-employees.

The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March\n2015 Private Placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into PDX models and use in\nour TOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from nil to $30,000 per tumor sample depending on\nthe successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable product. The upfront costs are expensed as\nincurred. In addition, under certain agreements, for a limited period of time, the Company is subject to royalty payments if the\nlicensed tumor models are used for sale in our TOS business, ranging from 2% to 20% of the contract price after recouping\ncertain initiation costs. Some of these arrangements also set forth an annual minimum royalty due regardless of tumor models\n17\nused for sale. For the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recognized approximately $32,000 and\n$147,000, respectively, in expense related to these royalty arrangements. For the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021,\nwe have recognized approximately $108,000 and $199,000 in expense related to these royalty arrangements, respectively.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in\nconjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report and\nour most recent annual report for the year ended April 30, 2022, as filed on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements,” which include information relating to\nfuture events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment, regulation, and availability of\nresources. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: proposed new programs;\nexpectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,\nresults of operations, or liquidity; statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates, or forecasts as to our\nbusiness, financial and operational results, and future economic performance; and statements of management’s goals and\nobjectives and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “should,”\n“could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”\n“estimates” and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be\naccurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are\nbased on information available at the time those statements are made or management’s good faith belief as of that time with\nrespect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. Factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in “Risk Factors”\nin Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, as updated in our subsequent\nreports filed with the SEC, including any updates found in Part II, Item 1A of this or other reports on Form 10-Q, if any. You\nshould not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking\nstatements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information,\nexcept to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no\ninference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized\nin drug discovery and development. Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can stimulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (\"The Platform\"), a comprehensive\n18\nBank of unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we launched Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), an oncology data-driven software program.\nOur Lumin software contains comprehensive information derived from our research services and clinical studies. Lumin\nleverages our large Datacenter coupled with analytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool for computational\ncancer research. It is the combination of the Datacenter and the analytics that create a unique foundation for Lumin. Insights\ndeveloped using Lumin can provide the basis for biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance,\nand guide the direction of additional preclinical evaluations.\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our rich and unique Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other\nadvanced computational analytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental\nplatforms to rapidly validate these targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a rich pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. Any expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, we have met these cash requirements through\ncash, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received proceeds from certain\nprivate placements and public offerings of our securities. For the six months ended October 31, 2022, the Company had a net\nloss of approximately $335,000 and cash provided by operations of $3.1 million. As of October 31, 2022, the Company had an\naccumulated deficit of approximately $72.3 million, working capital of $1.9 million, and cash of $10.8 million. We believe that\nour cash on hand, together with expected positive cash flows from operations for fiscal year 2023, are adequate to fund\noperations through at least 12 months from the filing of this 10-Q. However, should our revenue expectations not materialize,\nwe believe we have cost reduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the business or restructuring the\nCompany. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that management would be\nsuccessful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\n19\nFor the Three Months Ended October 31,\n% of % of %\n2022 Revenue 2021 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 14,281 100.0 % $ 11,786 100.0 % 21.2 %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 7,443 52.2 5,609 47.6 32.7\nResearch and development 2,604 18.2 2,299 19.5 13.3\nSales and marketing 1,700 11.9 1,640 13.9 3.7\nGeneral and administrative 2,527 17.7 1,975 16.8 27.9\nTotal costs and operating expenses 14,274 100.0 11,523 97.8 23.9\nIncome from operations $ 7 — % $ 263 2.2 % (97.3) %\nFor the Six months ended October 31,\n% of % of %\n2022 Revenue 2021 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 28,026 100.0 % $ 23,039 100.0 % 21.6 %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 14,495 51.7 11,005 47.8 31.7\nResearch and development 5,491 19.6 4,603 20.0 19.3\nSales and marketing 3,392 12.1 3,214 14.0 5.5\nGeneral and administrative 4,925 17.6 4,129 17.9 19.3\nTotal costs and operating expenses 28,303 101.0 22,951 99.6 23.3\nIncome (loss) from operations $ (277) (1.0) $ 88 0.4 % (414.8) %\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from pharmacology studies, was $14.3 million and $11.8 million\nfor the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $2.5 million or 21.2%. Oncology services\nrevenue was $28.0 million and $23.0 million for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of\n$5.0 million or 21.6%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to continued demand for our services and platform expansion\nleading to larger in-vivo and ex-vivo pharmacology studies.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $7.4 million and $5.6 million,\nrespectively, an increase of $1.8 million or 32.7%. Cost of oncology services for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and\n2021 were $14.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively, an increase of $3.5 million or 31.7%. The increase in cost of\noncology services was primarily from compensation, mice and supply expenses for pharmacology studies and compensation\nexpense for our SaaS platform. For the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, total gross margins were 47.9% and\n52.4%, respectively. For the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, total gross margins were 48.3% and 52.2%,\nrespectively. For the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, gross margins for pharmacology services were 50.5%\nand 53.1%, respectively. For the six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, gross margins for pharmacology services were\n51.1% and 52.8%, respectively. The lower pharmacology margins resulted from an increase in up-front study related expenses\nin advance of the revenue recognition. Additionally, Lumin related depreciation and amortization expense during the three and\nsix months ended October 31, 2022 was higher compared to the three and six months ended October 31, 2021, contributing to\nthe total margin decline.\n20\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2.6 million and $2.3\nmillion, respectively, an increase of approximately $305,000 or 13.3%. Research and development expenses for the six months\nended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $5.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, an increase of approximately $888,000 or\n19.3%. The increase for the three and six-month periods was mainly due to compensation and lab supply expense related to the\ninvestment in our therapeutic drug discovery platform.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1.7 million and $1.6 million,\nrespectively, an increase of $60,000, or 3.7%. Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and\n2021 were $3.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively, an increase of 178,000, or 5.5%. The increase for both periods was\nmainly due to compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2.5 million and $2.0\nmillion, an increase of $552,000, or 27.9%. General and administrative expenses for the six months ended October 31, 2022\nand 2021 were $4.9 million and $4.1 million, an increase of $800,000, or 19.3%. General and administrative expenses are\nprimarily comprised of compensation, insurance, professional fees, IT, and depreciation and amortization expenses. The\nincrease for the three and six-month period was mainly due to an increase in compensation and IT related expenses to support\nthe overall infrastructure growth of the Company. Additionally, bad debt expense increased during the three and six-month\nperiods ended October 31, 2022, compared to the three and six-month periods ended October 31, 2021.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 million compared to net cash provided by operations of $1.4 million for\nthe six months ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The cash provided by operating activities during the current\nperiod was primarily due to positive operating results excluding non-cash expenses combined with increases in accounts\nreceivable collections and accounts payable balances in the ordinary course of business.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.4 million and $1.5 million for the six months ended October 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively. The cash used in investing activities was primarily for the investment in additional lab and computer\nequipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $86,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2022 compared to cash\nprovided by financing activities of $123,000 for the six months ended October 31, 2021. The decrease in cash provided by\nfinancing is related to decrease in stock option exercise activity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States\nrequires management to apply methodologies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company include, among other\nthings, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition (replacement of licensed tumors), valuation allowance for deferred\ntax assets, valuation of goodwill, and stock compensation and warrant assumptions. Actual results could differ from those\nestimates. The Company’s critical accounting policies are summarized in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed\nwith the SEC on July 22, 2022.\n21\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, see Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\" in the accompanying Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report on Form 10-Q.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that\nare not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee\nany third-party debt.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIt is management’s responsibility to establish and maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). Our management, with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating\nour disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed\nand operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is\nrequired to apply its judgment in evaluating the relationship between the benefit of desired controls and procedures and the cost\nof implementing new controls and procedures.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022. Based\non that assessment, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have concluded\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring\nthat information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,\nsummarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and is\naccumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Further, management concluded that our consolidated\nfinancial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects, the Company’s financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rule\n13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n22\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Organization, Use of Estimates and Basis of Presentation\nChampions Oncology, Inc is a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology\nsolutions to be utilized in drug discovery and development. The Company's research center operates in both regulatory and non-\nregulatory environments and consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental research platforms. Its\npharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and development at lower costs and\nincreased speeds.\nThe Company has three operating subsidiaries: Champions Oncology (Israel), Limited, Champions Biotechnology U.K.,\nLimited, and Champions Oncology, S.R.L. (Italy). For the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no revenues\nearned by these subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in\nearnings. The Company is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the Company’s international\noperations.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been\neliminated. Certain information related to the Company’s organization, significant accounting policies and footnote disclosures\nnormally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates, or GAAP, has been condensed or omitted. The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those followed in the Company’s annual consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended April 30, 2022, as filed on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments necessary to fairly state our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows for the periods presented and the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate when read in\nconjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2022. The results of operations for\nthe interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full fiscal year.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nfinancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\n8\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash, and with original\nmaturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of July 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022 the Company had no cash\nequivalents.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of\nnew products, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, we have met these cash requirements\nthrough our cash on hand, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received\nproceeds from certain private placements and public offerings of our securities. For the three months ended July 31, 2022, the\nCompany had a net loss of approximately $319,000 and cash used in operations of $195,000. As of July 31, 2022, the Company\nhad an accumulated deficit of approximately $72.3 million, working capital of $1.8 million and cash of $8.1 million. We\nbelieve that our cash on hand, together with expected net positive cash provided by operations for fiscal year 2023, are adequate\nto fund operations through at least 12 months from the filing of this 10-Q. However, should our revenue expectations not\nmaterialize, we believe we have cost reduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the business or\nrestructuring the Company. Should the Company be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that\nmanagement would be successful in raising such capital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") Topic 842, Leases. Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as\noperating or financing leases and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability,\ncalculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease, if applicable, or the\nCompany’s incremental borrowing rate. As the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value\nof lease payments. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is\namortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset\nresult in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income or loss per share is computed by dividing the net income or loss for the period by the weighted-average\nnumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing the net\nincome for the period by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock plus dilutive potential common stock\nconsidered outstanding during the period. Such dilutive shares consist of incremental shares that would be issued upon exercise\nof the Company’s common stock options.\nAs of July 31, 2022 and 2021, all of the Company's potential common stock is considered anti-dilutive.\nThe following table reflects the total potential share-based instruments outstanding at July 31, 2022 and 2021 that could\nhave an effect on the future computation of dilution per common share, had their effect not been anti-dilutive:\nJuly 31,\n2022 2021\nTotal common stock equivalents 1,722,155 1,734,428\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of\nexpenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and their reported\namounts in the consolidated financial statements. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company assesses the\n9\nlikelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered through tax planning strategies or from future taxable income, and to the\nextent that recovery is not likely or there is insufficient earnings history, a valuation allowance is established. The Company's\nability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be limited if the Company\nhad undergone or were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n“IRC”). The Company adjusts the valuation allowance in the period management determines it is more likely than not that\ndeferred tax assets will or will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax\nprovision in the period of change. As of July 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022, the Company provided a valuation allowance for all\nnet deferred tax assets, as recovery is not more likely than not based on an insufficient history of earnings.\nThe Company reflects tax benefits only if it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to sustain the tax\nposition, based on its technical merits. If a tax benefit meets this criterion, it is measured and recognized based on the largest\namount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. The Company recorded $181,000 of liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions relative to one of its foreign operations as of July 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022.\nThe Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The\nCompany did not recognize interest or penalties on its consolidated statements of operations during the three-month periods\nended July 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded during the next 12\nmonths.\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 was $17,000 and $14,000, respectively,\nmainly attributable to taxable income earned in Israel and/or Italy relating to transfer pricing.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The objective of\nthe standard is to establish a single comprehensive revenue recognition model that is designed to create greater comparability of\nfinancial statements across industries and jurisdictions. Under this standard, companies recognize revenue to depict the transfer\nof goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in\nexchange for those goods or services.\nAll revenue is generated from contracts with customers. The Company's arrangements are service type contracts that mainly\nhave a duration of less than a year. The Company recognizes revenue when control of these services is transferred to the\ncustomer in an amount, referred to as the transaction price, that reflects the consideration to which the Company is expected to\nbe entitled in exchange for those services. The Company determines revenue recognition utilizing the following five steps: (1)\nidentification of the contract with a customer, (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract (promised goods\nor services that are distinct), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations, and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company transfers control of the product or service for each\nperformance obligation. The Company records revenues net of any tax assessments by governmental authorities, such as value\nadded taxes, that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue generating transactions.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue arrangements are service contracts that are completed within a year or less. There\nare a few contracts that range in duration between 1 and 3 years. Substantially all of the Company's performance obligations,\nand associated revenue, are transferred to the customer over time. Most of the Company's contracts can be terminated by the\ncustomer without cause. In the event of termination, the Company's contracts provide that the customer pay the Company for\nservices rendered through the termination date. The Company generally receives compensation based on a predetermined\ninvoicing schedule relating to specific milestones for that contract.\nAmendments to contracts are common. The Company evaluates each amendment which meets the criteria of a contract\nmodification under ASC 606. Each modification is further evaluated to determine whether the contract modification should be\naccounted for as a separate contract or as a continuation of the original agreement.\nThe Company accounts for amendments as a separate contract as they meet the criteria under ASC 606-10-25-12.\nPharmacology Study and Other Services\nThe Company generally enters into contracts with customers to provide oncology services with payments based on fixed-\nfee arrangements. At contract inception, the Company assesses the services promised in the contracts with customers to identify\nthe performance obligations in the arrangement. The Company's fixed-fee arrangements for oncology services are considered a\nsingle performance obligation because the Company provides a highly-integrated service.\n10\nThe Company recognizes revenue over time using a progress-based input method since there is no single output measure\nthat would fairly depict the transfer of control over the life of the performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for the single\nperformance obligation over time due to the Company's right to payment for work performed to date and the performance does\nnot create an asset with an alternative use. The Company recognizes revenue as portions of the overall performance obligation\nare completed as this best depicts the progress of the performance obligation.\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract (Sales Commissions)\nUnder ASC 606, the costs of obtaining a contract can be expensed immediately, rather than capitalized and amortized, if\nthe amortization period is one year or shorter. Sales commissions for the Company represent contract costs with a term of one\nyear or less. Therefore, under ASC 606, the Company elected the practical expedient to expense these costs as incurred.\nVariable Consideration\nIn some cases, contracts provide for variable consideration that is contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future\nevents, such as the success of the initial performance obligation. Variable consideration is estimated at the expected value or at\nthe most likely amount depending on the type of consideration. Estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the\nextent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is resolved. The estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include\nestimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of its anticipated performance and all information\n(historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company.\nTrade Receivables, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nIn general, billings and payments are established by contractual provisions including predetermined payment schedules,\nwhich may or may not correspond to the timing of the transfer of control of the Company's services under the contract. In\ngeneral, the Company's intention in its invoicing (payment terms) is to maintain cash neutrality over the life of the contract.\nUpfront payments, when they occur, are intended to cover certain expenses the Company incurs at the beginning of the\ncontract. Neither the Company nor its customers view such upfront payments and contracted payment schedules as a means of\nfinancing. Unbilled services primarily arise when the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Such\nsituations occur due to divergences between revenue recognition and the invoicing milestones which are based on\npredetermined payment terms.\nDeferred revenue consists of unearned payments received in excess of revenue recognized. As the contracted services are\nsubsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the deferred revenue balance is reduced by the amount of the\nrevenue recognized during the period. Deferred revenue is classified as a current liability on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as the Company expects to recognize the associated revenue in less than one year.\nAccounting Pronouncements Being Evaluated\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit\nLosses\". This update requires immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current expected credit losses (\"CECL\").\nUnder the prior model, losses were recognized only as they were incurred. The new model is applicable to all financial\ninstruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2022 for public entities qualifying as small reporting companies. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is\ncurrently assessing the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements and do not anticipate a significant impact.\nNote 3. Accounts Receivable, Unbilled Services and Deferred Revenue\nAccounts receivable and unbilled services were as follows (in thousands):\n11\nJuly 31, 2022 April 30, 2022\nAccounts receivable $ 5,619 $ 6,037\nUnbilled services 4,366 4,106\nTotal accounts receivable and unbilled services 9,985 10,143\nLess allowance for doubtful accounts (630) (630)\nTotal accounts receivable, net $ 9,355 $ 9,513\nDeferred revenue was as follows (in thousands):\nJuly 31, 2022 April 30, 2022\nDeferred revenue $ 10,885 $ 11,071\nDeferred revenue is shown as a current liability on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 4. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nOncology Services Revenue\nThe following tables represents disaggregated revenue for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021:\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2022 2021\nPharmacology services $ 12,756 $ 10,703\nOther TOS revenue 948 526\nPersonalized oncology services 41 24\nTotal oncology services revenue $ 13,745 $ 11,253\nOther TOS revenue represents additional services provided to the Company's pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers,\nspecifically flow cytometry services and SaaS provided via our Lumin Bioinformatics software (\"Lumin\").\nContract Balances\nContract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from revenue recognized in excess of the amounts billed to the\ncustomer for which the right to payment is subject to factors other than the passage of time. These amounts may not exceed\ntheir net realizable value. Contract assets are classified as current. Contract liabilities consist of customer payments received in\nadvance of performance and billings in excess of revenue recognized, net of revenue recognized from the balance at the\nbeginning of the period. Contract assets and liabilities are presented on the balance sheet on a net contract-by-contract basis at\nthe end of each reporting period.\nNote 5. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and primarily consists of laboratory equipment, computer equipment and\nsoftware, capitalized software development costs, and furniture and fixtures. Depreciation and amortization is calculated on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various assets ranging from three to nine years. Property and equipment\nconsisted of the following (table in thousands):\n12\nJuly 31, April 30,\n2022 2022\nFurniture and fixtures $ 246 $ 246\nComputer equipment and software 1,953 1,667\nCapitalized software development costs 1,888 1,888\nLaboratory equipment 9,073 8,618\nAssets in progress 532 181\nLeasehold improvements 111 111\nTotal property and equipment 13,803 12,711\nLess: Accumulated depreciation (6,105) (5,577)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 7,698 $ 7,134\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $528,000 and $317,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. Depreciation and amortization expense, excluding expense recorded under finances leases, was $499,000 and\n$317,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of July 31, 2022 and April 30, 2022, property, plant and equipment included gross assets held under finance leases of\n$1,081,000 and $713,000, respectively. Related depreciation expense was approximately $29,000 and $0 for the three months\nended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCapitalized software development costs under a hosting arrangement\nThe Company accounts for the cost of computer software obtained or developed for internal use as well as the software\ndevelopment and implementation costs associated with a hosting arrangement (\"internal-use software\") that is a service contract\nin accordance and with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\"ASC-350\"). We capitalize certain costs in the\ndevelopment of our internal-use software when the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the project\nitself will be completed and the software will perform as intended. These capitalized costs include personnel and related\nexpenses for employees and costs of third-party consultants who are directly associated with and who devote time to these\ninternal-use software projects. Capitalization of these costs ceases once the project is substantially complete and the software is\nready for its intended purpose. Costs incurred for significant upgrades, increased functionality, and enhancements to the\nCompany's internal-use software solutions are also capitalized. Costs incurred for training, maintenance, and minor\nmodifications are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line method\nover an estimated useful economic life of three years.\nThe Company has capitalized development and implementation costs in accordance with accounting guidance for its\nLumin platform. Lumin is the Company's oncology data-driven software program and data tool which operates as Software as a\nService. These capitalized costs represent salaries, including direct payroll-related costs, certain software development\nconsultant expenses and molecular sequencing programming costs incurred in the engineering and coding of the software\ndevelopment. Capitalized costs are classified as assets in progress during the development process until development is\ncomplete and the asset is available for sale. The initial version of the Lumin platform was launched during fiscal year 2021, at\nwhich time initial capitalization ceased and amortization commenced.\nThe Company continued to develop increased functionality, expand product design and usability, and add enhancements to\nthe Lumin platform. In accordance with accounting guidance, these costs were capitalized. This developmental work did not\nrender the initial released version to be obsolete or diminished in value but, rather, added to the base functionality of the\nexisting platform. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, these capitalized costs were placed into service as the enhanced\nversion was launched and made available for sale. The total cost of the Lumin asset placed into service and available for sale\nwas $1.9 million. As of July 31, 2022, the carrying value of the asset net of accumulated amortization was $1.3 million.\nAmortization expense related to this asset was $157,000 and $40,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nFinance Lease\n13\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This equipment was obtained as\nthe result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $370,000 at inception through December\n2025. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a purchase commitment\nagreement. At the commencement of the commitment, the present value of the minimum future obligations of $370,000 was\ncalculated based on an interest rate of 3.25%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $18,000\nand zero for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized a finance lease for laboratory equipment. This\nequipment was obtained as the result of a laboratory supplies purchase commitment with costs of approximately $368,000 at\ninception through June 2027. Cash payments for this lease are in the form of consideration for purchasing lab supplies under a\npurchase commitment agreement. The present value of the minimum future obligations of $368,000 was calculated based on an\ninterest rate of 3.5%. Depreciation and amortization expense related to this finance lease was $11,250 and zero for the three\nmonths ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 6. Share-Based Payments\nStock-based compensation expense was recognized as follows (table in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nJuly 31,\n2022 2021\nGeneral and administrative $ 123 $ 171\nSales and marketing 48 51\nResearch and development 3 6\nCost of oncology services 32 52\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 206 $ 280\nThe Company has in place a 2021 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (\"the Plans\"). In general, these plans\nprovide for stock-based compensation to the Company’s employees, directors and non-employees. The plans also provide for\nlimits on the aggregate number of shares that may be granted, the term of grants and the strike price of option awards.\n2021 Equity Incentive Plan\nAs part of the 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan\n(“2021 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2021 Equity Plan is to grant (i) Non-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Incentive Stock\nOptions; (iii) Restricted Stock Awards; and/or (iv) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based compensation) to its\nemployees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2021 Equity Plan shall not exceed 2 million shares of\ncommon stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of grant and the awards vest\nas determined by the Board of Directors. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights have a strike price not less than 100% of the\nfair market value of the common stock subject to the option or right at the date of grant. As of July 31, 2022, approximately\n1.7 million shares were left to issue under this plan.\n2010 Equity Incentive Plan\nOn February 18, 2011, shareholders owning a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company executed a written\nconsent approving the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (“2010 Equity Plan”). The purpose of the 2010 Equity Plan is to grant (i)\nNon-statutory Stock Options; (ii) Restricted Stock Awards; and (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights (collectively, stock-based\ncompensation) to its employees, directors and non-employees. Total stock awards under the 2010 Equity Plan shall not exceed\n30 million shares of common stock. Options and Stock Appreciation Rights expire no later than ten years from the date of grant\nand the awards vest as determined by the Board of Directors.

The Company is not aware of any other matters\nthat would have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nRegistration Payment Arrangements\nThe Company has entered into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement in connection with the March\n2015 Private Placement. This Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement contains provisions that may call for the\nCompany to pay penalties in certain circumstances. This registration payment arrangement primarily relates to the Company’s\nability to file a registration statement within a particular time period, have a registration statement declared effective within a\nparticular time period and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a particular time period. The Company\nhas not accrued any liquidated damages associated with the Amended and Restated Registration Right Agreement as the\nCompany has filed the required registration statement and anticipates continued compliance with the agreement.\nRoyalties\nThe Company contracts with third-party vendors to license tumor samples for development into PDX models and use in\nour TOS business. These types of arrangements have an upfront fee ranging from nil to $30,000 per tumor sample depending on\nthe successful growth of the tumor model and ability to develop them into a sellable product. The upfront costs are expensed as\nincurred. In addition, under certain agreements, for a limited period of time, the Company is subject to royalty payments if the\nlicensed tumor models are used for sale in our TOS business, ranging from 2% to 20% of the contract price after recouping\ncertain initiation costs. Some of these arrangements also set forth an annual minimum royalty due regardless of tumor models\nused for sale. For the quarter ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, we have recognized approximately $76,000 and $44,000 in\nexpense related to these royalty arrangements, respectively.\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our historical results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources should be read in\nconjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report and\nour most recent annual report for the year ended April 30, 2022, as filed on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain “forward-looking statements,” which include information relating to\nfuture events, future financial performance, strategies, expectations, competitive environment, regulation, and availability of\nresources. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding: proposed new programs;\nexpectations that regulatory developments or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position,\nresults of operations, or liquidity; statements concerning projections, predictions, expectations, estimates, or forecasts as to our\n17\nbusiness, financial and operational results, and future economic performance; and statements of management’s goals and\nobjectives and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Words such as “may,” “should,”\n“could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,”\n“estimates” and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be\naccurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are\nbased on information available at the time those statements are made or management’s good faith belief as of that time with\nrespect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. Factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those described in “Risk Factors”\nin Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, as updated in our subsequent\nreports filed with the SEC, including any updates found in Part II, Item 1A of this or other reports on Form 10-Q, if any. You\nshould not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking\nstatements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information,\nexcept to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no\ninference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a technology-enabled research organization engaged in creating transformative technology solutions to be utilized\nin drug discovery and development. Our research center consists of a comprehensive set of computational and experimental\nresearch platforms. Our pharmacology, biomarker, and data platforms are designed to facilitate drug discovery and\ndevelopment at lower costs and increased speeds. We perform studies which we believe may predict the efficacy of\nexperimental oncology drugs or approved drugs as stand-alone therapies or in combination with other drugs and can stimulate\nthe results of human clinical trials. These studies include in vivo studies that rely on implanting multiple tumors from our\nTumorBank in mice and testing the therapy of interest on these tumors. Studies may also include bioinformatics analysis that\nreveal the differences in the genetic signatures of the tumors that responded to a therapy as compared to the tumors that did not\nrespond. Additionally, we provide computational or experimental support to identify novel therapeutic targets, select\nappropriate patient populations for clinical evaluation, identify potential therapeutic combination strategies, and develop\nbiomarker hypothesis of sensitivity or resistance. These studies include the use of our in vivo, ex vivo, analytical and\ncomputational platforms.\nWe are engaged in the development and sale of advanced technology solutions and products to personalize the development\nand use of oncology drugs through our Translational Oncology Solutions (\"TOS\"). This technology ranges from computational-\nbased discovery platforms, unique oncology software solutions, and innovative and proprietary experimental tools such as in\nvivo, ex vivo and biomarker platforms. Utilizing our TumorGraft Technology Platform (\"The Platform\"), a comprehensive\nBank of unique, well characterized models, we provide select services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking\npersonalized approaches to drug development. By performing studies to predict the efficacy of oncology drugs, our Platform\nfacilitates drug discovery with lower costs and increased speed of drug development as well as increased adoption of existing\ndrugs.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we launched Lumin Bioinformatics (\"Lumin\"), a new oncology data-driven software\nprogram, during fiscal 2021. Our Lumin software contains comprehensive information derived from our research services and\nclinical studies. Lumin leverages our large Datacenter coupled with analytics and artificial intelligence to provide a robust tool\nfor computational cancer research. It is the combination of the Datacenter and the analytics that create a unique foundation for\nLumin. Insights developed using Lumin can provide the basis for biomarker hypotheses, reveal potential mechanisms of\ntherapeutic resistance, and guide the direction of additional preclinical evaluations.\nOur drug discovery and development business leverages the computational and experimental capabilities within our\nplatforms. Our discovery strategy utilizes our rich and unique Datacenter, coupled with artificial intelligence and other\nadvanced computational analytics, to identify novel therapeutic targets. We then employ the use of our proprietary experimental\nplatforms to rapidly validate these targets for further drug development efforts.\nWe have a rich pipeline of targets at various stages of discovery and validation, with a select group that has progressed to\ntherapeutic development. Our commercial strategy for the validated targets and therapeutics established from this business is\n18\nwide-ranging and still being developed. It will depend on many factors, and will be specific for each target or therapeutic area\nidentified. Any expenses associated with this part of our business are research and development and are expensed as incurred.\nWe regularly evaluate strategic options to create additional value from our drug discovery business, which may include, but\nare not limited to, potential spin-out transactions or capital raises.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity needs have typically arisen from the funding of our research and development programs and the launch of new\nproducts, working capital requirements, and other strategic initiatives. Recently, we have met these cash requirements through\ncash, working capital management, and sales of products and services. In the past, we have also received proceeds from certain\nprivate placements and public offerings of our securities. For the three months ended July 31, 2022, the Company had a net loss\nof approximately $319,000 and cash used in operations of $195,000. As of July 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated\ndeficit of approximately $72.3 million, working capital of $1.8 million, and cash of $8.1 million. We believe that our cash on\nhand, together with expected positive cash flows from operations for fiscal year 2023, are adequate to fund operations through\nat least 12 months from the filing of this 10-Q. However, should our revenue expectations not materialize, we believe we have\ncost reduction strategies that could be implemented without disrupting the business or restructuring the Company. Should the\nCompany be required to raise additional capital, there can be no assurance that management would be successful in raising such\ncapital on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes our operating results for the periods presented below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended July 31,\n% of % of %\n2022 Revenue 2021 Revenue Change\nOncology services revenue $ 13,745 100.0 % $ 11,253 100.0 % 22.1 %\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of oncology services 7,052 51.3 5,396 48.0 30.7\nResearch and development 2,887 21.0 2,304 20.5 25.3\nSales and marketing 1,692 12.3 1,574 14.0 7.5\nGeneral and administrative 2,398 17.4 2,154 19.1 11.3\nTotal costs and operating expenses 14,029 102.1 11,428 101.6 22.8\nIncome from operations $ (284) (2.1) % $ (175) (1.6) % 62.3 %\nOncology Services Revenue\nOncology services revenue, which is primarily derived from pharmacology studies, was $13.7 million and $11.3 million\nfor the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, an increase of $2.5 million or 22.1%. The increase in revenue\nwas primarily due to the expansion of our platform and offerings creating demand for our services and leading to larger\npharmacology studies in both our in-vivo and ex-vivo platforms.\nCost of Oncology Services\nCost of oncology services for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 were $7.1 million and $5.4 million,\nrespectively, an increase of $1.7 million or 30.7%. The increase in cost of oncology services was primarily from compensation,\nmice and supply expenses resulting from larger study sizes and compensation expense for our SaaS platform. For the three\nmonths ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, gross margins were 48.7% and 52.0%, respectively. The lower margin resulted from an\n19\nincrease in study related expenses in advance of the revenue recognition. Additionally, SaaS costs were expensed during the\nthree months ended July 31, 2022 compared to capitalized during the three months ended July 31, 2021.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2.9 million and $2.3\nmillion, respectively, an increase of approximately $583,000 or 25.3%. The increase for the three-month period was mainly due\nto compensation and lab supply expense related to the investment in our therapeutic drug discovery platform.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1.7 million and $1.6 million,\nrespectively, an increase of $118,000, or 7.5%. The increase was mainly due to compensation expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2.4 million and $2.2\nmillion, an increase of $244,000, or 11.3%. General and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of compensation,\ninsurance, professional fees, IT, and depreciation and amortization expenses. The increase was mainly due to an increase in IT\nrelated expenses to support the overall infrastructure growth of the company.\nCash Flows\nThe following discussion relates to the major components of our cash flows:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $195,000 compared to net cash provided by operations of $216,000 for the three\nmonths ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The cash used in operating activities during the current period was\nprimarily due to reduction in accounts payable and accrued liability balances.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $754,000 and $907,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The cash used in investing activities was primarily for the investment in additional lab and computer equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $0 for the three months ended July 31, 2022 compared to cash used by\nfinancing activities $2,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2021. The decrease on cash provided by financing is related to\ndecrease in stock options exercise activity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States requires management to apply methodologies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates of the Company\ninclude, among other things, accounts receivable realization, revenue recognition (replacement of licensed tumors), valuation\nallowance for deferred tax assets, valuation of goodwill, and stock compensation and warrant assumptions. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates. The Company’s critical accounting policies are summarized in the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, filed with the SEC on July 22, 2022.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, see Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\" in the accompanying Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report on Form 10-Q.\n20\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations. We have no transactions or obligations with related parties that\nare not disclosed, consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position. We do not guarantee\nany third-party debt.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nIt is management’s responsibility to establish and maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive\nOfficer and our Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures\nas of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures.\nManagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment\nin evaluating the relationship between the benefit of desired controls and procedures and the cost of implementing new controls\nand procedures.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022. Based on\nthat assessment, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of July 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level in ensuring that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange\nCommission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer\nand our Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Further, management\nconcluded that our consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods presented, in\nconformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rule\n13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n21\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.
