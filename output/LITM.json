Five of the eight drill holes within the area historically known as the Main Uranium Occurrence intersected uranium mineralization observable as carnotite in the drill chips.\n\nMineralization was confirmed with the downhole gamma spectrometer probe that was undertaken on each drill hole by TerraTec Namibia, an independent geophysics consultant that specializes in downhole probing for uranium exploration.\n\nThe geology of the twinned drill holes correlates to the lithologies reported in the historical drill logs of Gencor from the exploration work undertaken by them in the 1970’s. Sampling was undertaken on each meter interval, and samples from the first two drill holes have been submitted to ALS for wet chemical analysis.\n\n**Downhole Probe**\n\nEquivalent uranium oxide (eU3O8) is calculated from data collected using a Gamma Ray Spectrometer probe – GRS 1128 (the “**Probe** “), a downhole tool. The reader is cautioned that Snow Lake uses eU3O8 calculations as a preliminary indication for chemical grades that have yet to be confirmed by chemical assays. Snow Lake considers all eU3O8 readings below 50 ppm as background radioactivity, and not mineralised ground.\n\n**Nuclear Energy and Uranium**\n\n  * _Why Nuclear_ : Nuclear energy provides clean, zero-carbon, zero-emissions, reliable base-load, scalable low-cost energy with greater generating capacity per land footprint than other fuel sources\n\n\n  * _Primary Use of Uranium_ : Uranium is used primarily to produce fuel for nuclear power plants for the generation of electricity\n\n\n  * _Electrification & AI: _Global electricity demand is estimated to grow by approximately 50% by 2040, driven in large part by the growth in data centers to support artificial intelligence (AI), cloud storage and social media\n\n\n  * _Technology Companies & AI_: Google, Microsoft and Amazon are among the technology companies turning to and investing in nuclear energy to power their energy intensive AI ambitions, including Amazon’s recent $500 million investment2\n\n\n  * _Shortfall of Primary Uranium Supply_ : Current uranium supply will not meet forecasted uranium demand over the next decade. New sources of primary uranium supply will need to be developed to meet this demand\n\n\n\n**Namibia**\n\nNamibia is currently the world’s third-largest producer of uranium, accounting for 11% of global production in 2022[3] from three currently operating uranium mines: Rossing, Husab and Langer Heinrich. Current uranium mine developments in Namibia include: Deep Yellow Limited progressing the development of its Tumas Uranium Project, with commercial production projected for 2026 and Bannerman Energy Ltd. undertaking early works activities on its Etango Uranium Project as it advances towards a final investment decision.\n\n**Qualified Person**\n\nTechnical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Milton Misihairabgwi _(AusIMM),_ a professional geologist with Namib Geological Services, who is a Qualified Person as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation S-K 1300 rules for resource deposit disclosure.\n\n**About Snow Lake Resources Ltd.**\n\nSnow Lake Resources Ltd., d/b/a Snow Lake Energy, is a Canadian clean energy exploration company listed on (NASDAQ: LITM), with a global portfolio of clean energy mineral projects comprised of two uranium projects and two hard rock lithium projects. The Black Lake Uranium Project is an exploration stage project located in the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan and the Engo Valley Uranium Project is an exploration stage project located in the Skeleton Coast of Namibia. The Shatford Lake Project is an exploration stage project located adjacent to the Tanco tantalum, cesium, and lithium mine in Southern Manitoba, and the Snow Lake Lithium™ Project is an exploration stage project located in the Snow Lake region of Northern Manitoba.\n\nThe current focus of Snow Lake is advancing the exploration of its two uranium projects to supply the raw materials needed for the clean energy transition and emissions free power, while exploration activities on its two lithium projects will remain limited until such time as the lithium market recovers from its current depressed levels.
