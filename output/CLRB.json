(NASDAQ: CLRB), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of cancer, today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We achieved important clinical, operational and commercial corporate objectives during the quarter. We reported topline results from the CLOVER-WaM pivotal study in WM and look forward to filing our NDA submission with a request for accelerated regulatory approval in the coming months,” said James Caruso, president and CEO of Cellectar Biosciences. “In addition to our lead iopofosine I 131 program, we plan to further advance the value of our phospholipid radioconjugate pipeline and are preparing alpha and Auger PRCs for initiation of solid tumor clinical studies as business conditions allow.”\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * Reported positive results from the Phase 2 CLOVER-WaM pivotal study evaluating iopofosine I 131, the company’s potentially first-in-class, targeted radiotherapeutic candidate, for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM). These results support the company’s planned filing of the New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the near term.\n  * Selected to present data from the CLOVER-WaM study evaluating iopofosine I 131 in patients with WM at the upcoming 66th Annual American Society of Hematology Meeting and Exposition (ASH), in an oral presentation session. Details of the oral presentation are as follows: \n    * Abstract Title: Iopofosine I 131 in Previously Treated Patients with Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (WM): Efficacy and Safety Results from the International, Multicenter, Open-Label Phase 2 Study (CLOVER-WaM™)\n    * Session Name: 623. Mantle Cell, Follicular, Waldenstrom’s, and Other Indolent B Cell Lymphomas: Clinical and Epidemiological: Clinical Trials for Marginal Zone Lymphoma, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia and Hairy Cell Leukemia\n    * Session Date: Monday, December 9, 2024\n    * Presentation Time: 3:15 PM PST\n  * Delivered oral and poster presentations at the 12th International Workshop on Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) in October 2024 that highlighted the activity of iopofosine I 131 in WM. \n    * Oral presentation: Session XXII Clinical Trials in Progress for WM: Multi-center trial of iopofosine I-131 in relapsed/refractory WM\n    * Poster presentation: Treatment With iopofosine I 131 in a Patient With Bing-Neel Syndrome, A Rare Manifestation of Waldenström Macroglobulinemia: A Case Report\n  * Advanced sales, marketing and medical planning activities to support iopofosine I 131 commercialization\n  * Partnered with key national and regional community cancer networks to better understand the WM disease landscape, to advance iopofosine I 131 for WM patients in the community setting\n  * Established collaboration with the City of Hope Cancer Center to evaluate iopofosine I 131 in mycosis fungoides, a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma\n  * Executed supply and manufacturing agreements, further strengthening our multi-sourced supply network: \n    * Commercial finished product supply of iopofosine I 131 with SpectronRx\n    * Pre-clinical and clinical supply of alpha-emitting actinium 225 isotope with Northstar Medical Radioisotopes\n  * Raised $19.4 million through warrant exercises and issued new milestone-based warrants with the potential to raise up to an additional $73.3 million. Funds generated from the execution of these new warrants will further advance the company’s commercialization plans for iopofosine I 131 in the treatment of WM and support future clinical development.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** As of September 30, 2024, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $34.3 million, including 19.4 million ($17.5 million, net) raised through investor exercises of Tranche B warrants and the purchase of new warrants in July 2024, compared to $9.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The company believes its cash balance as of September 30, 2024, is adequate to fund its basic budgeted operations into the second quarter of 2025.\n  * **Research and Development Expenses:** R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $5.5 million, compared to approximately $7.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decrease was primarily a result of the conclusion of patient enrollment in our WM pivotal study having occurred earlier in the year, partially offset by increased activity in our ongoing pediatric trial and an increase in personnel.\n  * **General and Administrative Expenses:** G&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $7.8 million, compared to approximately $2.4 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by costs associated with the development of infrastructure necessary to support commercialization upon anticipated NDA approval, including the related marketing and personnel cost. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call & Webcast Details**Cellectar management will host a conference call and webcast today, November 18, 2024, at 8:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss these results and answer questions.

The overall decrease was\nprimarily a result of the conclusion of patient enrollment in our WM pivotal study having\noccurred earlier in the year, partially offset by increased activity in our ongoing\npediatric trial and an increase in personnel.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: G&A expenses for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, were approximately $7.8 million, compared to approximately $2.4\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by costs\nassociated with the development of infrastructure necessary to support\ncommercialization upon anticipated NDA approval, including the related marketing and\npersonnel cost.\nConference Call & Webcast Details\nCellectar management will host a conference call and webcast today, November 18, 2024,\nat 8:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss these results and answer questions.

Accordingly, these statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them. Forward-looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Any forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the factors discussed throughout this quarterly report.\n\nYou should read this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. You should assume that the information appearing in this report is accurate as of the date hereof only. Because the risk factors referred to herein could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\n\nThis quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains trademarks and service marks of Cellectar Biosciences, Inc.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION \n\nCellectar Biosciences, Inc. (the Company) is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of cancer, leveraging the Company’s proprietary phospholipid drug conjugate™ (PDC™) delivery platform that specifically targets cancer cells and delivers improved efficacy and better safety as a result of fewer off-target effects.\n\nGoing Concern — As an emerging growth company, the Company has, by design, incurred significant recurring losses and used net cash in its operations since its inception as it devotes substantially all of its efforts towards researching, developing and seeking approval for its product candidates to be commercialized in the marketplace. As a result of these efforts, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $244,987,000 as of September 30, 2024, and incurred a net loss of approximately $42,226,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company expects it will continue to generate significant losses and use net cash for the foreseeable future, until such time that one or more of its product candidates are approved and successfully commercialized in the marketplace. While management believes one or more of the Company’s product candidates will be approved and successfully commercialized in the marketplace, no assurance can be provided any products will be approved or commercialized in a profitable manner.\n\nTo fund its research, development, and approval efforts, the Company has been heavily dependent on funding from private investors and public stockholders since its inception through the issuance of securities, such as common stock, convertible preferred stock, and warrants (outside capital). The Company expects to remain heavily dependent on outside capital to fund the Company’s operations for the foreseeable future until such time that one or more of its product candidates are approved and successfully commercialized in the marketplace. While management believes additional outside capital will be secured as needed, no assurance can be provided that additional outside capital will be secured, or secured on terms that are acceptable to the Company.\n\nAs of the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were issued (the “issuance date”), the Company’s available liquidity to fund the Company’s operations over the next twelve months beyond the issuance date was limited to approximately $28.6 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Absent further action taken by management to increase its liquidity, the Company may be unable to fund its operations under normal course beyond the second quarter of 2025. To improve the Company’s liquidity, management plans to secure additional outside capital via the sale of equity and/or debt securities or execute a strategic transaction. Management also plans to preserve liquidity, as needed, by implementing temporary cost saving measures. While management believes their plans will be successful, no assurance can be provided such plans will be effectively implemented over the next twelve months beyond the issuance date. In the event management’s plans are not effectively implemented, the Company will be required to seek other alternatives which may include, among others, the sale of the Company or its assets, discontinuance of certain operations, a wind-down of operations and/or filing for bankruptcy protection. \n\nThese uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates it will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Cellectar Biosciences, Inc. in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Management believes the disclosures made in this document are adequate with respect to interim reporting requirements.\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023, has been derived from the Company’s audited financial statements. The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Cash Flows, and the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related interim information contained within the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions, rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and the notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are of a nature necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, and consolidated results of its operations, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company’s Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on October 29, 2024.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consists of one reportable segment.\n\nUse of Estimates — The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the assumptions used in the accrual for potential liabilities, the valuation of the warrant liability, the valuation of debt and equity instruments, the valuation of stock options issued for services, and deferred tax valuation allowances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nProperty, Plant & Equipment — Property, plant & equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (3 to 10 years). Leasehold improvements are depreciated over 64 months (their estimated useful life), which represents the full term of the lease at the time the leasehold improvements were capitalized. The Company’s only long-lived assets are property, plant & equipment and right-of-use (ROU) assets. Periodically, and at a minimum annually, the Company evaluates long-lived assets for potential impairment. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Such analyses necessarily involve judgement. The Company did not experience any events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable as of September 30, 2024. There were no fixed asset impairment charges recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\n\nRight-of-Use (ROU)Asset and Lease Liabilities -The Company accounts for all material leases in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases. ROU Assets are amortized over their estimated useful life, which represents the full term of the lease. See Note 8.\n\nStock-Based Compensation — The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards. The resulting compensation expense, net of forfeitures for awards that are not performance-based, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, ranged from twelve months to three years.\n\nResearch and Development — Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes revenue and cost reimbursements from government grants when it is probable that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to the grant arrangement and the grant proceeds will be received. Government grants are recognized on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognizes the related costs for which the government grant is intended to compensate. Specifically, when government grants are related to reimbursements for cost of revenues or operating expenses, the government grants are recognized as a reduction of the related expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company records government grants receivable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIncome Taxes — Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management has provided a full valuation allowance against the Company’s gross deferred tax asset. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing tax returns are required to be evaluated to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed not to meet a more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as tax expense in the current year. There are no uncertain tax positions that require accrual to or disclosure in the financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments — The guidance under ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of certain financial instruments. Financial instruments in the accompanying financial statements consist of cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and long-term obligations. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other current assets and accounts payable approximate their fair value as a result of their short-term nature. (See Notes 2 and 3)\n\nWarrants — The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a fundamental transaction outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding (see Note 2). If the warrants are liability-classified, valuation changes, as well as the cost to issue the warrants, are included in Other Income (Expense) in the financial statements (see Note 3). If these instruments are initially classified as either liabilities or equity and a subsequent assessment determines that the classification has changed, the Company reflects that change in the financial statements.\n\nPreferred Stock — The Company accounts for preferred stock based upon their specific terms and the authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, including whether they are freestanding instruments, whether any redemption or conversion aspects exist and how they are required to be settled (particularly if there is a cash settlement aspect), whether they contain characteristics that are predominantly debt-like or equity-like, whether they have embedded derivatives, and if they have redemption features. Based upon analysis of these criteria, the preferred stock will be classified as either debt, temporary (or “mezzanine”) equity, or permanent equity. The resultant classification is then evaluated quarterly to determine whether any change to the classification is required.\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk — Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents on deposit with financial institutions. The Company’s excess cash as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is on deposit in interest-bearing accounts with well-established financial institutions. At times, such amounts may exceed the FDIC insurance limits. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, uninsured cash balances totaled approximately $33,814,000 and $9,123,000, respectively.\n\nGovernment Assistance — Reimbursements of eligible expenditures pursuant to government assistance programs are recorded as reductions of operating costs when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to the grant arrangement and when the reimbursement has been claimed. The determination of the amount of the claim, and accordingly the receivable amount, requires management to make calculations based on its interpretation of eligible expenditures in accordance with the terms of the programs. The reimbursement claims submitted by the Company are subject to review by the relevant government agencies. The Company currently has a cancer treatment research award through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) totaling approximately $2.0 million over a period of approximately three years. In September 2022, the Company was awarded $1.98 million in additional grant funding to expand the Company’s ongoing Phase 1 study of iopofosine I 131 in children and adolescents with inoperable relapsed or refractory high-grade gliomas (HGGs). The grant was awarded by the NCI based upon the initial signals of efficacy in the Phase 1 study, which is an international, open-label, dose escalation, safety study. The funding allows for an expansion from Part 1a into the Part 1b portion of the ongoing Phase 1 pediatric study.\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company received approximately $602,000 and $1,314,000 in NCI grant funding under the grants described above, respectively, all of which was reported as a reduction of research and development expenses.\n\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted — In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. Public business entities are required to adopt this standard for annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The amendments in this update expand segment disclosure requirements, including new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment among other disclosure requirements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2023 - 07 will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The amendments in ASU 2024-03 address investor requests for more detailed expense information and require additional disaggregated disclosures in the notes to financial statements for certain categories of expenses that are included on the face of the income statement. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company evaluates all ASUs issued by the FASB for consideration of their applicability to the financial statements. The Company has assessed all ASUs issued but not yet adopted and concluded that those not disclosed are not relevant to the Company or are not expected to have a material impact.\n\nRestatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements — During the third quarter of 2024 the Company determined that it was necessary to re-evaluate its accounting treatment for certain previously issued warrants and preferred stock. Additionally, the Company identified certain operating costs previously presented as research and development expenses which are more appropriately classified as general and administrative. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 (SAB No. 99) Topic 1.M, “Materiality” and SAB No. 99 Topic 1.N “Considering the Effects of Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements,” the Company assessed the materiality of these errors to its previously issued consolidated financial statements. Based upon the Company’s evaluation of both quantitative and qualitative factors, the Company concluded the errors were material to the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, as well as those for the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, this Form 10-Q presents the Company’s Restated Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as reflected in the Company’s Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n​\n\n2. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n\nJuly 2024 Warrant Inducement\n\nOn July 21, 2024, the Company, entered into a warrant exercise inducement (the “Inducement”) with certain holders of its September 2023 Tranche B warrants, pursuant to which the holders agreed to exercise the warrants to purchase 1,610 shares of the Company’s Series E-4 Convertible Voting Preferred Stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Series E-4 preferred stock”) which is convertible to 6,739,918 shares of the Company’s common stock in the aggregate, at a reduced, as-converted common stock price of $2.52 per share, in exchange for the Company’s issuance of new warrants (the “Inducement Warrants”), with varying termination dates and exercise prices. The Company received gross proceeds of $19.4 million and net proceeds of $17.5 million.\n\nThe Inducement Warrants have the following terms:\n\n●| The 2024 Tranche A warrants have an exercise price of $2.52 and expire at the earlier of (i) ten (10) trading days following the date of the Company’s public announcement that the FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date for review of iopofosine I 131, and (ii) July 21, 2029.  \n---|---  \n  \n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| The 2024 Tranche B warrants have an exercise price of $4.00 and expire at the earlier of (i) ten (10) trading days following the date of the Company’s public announcement of its receipt of written approval from the FDA of its New Drug Application for iopofosine I 131, and (ii) July 21, 2029.  \n---|---  \n●| The 2024 Tranche C warrants have an exercise price of $5.50 and expire at the earlier of (i) ten (10) trading days following the date of the Company’s public announcement that it has recorded quarterly gross revenues from sales of iopofosine I 131 in the United States in excess of $10 million and (ii) July 21, 2029.  \n---|---  \n  \nDue to a cash settlement feature that requires cash settlement in event of a fundamental transaction that is outside the Company’s control resulting in a form of settlement inconsistent with that which would be received by other security holders, the warrants do not qualify under the equity classification guidance. As a result, and in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815, the warrants issued in July 2024 are deemed to be liabilities. All such liabilities are required to be presented at fair value, with changes reflected in financial results for the period. See Note 3 for the related valuation.\n\nIn accordance with the guidance above, the Company recorded the Inducement Warrants and preferred stock at their respective fair values. Utilizing valuation techniques described in Note 3 below, the Company computed the fair value of the Inducement Warrants as $12.0 million and recorded the preferred stock at approximately $15.9 million, which represented its fair value of $17.0 million less allocated issuance costs. The value of the preferred stock and Inducement Warrants sold exceeded the proceeds received by the Company and the fair value of the Tranche B warrants that were exercised in the transaction, which was approximately $2.6 million at the time of exercise. The value in excess of the net proceeds and the fair value of the Tranche B warrants of approximately $7.7 million is reflected in Other Expense.\n\nSubsequent to the issuance of the Series E-4 preferred stock and prior to September 30, 2024, investors who held 896.00 shares of Series E-4 preferred stock converted them into 3,750,909 shares of common stock. There remain 714.00 shares of Series E-4 preferred stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\nSeptember 2023 Private Placement\n\nOn September 8, 2023, in a private placement with certain institutional investors, the Company issued 1,225 shares of Series E-1 preferred stock, along with Tranche A warrants to purchase 2,205 shares of Series E-3 preferred stock and Tranche B warrants to purchase 1,715 shares of Series E-4 preferred stock. Shares of Series E preferred stock were issued at a fixed price of $20,000 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $24.5 million and net proceeds of approximately $22.2 million after placement agent fees and other customary expenses.\n\nThe conversion prices for the preferred stock are as follows: for the Series E-1 or E-2 preferred stock, $1.82 per share of common stock, or a total of 13,461,538 shares of common stock; for the Series E-3 preferred stock, $3.185 per share of common stock, or a total of 13,846,154 shares of common stock; and for the Series E-4 preferred stock, $4.7775 per share of common stock, or a total of 7,179,487 shares of common stock, in each case subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization. The warrants were exercisable as follows:\n\n●| Tranche A warrants, for an aggregate exercise price of $44.1 million, exercisable for Series E-3 preferred stock until the earlier of September 6, 2026, or 10 trading days after the Company’s announcement of positive topline data from the Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia CLOVER WaM pivotal trial; and,  \n---|---  \n●| Tranche B warrants, for an aggregate exercise price of $34.3 million, exercisable for Series E-4 preferred stock until the earlier of September 6, 2028, or 10 days following the Company’s public announcement of its receipt of written approval from the FDA of its New Drug Application for iopofosine I 131.  \n---|---  \n  \nAs of December 31, 2023, the Tranche A and Tranche B warrants did not qualify as derivatives; however, they did not meet the requirements necessary to be considered indexable in the Company’s stock. As a result, and in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC 815, the warrants were deemed to be liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Tranche B warrants do not qualify as derivatives and meet the requirements necessary to be considered indexable in the Company’s stock. However, due to a cash settlement feature that requires cash settlement in event of a fundamental transaction that is outside the Company’s control resulting in a form of settlement inconsistent with that which would be received by other security holders, the warrants do not qualify under the equity classification guidance. As a result, and in accordance with the guidance in ASC 815, the Tranche B warrants continue to be deemed \n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nliabilities. All such liabilities are required to be presented at fair value, with changes reflected in financial results for the period. As discussed above, the majority of the Tranche B warrants were exercised in July 2024. See Note 3 for the related valuation.\n\nWhen issued, the Series E-1 preferred stock had a redemption feature; therefore, it was classified as mezzanine equity as of September 30, 2023. The Series E-1 preferred stock also had a liquidation preference, which was calculated as an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) two times (2X) the Original Per Share Price, together with any declared, unpaid dividends, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series E-1 preferred stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation. While the Series E-1 preferred was outstanding, this resulted in both the Tranche A and Tranche B warrants being considered puttable by virtue of the liquidation preference impacting the disposition of these warrants in the event of a liquidation. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 480, a puttable warrant is deemed to be a liability. These features only applied to the Series E-1 preferred stock when it was outstanding; upon stockholder approval of the transaction, which was obtained by the Company at a special meeting of stockholders held on October 25, 2023, the Series E-1 preferred stock immediately converted into either Series E-2 preferred stock and/or common stock, dependent upon the beneficial ownership position of the holder.\n\nThe net proceeds from the September 2023 Private Placement were allocated first to the fair value of the Tranche A and Tranche B warrants, which had a fair value upon issuance of $4,800,000, with the remainder, or $17,820,000, allocated to the Series E-1 preferred stock. Upon stockholder approval of the transaction, the entire amount that had been assigned to mezzanine equity was reclassified to Series E-2 preferred stock and is a component of permanent equity, as is reflected in the financial statements. As a result of the stockholder approval, Series E-1 preferred stock was fully extinguished in accordance with the terms of the financing. The outstanding shares of Series E preferred stock were classified as permanent equity upon issuance.\n\nSeries E preferred stock is convertible to common stock at the request of the holder, subject to the holder not exceeding certain beneficial ownership percentages as stipulated in the financing agreement. Subsequent to the issuance of the Series E-2 preferred stock and prior to December 31, 2023, preferred holders converted 905.24 shares of preferred stock into 9,947,684 shares of common stock at the stated rate of $1.82 per common share, resulting in 319.76 shares of Series E-2 preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 170.16 shares of Series E-2 preferred stock were converted into 1,869,890 shares of common stock. There remain 149.60 shares of Series E-2 preferred stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\nIn January 2024, the Company released topline data from its pivotal, Phase 2b CLOVER WaM trial. In accordance with the terms of the Tranche A warrant, the warants’ expiration accelerated to 10 trading days after the topline data release. Warrant holders exercised the Tranche A warrants in their entirety, resulting in the Company issuing 2,205.00 shares of Series E-3 preferred stock, which are convertible to common stock at the stated rate of $3.185 per share, and receiving gross proceeds of $44.1 million and net proceeds of $42.8 million (see Note 3).\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, investors who held 2,002.50 shares of Series E-3 preferred stock converted them into 12,574,557 shares of common stock. There remain 202.50 shares of Series E-3 preferred stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024.\n\nOctober 2022 Public Offering and Private Placement\n\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company completed a registered direct offering of 3,275,153 shares of the Company’s common stock at $2.085 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,275,153 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules. In a separate concurrent private placement transaction, the Company offered and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,875,945 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,875,945 shares of common stock. The warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $1.96 per share and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the closing date. Each pre-funded warrant had a purchase price of $2.08499, is immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.00001 per share and will not expire until exercised in full. The registered direct offering and private placements resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $10.7 million with net proceeds to the Company of approximately $9.6 million after deducting estimated offering expenses.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,079,132 pre-funded warrants were converted into 1,079,132 shares of common stock, and 547,177 warrants issued in October 2022 were exercised for net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million. There were no such conversions or exercises in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nWarrants\n\nThe following table summarizes information with regard to outstanding warrants to purchase stock as of September 30, 2024:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Number of Common**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Shares Issuable**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Upon Exercise of**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Outstanding**|  ​| **Exercise**|  ​| ​  \n**Offering**| **Warrants**| **Price**| **Expiration Date**|  ​  \n2024 Tranche A Warrants| ​|  6,739,918| ​| $| 2.52| ​| July 21, 2029| ​  \n2024 Tranche B Warrants| ​|  8,214,278| ​| $| 4.00| ​| July 21, 2029| ​  \n2024 Tranche C Warrants| ​|  4,267,152| ​| $| 5.50| ​| July 21, 2029| ​  \n2023 Tranche B Preferred Warrants| ​|  439,560| ​| $| 4.7775| ​| September 8, 2028| ​  \n2022 Common Warrants| ​|  4,201,044| ​| $| 1.96| ​| October 25, 2027| ​  \nJune 2020 Series H Common Warrants| ​|  720,796| ​| $| 12.075| ​| June 5, 2025| ​  \nOctober 2017 Series D Common Warrants| ​|  31,085| ​| $| 178.00| October 14, 2024| ​  \nTotal|  24,613,833| ​| ​  \n  \n​\n\nAll warrants in the table above are liability-classified.\n\n​\n\n3. FAIR VALUE\n\nIn accordance with the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of ASC 820, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities generally measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded, and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value:\n\n●| Level 1: Input prices quoted in an active market for identical financial assets or liabilities.  \n---|---  \n●| Level 2: Inputs other than prices quoted in Level 1, such as prices quoted for similar financial assets and liabilities in active markets, prices for identical assets, and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  \n---|---  \n●| Level 3: Input prices quoted that are significant to the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities which are not observable or supported by an active market.  \n---|---  \n  \nTo the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. The carrying amounts reported for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have any Level 1 or Level 2 liabilities.\n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nJuly 2024 Warrants\n\nAs part of the July 2024 financing the Company issued Tranche A, B, and C warrants (the 2024 Warrants) to purchase shares of common stock (see Note 2). The fair value of the 2024 warrants was determined using a probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM) with a scenario-based Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes model. The PWERM is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of the Company’s different classes of equity based upon an analysis of future values for the Company, assuming various outcomes. Under both models, assumptions and estimates are used to value the warrants. The Company assesses these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information that impacts the assumptions is obtained. The quantitative elements associated with the inputs impacting the fair value measurement of the 2024 Warrants include the value per share of the underlying common stock, the timing, form and overall value of the expected exits for the stockholders, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and the expected volatility of the Company’s shares. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The Company estimated a 0% dividend yield based on the expected dividend yield and the fact that the Company has never paid or declared cash dividends. Expected volatility was determined based upon the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock.\n\nThe 2024 Warrants are classified within the Level 3 hierarchy because of the nature of these inputs and the valuation technique utilized, and had a fair value of $12,000,000 and $6,900,000 as of July 21, 2024, the date of issuance, and September 30, 2024, respectively, which is included in the warrant liability caption on the accompanying balance sheets.\n\nThe following table summarizes the modified option-pricing assumptions used on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **July 21,**| **September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2024**  \nVolatility| 75.9-82.0| % | 80.6-83.0| %  \nRisk-free interest rate| 4.10-4.20| % | 3.50-3.60| %  \nExpected life (years)| 0.7-5.0| 0.5-4.8| ​  \nDividend|  0| % |  0| %  \n  \n​\n\nSeptember 2023 Warrants\n\nAs part of the September 2023 financing (see Note 2) the Company issued Tranche A and Tranche B warrants (the 2023 Warrants) to purchase shares of preferred stock which, on an as-converted basis, represented an aggregate of 21,025,641 shares of common stock. The fair value of the Tranche A and B warrants was determined using a probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM) with a scenario-based Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes model. The PWERM is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of the Company’s different classes of equity based upon an analysis of future values for the Company, assuming various outcomes. Under both models, assumptions and estimates are used to value the preferred stock warrants. The Company assesses these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information that impacts the assumptions is obtained. The quantitative elements associated with the inputs impacting the fair value measurement of the 2023 Warrants include the value per share of the underlying common stock, the timing, form and overall value of the expected exits for the stockholders, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and the expected volatility of the Company’s shares. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The Company estimated a 0% dividend yield based on the expected dividend yield and the fact that the Company has never paid or declared cash dividends. Expected volatility was determined based upon the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock.\n\nAs previously described, all of the Tranche A warrants were exercised in January 2024. Additionally, in July 2024, the holders of the Tranche B warrants exercised all but 105.00 of the Tranche B warrants outstanding. As a result, those warrants were marked-to-market on July 21, 2024, the date of the exercise and subsequent settlement.\n\nThe 2023 Warrants are classified within the Level 3 hierarchy because of the nature of these inputs and the valuation technique utilized, and had a fair value of $30,000 and $4,200,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is included in the warrant liability caption on the accompanying balance sheets.\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following table summarizes the modified option-pricing assumptions used on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **September 30,**| **December 31,**|  ​  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​  \nVolatility| ​| 81.0-85.0| % | 82.0-83.0| %  \nRisk-free interest rate|  4.41| % | 3.80-5.40| %  \nExpected life (years)| 0.8-4.2| ​| 0.3-4.7| ​  \nDividend|  0| % |  0| %  \n  \n​\n\nAt the time the Tranche A warrants were exercised, their fair value, calculated as the difference between the common stock conversion rate in the Series E-3 preferred stock and the trading price of the stock when the warrants were exercised, was determined to be $4,800,000. Due to the settlement of the Tranche A warrants relieving the Company of any further related obligation, the liability was reclassified to equity in accordance with ASC 815. The Tranche B warrants continue to be classified as a liability due to a cash settlement feature in the agreement.\n\nOctober 2022 Warrants\n\nIn October 2022 the Company issued a total of 5,151,098 common warrants that are immediately exercisable with a five-year life and a strike price of $1.96 for shares of common stock (the 2022 Common Warrants), and 1,875,941 pre-funded warrants (the 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants) to acquire shares of common stock (see Note 6). The 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants are exercisable by the holder upon payment of the par value of the common stock and are classified as Level 2 liabilities as their value is equal to the Company’s common stock value less the par value.\n\nThe fair value of the 2022 Common Warrants was determined by utilizing a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The quantitative elements associated with the inputs impacting the fair value measurement of the 2022 Common Warrants include the value per share of the underlying common stock, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and the expected volatility of the Company’s shares. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining contractual term of the warrants. The Company estimated a 0% dividend yield based on the expected dividend yield and the fact that the Company has never paid or declared cash dividends. Expected volatility was determined based upon the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. These warrants are classified within the Level 3 hierarchy because of the nature of these inputs and the valuation technique utilized. The following table summarizes the assumptions used at each financial reporting date:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**|  ​  \nVolatility| ​|  78.3| % |  81.1| %  \nRisk-free interest rate|  3.58| % |  3.84| %  \nExpected life (years)|  3.1|  3.8| ​  \nDividend|  0| % |  0| %  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the fair market value of the warrants which are classified within the Level 3 fair value hierarchy.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| **Level 3**  \nFair value of Level 3 liabilities as of December 31, 2023| ​| $|  13,131,691  \nChange in warrant fair value| ​| ​|  (4,566,773)  \nIssuance of July 2024 Inducement Warrants| ​| ​|  12,000,000  \nSettlement of 2023 Tranche A Warrants to equity| ​| ​|  (4,800,000)  \nSettlement of 2023 Tranche B Warrants to equity| ​| ​|  (2,610,000)  \nExercise of October 2022 Warrants| ​|  (1,225,676)  \nJune 30, 2024, fair value of Level 3 liabilities| ​| $|  11,929,242  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\n\n2021 Stock Incentive Plans\n\nThe Company maintains the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The Company utilizes stock-based compensation incentives as a component of its employee and non-employee director and officer compensation philosophy. A committee of the Board of Directors determines the terms of the awards granted and may grant various forms of equity-based incentive compensation. Currently, these incentives consist principally of stock options and restricted shares. All outstanding awards under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) remained in effect according to the terms of the 2015 Plan. Any shares that are currently available under the 2015 Plan and any shares underlying 2015 Plan awards which are forfeited, cancelled, reacquired by the Company or otherwise terminated are added to the shares available for grant under the 2021 Plan. \n\nUnder the current stock option award program, all options become exercisable between one and three years after issuance and expire after ten years. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Volatility is based on the Company’s historical common stock volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time. The expected term of stock options granted is based on an estimate of when options will be exercised in the future. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur. No dividends have been recorded historically.\n\nAt the annual meeting of stockholders held on June 14, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan by 7,000,000 to 9,368,900.\n\nThe following table summarizes amounts charged to expense for stock-based compensation related to employee and director stock option grants:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended**  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nEmployee and director stock option grants:| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nResearch and development| ​| $|  309,933| ​| $|  89,172| ​| $|  453,158| ​| $|  227,896  \nGeneral and administrative| ​|  1,224,121| ​|  408,706| ​|  2,334,508| ​|  1,097,945  \nTotal stock-based compensation| ​| $|  1,534,054| ​| $|  497,878| ​| $|  2,787,666| ​| $|  1,325,841  \n  \n​\n\nIn December 2023, the Company granted 2,776,000 contingent, non-statutory stock option awards at an exercise price of $2.65 per share to employees and directors, and in March 2024 the Company granted 200,000 contingent, non-statutory stock option awards at an exercise price of $3.63 and $3.35 per share to our employees. Each of these grants was contingent on approval of an increase in the shares available in the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan that was approved by the stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders held on June 14, 2024. In accordance with the removal of the contingency, the Company began recognizing the expense for these awards in June 2024.\n\n**Assumptions Used in Determining Fair Value**\n\n _Valuation and amortization method_. The fair value of each stock award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated fair value of employee stock options is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the required service period which is generally the vesting period. The estimated fair value of the non-employee options is amortized to expense over the period during which a non-employee is required to provide services for the award (usually the vesting period).\n\n_Volatility._ The Company estimates volatility based on the Company’s historical volatility since its common stock is publicly traded.\n\n_Risk-free interest rate._ The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected term assumption.\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Expected term._ The expected term of stock options granted is based on an estimate of when options will be exercised in the future. The Company applies the simplified method of estimating the expected term of the options, as described in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110, as the historical experience is not indicative of the expected behavior in the future. The expected term, calculated under the simplified method, is applied to groups of stock options that have similar contractual terms. Using this method, the expected term is determined using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options granted. The Company applied the simplified method to non-employees who have a truncation of term based on termination of service and utilizes the contractual life of the stock options granted for those non-employee grants which do not have a truncation of service.\n\n_Forfeitures._ The Company records stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\n\n_Dividends._ The Company has not historically recorded dividends related to stock options.\n\nExercise prices for all grants made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, were equal to the market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.\n\n​\n\n5. INCOME TAXES\n\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”), using the enacted tax rates. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the asset or liability from period to period. The Company did not record a provision or benefit for federal, state or foreign income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 because the Company has experienced losses on a tax basis since inception. Management has provided a full allowance against the value of its gross deferred tax assets in light of the continuing losses and uncertainty associated with the utilization of the NOLs in the future.\n\nThe Company also accounts for the uncertainty in income taxes related to the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The Company follows the applicable accounting guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition related to the uncertainty in income tax positions. No uncertain tax positions have been identified.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n6. NET LOSS PER SHARE\n\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants outstanding during the period. The pre-funded warrants are considered common shares outstanding for the purposes of the basic net loss per share calculation due to the nominal cash consideration and lack of other contingencies for issuance of the underlying common shares. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the dilutive potential common stock equivalents then outstanding. Potential common stock equivalents consist of stock options, warrants, and convertible preferred shares. In accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, diluted earnings per share are the amount of earnings for the period available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period and to each share that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the reporting period. In the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the common warrants issued in October 2022 were dilutive. In all other periods presented, all outstanding warrants were antidilutive.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Periods ended September 30, 2024**| **Three Months**| **Nine Months**  \nNet loss| ​| $|  (14,664,719)| ​| $|  (42,226,073)  \nDilutive effect of warrant liability| ​| ​|  (1,428,355)| ​|  (7,283,786)  \nNet loss allocated to common shares| ​| $|  (16,093,074)| ​| $|  (49,509,859)  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic| ​| ​|  39,335,924| ​|  34,850,441  \nDilutive effect of warrant liability| ​| ​|  458,296| ​|  695,060  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted| ​| ​|  39,794,220| ​|  35,545,500  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet loss per share - diluted| ​| $|  (0.40)| ​| $|  (1.39)  \n  \n​\n\nThe following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share since their inclusion would be antidilutive:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended**  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nWarrants|  20,412,789| ​|  27,148,243| ​|  20,412,789| ​|  27,148,243  \nPreferred shares on an as-converted-into-common-stock basis|  6,015,662| ​|  111,111| ​|  6,015,662|  111,111  \nStock options|  5,359,624| ​|  2,280,756| ​|  5,359,624|  2,280,756  \nTotal potentially dilutive shares|  31,788,075| ​|  29,540,110| ​|  31,788,075|  29,540,110  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n**Legal**\n\nThe Company may be involved in legal matters and disputes in the ordinary course of business. It is not anticipated that the outcome of such matters and disputes will materially affect the Company’s financial statements.\n\n​\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**8. LEASES**\n\n**Operating Lease Liability**\n\nIn June 2018, the Company executed an agreement for office space in the Borough of Florham Park, Morris County, New Jersey to be used as its headquarters (HQ Lease). The HQ Lease commenced upon completion of certain improvements in October 2018.\n\nOn December 30, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended Agreement of Lease of the HQ Lease (Amended HQ Lease), with CAMPUS 100 LLC (the “Landlord”). Under the Amended HQ Lease, which was accounted for as a modification of the initial lease, the Company will continue to lease 3,983 square feet of rentable area on the second floor of a building located at 100 Campus Drive in Florham Park, New Jersey, commencing on March 1, 2023 until April 30, 2029. The Company also has an option to extend the term of the Amended HQ Lease for one additional 60-month period.\n\nUnder the terms of the Amended Lease, the Company Company’s previously paid security deposit of $75,000 will be reduced to $23,566, and the aggregate rent due over the term of the Amended Lease is approximately $918,000, which will be reduced to approximately $893,000 after certain rent abatements. The Company will also be required to pay its proportionate share of certain operating expenses and real estate taxes applicable to the leased premises. After rent abatements, the rent is approximately $11,800 per month for the first year and then escalates thereafter by 2% per year for the duration of the term.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n**Overview**\n\n _You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the unaudited financial information and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis._\n\nWe are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our core objective is to leverage our proprietary phospholipid ether drug conjugate™ (PDC™) delivery platform to develop PDCs that are designed to specifically target cancer cells and deliver improved efficacy and better safety as a result of fewer off-target effects. We believe that our PDC platform possesses the potential for the discovery and development of the next generation of cancer-targeting treatments, and we plan to develop PDCs both independently and through research and development collaborations.\n\nOur lead PDC therapeutic, iopofosine I 131 (iopofosine) is a small-molecule PDC designed to provide targeted delivery of iodine-131 directly to cancer cells, while limiting exposure to healthy cells. We believe this profile differentiates iopofosine from many traditional on-market treatments and radiotherapeutics. Our CLOVER-WaM Phase 2 pivotal study of iopofosine in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM) has completed, and our Phase 2b studies in r/r multiple myeloma (MM) patients and r/r central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) are ongoing. The CLOVER-2 Phase 1a study for a variety of pediatric cancers has concluded and a Phase 1b study in pediatric patients with high grade glioma is enrolling. Additionally, a Phase 1 Investigator-initiated study conducted by the University of Wisconsin Madison of iopofosine I 131 in combination with external beam radiation in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer has also completed. As with all clinical trials, adverse events, serious adverse events or fatalities may arise during a clinical trial resulting from medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted iopofosine Fast Track Designation for lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) and WM patients having received two or more prior treatment regimens, as well as r/r MM and r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Orphan Drug Designations (ODDs) have been granted for LPL/WM, MM, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcomas including rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. Iopofosine was also granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. The European Commission granted ODD to iopofosine for treatment of r/r MM and WM, as well as PRIME designation for WM.\n\nAdditionally, in June 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted us Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) status by the EMA’s Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprise office. SME status allows us to participate in significant financial incentives that include a 90% to 100% EMA fee reduction for scientific advice, clinical study protocol design, endpoints and statistical considerations, quality inspections of facilities and fee waivers for selective EMA pre-and post-authorization regulatory filings, including orphan drug and PRIME designations. We are also eligible to obtain EMA certification of quality and manufacturing data prior to review of clinical data. Other financial incentives include EMA-provided translational services of all regulatory documents required for market authorization, further reducing the financial burden of the market authorization process.\n\nOur product pipeline also includes a PDC-based targeted alpha-emitter therapy utilizing actinium-225 as the payload (CLR121225) currently in IND enabling studies. We are also evaluating other alpha emitting isotopes such as astatine-211 and lead-212 preclinical studies. Additionally, we have preclinical PDC programs seeking to deliver conjugated small molecule chemotherapeutic compounds, oligonucleotides and peptides to solid tumors.\n\nWe have leveraged our PDC platform to establish three ongoing collaborations featuring four unique payloads and mechanisms of action. Through research and development collaborations, our strategy is to generate near-term capital, supplement internal resources, gain access to novel molecules or payloads, accelerate product candidate development, and broaden our proprietary and partnered product pipelines.\n\nOur PDC platform is designed to provide selective delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads to cancerous cells, whether a hematologic cancer or solid tumor; a primary tumor, or a metastatic tumor; and cancer stem cells. The PDC platform’s mechanism of \n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nentry is designed not to rely upon a specific cell surface epitope or antigen as are required by other targeted delivery platforms but rather a unique change in the tumor cell membrane. Our PDC platform takes advantage of a metabolic pathway (beta oxidation) utilized by nearly all tumor cell types in all stages of the tumor cycle. Tumor cells modify the cell membrane to create specific, highly organized microdomains by which to transport lipids and long chain fatty acids into the cytoplasm, as a result of the utilization of this metabolic pathway. Our PDCs are designed to bind to these regions and directly enter the intracellular compartment. This mechanism allows the PDC molecules to accumulate in tumor cells over time, which we believe can enhance drug efficacy. The direct intracellular delivery allows our molecules to avoid the specialized, highly acidic cellular compartment known as lysosomes, which allows a PDC to deliver payloads that previously could not be delivered in this targeted manner. Additionally, molecules targeting specific cell surface epitopes face challenges in completely eliminating a tumor because the targeted antigens are limited in the total number presented on the cell surface, limiting total potential uptake and resulting in heterogenous uptake across the tumor, have longer cycling time from internalization to relocation on the cell surface, again diminishing their availability for binding, and are not present on all of the tumor cells because of the heterogenous nature of cancer cells, further increasing the unequal distribution of the drug across the tumor. This means a subpopulation of tumor cells always exists that cannot be addressed by therapies targeting specific surface epitopes. Additionally, many epitopes utilized are also present on other normal tissue, resulting in off-target toxicities.\n\nBeyond the benefits provided by the mechanism of entry, the PDC platform features include the capacity to link with almost any molecule, provide a significant increase in targeted oncologic payload delivery, a more uniform delivery, and the ability to target virtually all types of tumor cells. As a result, we believe that we can create PDCs to treat a broad range of cancers with the potential to improve the therapeutic index of oncologic drug payloads, enhance or maintain efficacy while also reducing adverse events by minimizing drug delivery to healthy cells, and increasing delivery to cancerous cells and cancer stem cells.\n\nWe employ a drug discovery and development approach that allows us to efficiently design, research and advance drug candidates. Our iterative process allows us to rapidly and systematically produce multiple generations of incrementally improved targeted drug candidates without the expense of having to generate significant compound libraries.\n\nA description of our PDC product candidates follows:\n\n**Clinical Pipeline**\n\nOur lead PDC therapeutic, iopofosine, is a small-molecule PDC designed to provide targeted delivery of iodine-131 directly to cancer cells, while limiting exposure to healthy cells. We believe this profile differentiates iopofosine from many traditional on-market treatments and treatments in development. Iopofosine was recently evaluated in the completed CLOVER-WaM Phase 2 pivotal study in patients with r/r WM, while evaluation is ongoing in a Phase 2b study in r/r MM and CNS lymphoma patients and the CLOVER-2 Phase 1b study for pediatric patients with high grade gliomas. Adverse events across all studies have been largely restricted to fatigue (39%), and cytopenias; specifically, thrombocytopenia (75%), anemia (61%), neutropenia (54%), leukopenia (56%), and lymphopenia (34%). Fatalities have occurred in patients post-treatment with iopofosine.\n\nThe CLOVER-WaM pivotal Phase 2b study completed enrollment of WM patients that have received at least two previous lines of therapy including those that failed or had a suboptimal response to a BTKi therapy in 4Q 2023. Topline safety data was reported on 45 patients meeting the criteria for the mITT population with a data cut-off date of January 3, 2024. Topline efficacy evaluable population (n=41) was defined as patients who were in the mITT and had follow up of at least 60 days post last dose. The CLOVER-WaM study met its primary endpoint with a MRR of 61% (95% confidence interval [44.50%, 75.80%, two-sided p value < 0.0001]) exceeding the agreed-upon statistical hurdle of 20%. The ORR in evaluable patients was 75.6%, and 100% of patients experienced disease control. Responses were durable, with median duration of response not reached and 76% of patients remaining progression free at a median follow-up of eight months. These outcomes exceed real world data, which demonstrate a 4-12% MRR and a duration of response of approximately six months or less despite continuous treatment in a patient population that is less pretreated and not refractory to multiple classes of drugs. Notably, iopofosine monotherapy achieved a 7.3% complete remission (CR) rate in this highly refractory WM population. Iopofosine I 131 was well tolerated and its toxicity profile was consistent with the Company’s previously reported safety data. There were no treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) leading to discontinuation. The rates of Grade 3 or greater TRAEs observed in more than 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia (55%), neutropenia (37%), and anemia (26%). All patients recovered from cytopenias with no reported aplastic sequalae. Importantly, there were no clinically significant bleeding events, and the rate of febrile neutropenia was 2%. There were no treatment-related deaths in the study.\n\nThe CLOVER-1 Phase 2 study met the primary efficacy endpoints from the Part A dose-finding portion, conducted in r/r B-cell malignancies, and is now enrolling an MM and CNSL expansion cohort (Phase 2b). The Phase 2b study will evaluate highly refractory MM patients in triple class, quad- and penta-drug refractory patients, including post-BCMA immunotherapy patients and r/r CNSL \n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\npatients. The initial Investigational New Drug (IND) application was accepted by the FDA in March 2014 with multiple INDs submitted since that time. The Phase 1 study was designed to assess the compound’s safety and tolerability in patients with r/r MM and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and was initiated in April 2015. The study completed enrollment and the final clinical study report is expected in the first half of 2025. Initiated in March 2017, the primary goal of the Phase 2a study was to assess the compound’s efficacy in a broad range of hematologic cancers.\n\nThe CLOVER-2 Phase 1a pediatric study was conducted internationally at seven leading pediatric cancer centers. The study was an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of iopofosine in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancers, including malignant brain tumors, neuroblastoma, sarcomas, and lymphomas (including Hodgkin’s lymphoma). The maximum tolerated dose was determined to be greater than 60mCi/m2 administered as a fractionated dose. CLOVER-2 Phase 1b study is an open-label, international dose-finding study evaluating two different doses and dosing regiments of iopofosine in r/r pediatric patients with high grade gliomas. These cancer types were selected for clinical, regulatory and commercial rationales, including the radiosensitive nature and continued unmet medical need in the r/r setting, and the rare disease determinations made by the FDA based upon the current definition within the Orphan Drug Act.\n\nIn December 2014, the FDA granted ODD for iopofosine for the treatment of MM. In 2018, the FDA granted ODD and RPDD for iopofosine for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. In May 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for iopofosine for the treatment of MM and in July 2019 for the treatment of DLBCL. In September 2019 iopofosine received ODD from the European Union for MM. In December 2019, the FDA and the European Union each granted ODD for iopofosine for the treatment of WM. In September 2023, the European Union granted PRIME designation for iopofosine for the treatment of r/r WM. The FDA granted Fast Track designation for iopofosine for the treatment of r/r LPL and WM in May 2020.\n\nAs the result of iopofosine’s RPDD designation, we may be eligible to receive a priority review voucher (PRV) if the product receives approval for any of the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, or osteosarcoma. The FDA may award PRV to sponsors of a product application for a RPDD that meet its specified criteria. The key criteria to receiving PRV is that the drug be approved for a rare pediatric disease and treat a serious or life-threatening manifestation of the disease or condition that primarily affects individuals under the age of 18. In order to receive a PRV, a sponsor must obtain approval of a “rare pediatric disease product application,” which is a human drug application for prevention or treatment of a rare pediatric disease and which contains no active ingredient, including any ester or salt thereof, that has been approved by the FDA; is deemed eligible for priority review; is submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA); relies on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population and dosages of the drug intended for that population; does not seek approval for an adult indication in the original rare pediatric disease application; and is approved after September 30, 2016. Under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a rare pediatric disease can receive a PRV that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. Additionally, the PRV’s can be exchanged or sold to other companies so that the receiving company may use the voucher. Congress has only authorized the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program until September 30, 2024. However, if a drug candidate receives RPDD before September 30, 2024, it is eligible to receive a voucher if it is approved before September 30, 2026. \n\n**CLOVER-WaM: Phase 2 Pivotal Study in: Patients with r/r Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia**\n\nWe participated in a Type C guidance meeting with the FDA in September 2020. The results of that guidance meeting provided us with an agreed upon path for conducting the CLOVER-WaM study; a single arm, pivotal study in WM patients that have received and relapsed or were refractory to two prior lines of therapy, including having failed or had a suboptimal response to BTKi therapy. WM is a rare, indolent, and incurable form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) that is composed of a patient population in need of new and better treatment options.\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe study enrolled 65 WM patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, failed both lines of therapy including having failed or had a suboptimal response to a BTKi (i.e. ibrutinib). Patients in the trial received 4-doses of iopofosine over two cycles (cycle one: days 1, 15, and cycle two: days 57, 71) with each dose administered as a 15mCi/m2 infusion. The primary endpoint of the trial is major response rate (MRR) defined as a partial response (a minimum of a 50% reduction in IgM) or better in patients that receive a minimum total body dose (TBD) of 60 mCi with secondary endpoints of treatment-free survival (treatment-free remission), duration of response and progression-free survival. An independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) performed an interim safety and futility evaluation on the first 10 patients enrolled. If three of the 10 patients experienced a Clinically Significant Toxicity (CST) then the dose would have been reduced to 12.5 mCi/m2. We believe this design aligned with the feedback received from the FDA during the guidance meeting held in September 2020 and subsequent interactions. The FDA accepted the dose to be tested, our proposal for a safety and futility assessment to be conducted on the first 10 patients, the endpoint to be assessed, the statistical analysis plan and study size of approximately 50 patients in the mITT population (>60mCi TBD). Based upon this agreement, the pivotal study was initiated. The interim futility and safety assessment occurred in 2022 and the iDMC determined the study exceeded the futility threshold and that the CST threshold was not met, therefore the study should continue to enroll with no change to the dosing regimen. The study achieved full enrollment in the fourth quarter 2023 and topline safety data was reported on 45 patients meeting the criteria for the mITT population with a data cut-off date of January 3, 2024. Among mITT patients, median age was 71 years, median IgM level prior to treatment with iopofosine was 2,185, 90% were refractory to either a BTKi (18/36 50%) or anti-CD20 therapy (18/41 40%), with 26.7% multiclass refractory, and 80% of patients were previously treated with a BTKi therapy. Topline efficacy evaluable population (n=41) was defined as patients who were in the mITT and had follow up of at least 60 days post last dose. The CLOVER WaM study met its primary endpoint with a major response rate (MRR) of 61% (95% confidence interval [44.50%, 75.80%, two-sided p value < 0.0001]) exceeding the agreed upon statistical hurdle of 20%. The overall response rate (ORR) in evaluable patients was 75.6%, and 100% of patients experienced disease control. Responses were durable, with median duration of response not reached and 76% of patients remaining progression free at a median follow-up of eight months. These outcomes exceed real world data, which demonstrate a 4-12% MRR and a duration of response of approximately six months or less despite continuous treatment in a patient population that is less pretreated and not refractory to multiple classes of drugs. Notably, iopofosine monotherapy achieved an 7.3% complete remission (CR) rate in this highly refractory WM population. Iopofosine I 131 was well tolerated and its toxicity profile was consistent with the Company’s previously reported safety data. There were no treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) leading to discontinuation. The rates of Grade 3 or greater TRAEs observed in more than 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia (55%), neutropenia (37%), and anemia (26%). All patients recovered from cytopenias with no reported aplastic sequalae. Importantly, there were no clinically significant bleeding events, and the rate of febrile neutropenia was 2%. There were no treatment-related deaths in the study.\n\n**CLOVER-1: Phase 2 Study in Select B-Cell Malignancies**\n\nThe Phase 2 CLOVER-1 study was an open-label study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of CLR 131 in select B-cell malignancies (multiple myeloma (MM), indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), DLBCL, and central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) who have been previously treated with standard therapy for their underlying malignancy. As of March 2022, the study arms for CLL/SLL, LPL/WM, MZL, MCL, and DLBCL were closed. Dosing of patients varied by disease state cohort and was measured in terms of TBD.\n\nIn July 2016, we were awarded a $2,000,000 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research grant to further advance the clinical development of iopofosine. The funds supported the Phase 2 study initiated in March 2017 to define the clinical benefits of iopofosine in r/r MM and other niche hematologic malignancies with unmet clinical need. These niche hematologic malignancies include CLL, SLL, MZL, LPL/WM and DLBCL. The study was conducted in approximately 10 U.S. cancer centers in patients with orphan-designated relapse or refractory hematologic cancers. The planned study enrollment was up to 80 patients.\n\nThe study’s primary endpoint was clinical benefit response (CBR), with secondary endpoints of ORR, PFS, time to next treatment (TtNT), median Overall Survival (mOS), DOR and other markers of efficacy following patients receiving one of three TBDs of iopofosine (<50mCi, ~50mCi and >60mCi), with the option for a second cycle approximately 75-180 days later. Dosages were provided either as a single bolus or fractionated (the assigned dose level split into two doses) given day 1 and day 15. Over the course of the study the dosing regimen of iopofosine advanced from a single bolus dose to two cycles of fractionated administrations of 15 mCi/m2 per dose on days 1, 15 (cycle 1), and days 57, 71 (cycle 2). Adverse events occurring in at least 25% of subjects were fatigue (39%) and cytopenias, specifically, thrombocytopenia (75%), anemia (61%), neutropenia (54%), leukopenia (51%), and lymphopenia (25%). Serious adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of subjects were restricted to thrombocytopenia (9%) and febrile neutropenia (7.5%).\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Phase 2a Study: Patients with r/r Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Cohort**\n\nPatients in the r/r WM cohort all received TBD of ≥ 60 mCi (25 mCi/m2 single bolus, 31.25 mCi/m2 fractionated, 37.5 mCi/m2 fractionated, or two cycles of mCi/m2 fractionated) either as a bolus dose or fractionated. Current data from our Phase 2a CLOVER-1 clinical study show a 100% ORR in six WM patients and an 83.3% major response rate with one patient achieving a complete response (CR), which reached 39 months post-last treatment. While median treatment free survival (TFS), also known as treatment free remission (TFR), and DOR have not been reached, the average treatment TFS/TFR is currently at 330 days. We believe this may represent an important improvement in the treatment of r/r WM as we believe no approved or late-stage development treatments for second- and third-line patients have reported a CR to date. Based on study results to date, patients continue to tolerate iopofosine well, with the most common adverse events being cytopenias and fatigue.\n\n**Phase 2a Study: Patients with r/r Multiple Myeloma Cohort**\n\nIn September 2020, we announced that a 40% ORR was observed in the subset of refractory MM patients deemed triple class refractory who received 60 mCi or greater TBD. Triple class refractory is defined as patients that are refractory to immunomodulatory, proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD38 antibody drug classes. The 40% ORR (6/15 patients) represents triple class refractory patients enrolled in Part A of Cellectar’s CLOVER-1 study and additional patients enrolled in Part B from March through May 2020 and received >60mCi TBD (25 mCi/m2 single bolus, 31.25 mCi/m2 fractionated, 37.5 mCi/m2 fractionated, or two cycles of mCi/m2 fractionated) either as a bolus dose or fractionated. Patients with MM received 40 mg of dexamethasone concurrently beginning within 24 hours of the first CLR 131 infusion. All MM patients enrolled in the expansion cohort are required to be triple class refractory. The additional six patients enrolled in 2020 were heavily pre-treated with an average of nine prior multi-drug regimens. Three patients received a TBD of > 60 mCi and three received less than 60 mCi. Consistent with the data released in February 2020, patients receiving > 60 mCi typically exhibit greater responses. Based on study results to date, patients continue to tolerate iopofosine well, with the most common and almost exclusive treatment-emergent adverse events are cytopenias, such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia.\n\nIn December 2021, we presented data from 11 MM patients from our ongoing Phase 2 CLOVER-1 study in a poster at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. The MM patients were at least triple class refractory (defined as refractory to an immunomodulatory agent, proteasome inhibitor and monoclonal antibody) with data current as of May 2021. Patients had a median of greater than 7 prior therapies with 50% classified as high risk. Initial results in these patients showed an ORR of 45.5%, a CBR of 72.7%, and a disease control rate (DCR) of 100%. Median PFS was 3.4 months. In a subset of five quad/penta drug refractory patients, efficacy increased, demonstrating an ORR of 80% and CBR of 100% in this highly treatment refractory group. The most commonly observed treatment emergent adverse events were cytopenias that included Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (62.5%), anemia (62.5%), neutropenia (62.5%) and decreased white blood cell count (50%). Treatment emergent adverse events were mostly limited to bone marrow suppression in line with prior observations. No patients experienced treatment emergent adverse events of neuropathy, arrhythmia, cardiovascular event, bleeding, ocular toxicities, renal function, alterations in liver enzymes, or infusion-site reactions or adverse events. We continue to enrich the r/r MM patient cohort with patients that are even more refractory, specifically enrolling patients that are quad-class refractory (triple class plus refractory to any of the recent approved product classes) and have relapsed post-BCMA immunotherapy. We reported in the Blood Cancer Journal in August 2022 that iopofosine demonstrated a 50% ORR in patients receiving >60mCi total administered dose (3/6 patients).\n\n**Phase 2a: Patients with r/r non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma Cohort**\n\nIn February 2020, we announced positive data from our Phase 2a CLOVER-1 study in patients with NHL patients were treated with three different doses (<50mCi, ~50mCi and >60mCi TBD. Patients in the r/r NHL cohort received TBD of either ≥ 60 mCi or < 60 mCi (25 mCi/m2 single bolus, 31.25 mCi/m2 fractionated, 37.5 mCi/m2 fractionated, or two cycles of mCi/m2 fractionated) either as a bolus dose or fractionated. Patients with r/r NHL who received <60mCi TBD and the >60mCi TBD had a 42% and 43% ORR, respectively and a combined rate of 42%. These patients were also heavily pre-treated, having a median of three prior lines of treatment (range, 1 to 9) with the majority of patients being refractory to rituximab and/or ibrutinib. The patients had a median age of 70 with a range of 51 to 86. All patients had bone marrow involvement with an average of 23%. In addition to these findings, subtype assessments were completed in the r/r B-cell NHL patients. Patients with DLBCL demonstrated a 30% ORR with one patient achieving a CR, which continues at nearly 24 months post-treatment. The ORR for CLL/SLL and MZL patients was 33%.\n\nBased upon the dose response observed in the Phase 2a study for patients receiving TBDs of 60mCi or greater, we determined that patient dosing of iopofosine in the pivotal study would be >60mCi TBD. Therefore, patients are now grouped as receiving <60mCi or >60mCi TBD.\n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe most frequently reported adverse events in all patients were cytopenias, which followed a predictable course and timeline. The frequency of adverse events did not increase as doses were increased and the profile of cytopenias remained consistent. Importantly, our assessment is that these cytopenias have had a predictable pattern to initiation, nadir and recovery and are treatable. The most common grade ≥3 events at the highest dose (75mCi TBD) were hematologic toxicities including thrombocytopenia (65%), neutropenia (41%), leukopenia (30%), anemia (24%) and lymphopenia (35%). No patients experienced cardiotoxicities, neurological toxicities, infusion site reactions, peripheral neuropathy, allergic reactions, cytokine release syndrome, keratopathy, renal toxicities, or changes in liver enzymes. The safety and tolerability profile in patients with r/r NHL was similar to r/r MM patients except for fewer cytopenias of any grade. Based upon iopofosine being well tolerated across all dose groups, the observed response rate, and especially in difficult to treat patients such as high risk and triple class refractory or penta-refractory, and corroborating data showing the potential to further improve upon current ORRs and durability of those responses, the study has been expanded to test a two-cycle dosing optimization regimen with a target TBD >60 mCi/m2 of iopofosine.\n\nIn May 2020, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for iopofosine in WM in patients having received two or more prior treatment regimens.\n\n**Phase 1 Study in Patients with r/r Multiple Myeloma**\n\nIn February 2020, final results from a multicenter, Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of iopofosine in r/r MM were presented. The trial was designed to evaluate the safety and potential initial efficacy of iopofosine administered in an up to 30-minute I.V. infusion either as a single bolus dose or as a fractionated dose in heavily pretreated MM patients. The study enrolled a total of 26 evaluable patients at three trial sites. For the trial, which used a modified three-plus-three dose escalation design, 15 evaluable patients were dosed in single bolus doses from 12.5mCi/m2 up to 31.25mCi/m2 (TBD 20.35-59.17 mCi) and 11 evaluable patients were dosed in fractionated dosing cohorts of 31.25mCi/m2 to 40mCi/m2 (TBD 54.915-89.107 mCi). An iDMC did not identify dose-limiting toxicities in any cohort. Of the 26 evaluable patients in the trial, a partial response was observed in 4 of 26 patients (15.4%) and stable disease or minimal response in 22 of 26 patients (84.6%), for a disease control rate of 100%. A significant decrease in M-protein and free light chain (FLC) was also observed. \n\nIopofosine in combination with dexamethasone was under investigation in adult patients with r/r MM. MM is an incurable cancer of the plasma cells and is the second most common form of hematologic cancer. Patients had to be refractory to or relapsed from at least one proteasome inhibitor and at least one immunomodulatory agent. The clinical study was a standard three-plus-three dose escalation safety study to determine the maximum tolerable dose. We use the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) definitions of response, which involve monitoring the surrogate markers of efficacy, M protein and FLC. The IMWG defines a PR as a 50% or greater decrease in M protein or to 50% or greater decrease in FLC levels (for patients in whom M protein is unmeasurable). Secondary objectives included the evaluation of therapeutic activity by assessing surrogate efficacy markers, which include M protein, FLC, PFS and OS. All patients were heavily pretreated with an average of five prior lines of therapy. An iDMC assessed the safety of iopofosine up to its planned maximum single, bolus dose of 31.25 mCi/m2 or a TBD of ~63 mCi. The four single dose cohorts examined were: 12.5 mCi/m2 (~25mCi TBD), 18.75 mCi/m2 (~37.5mCi TBD), 25 mCi/m2(~50mCi TBD), and 31.25 mCi/m2(~62.5mCi TBD), all in combination with low dose dexamethasone (40 mg weekly). Of the five patients in the first cohort, four were assessed as achieving stable disease and one patient progressed at Day 15 after administration and was taken off the study. Of the five patients admitted to the second cohort, all five were assessed as achieving stable disease; however, one patient progressed at Day 41 after administration and was taken off the study. Four patients were enrolled to the third cohort, and all were assessed as achieving stable disease. In September 2017, we announced safety and tolerability data for cohort 4, in which patients were treated with a single infusion up to 30-minutes of 31.25mCi/m2 of iopofosine, which was tolerated by the three patients in the cohort. Additionally, all three patients experienced CBR with one patient achieving a partial response (PR). The patient experiencing a PR had an 82% reduction in FLC. This patient did not produce M protein, had received seven prior lines of treatment including radiation, stem cell transplantation and multiple triple combination treatments including one with daratumumab that was not tolerated. One patient experiencing stable disease attained a 44% reduction in M protein. In January 2019, we announced that the pooled mOS data from the first four cohorts was 22.0 months. In late 2018, we modified this study to evaluate a fractionated dosing strategy to potentially increase efficacy and decrease adverse events. \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nCohorts five and six received fractionated dosing of 31.25 mCi/m2(~62.5mCi TBD) and 37.5 mCi/m2 (~75mCi TBD), each administered on day 1 and day 8. Following the determination that all prior dosing cohorts were tolerated, we initiated a cohort seven utilizing a 40mCi/m2 (~95mCi TBD) fractionated dose administered 20mCi/m2 (~40mCi TBD) on days 1 and day 8. Cohort seven was the highest pre-planned dose cohort and subjects have completed the evaluation period. The study completed enrollment and the final clinical study report is expected in the first half of 2022. Adverse events occurring in at least 25% of subjects were fatigue (26%) and cytopenias, specifically, thrombocytopenia (90%), anemia (65%), neutropenia (55%), leukopenia (61%), and lymphopenia (58%). Serious adverse events occurring in greater than two subjects were restricted to febrile neutropenia n=3 (9.7%). \n\nIn May 2019, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for iopofosine in fourth line or later r/r MM. Iopofosine is currently being evaluated in our ongoing CLOVER-1 Phase 2 clinical study in patients with r/r MM and other select B-cell lymphomas. Patients in the study received up to four, approximately 20-minute, IV infusions of iopofosine over 3 months, with doses given 14 days apart in each cycle and a maximum of two cycles. Low dose dexamethasone 40 mg weekly (20mg in patients ≥ 75), was provided for up to 12 weeks. The planned study enrollment was up to 80 patients. Its primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR), with additional endpoints of ORR, PFS, median overall survival (OS) and other markers of efficacy. Over the course of the study the dosing regimen of iopofosine advanced from a single bolus dose to two cycles of fractionated administrations of 15 mCi/m2 per dose on days 1, 15 (cycle 1), and days 57, 71 (cycle 2). Following treatment with iopofosine, approximately 91% of patients experience a reduction in tumor marker with approximately 73% experiencing greater than 37% reduction.\n\n**CLOVER 2: Phase 1 Study in r/r Pediatric Patients with select Solid tumors, Lymphomas and Malignant Brain Tumors**\n\nIn December 2017, the Division of Oncology at the FDA accepted our IND and study design for the Phase 1 study of iopofosine in children and adolescents with select rare and orphan designated cancers. This study was initiated during the first quarter of 2019. In December 2017, we submitted an IND application for r/r pediatric patients with select solid tumors, lymphomas and malignant brain tumors. The Phase 1 clinical study of iopofosine is an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of iopofosine in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory malignant solid tumors (neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma) and lymphoma or recurrent or refractory malignant brain tumors for which there are no standard treatments. Secondary objectives of the study are to identify the recommended efficacious dose of iopofosine and to determine preliminary antitumor activity (treatment response) of iopofosine in children and adolescents. \n\nIn August 2020, based on data on four dose levels from 15mCi/m2 up to 60mCi/m2, the iDMC permitted the beginning of the evaluation of the next higher dose cohort, at 75mCi/m2. The iDMC advised, based upon the initial data, to enrich the 60 mCi/m2 dose level for patients over the age of 10 with HGG and Ewing sarcoma. Changes in various tumor parameters appeared to demonstrate initial response and tumor uptake. This includes patients with relapsed HGGs with over five months of PFS. In November 2020, we announced clinical data providing that iopofosine had been measured in pediatric brain tumors, confirming that systemic administration of iopofosine crosses the blood brain barrier and is delivered into tumors and that the data show disease control in heavily pretreated patients with ependymomas. In November 2021, we announced favorable data on changes in various tumor parameters in a Phase 1 study in children and adolescents with relapsed and refractory high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and soft tissue sarcomas. Pediatric HGGs are a collection of aggressive brain and central nervous system tumor subtypes (i.e. diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, glioblastomas, astrocytomas, ependymomas, etc.) with about 400 new pediatric cases diagnosed annually in the U.S. Children with these tumors have a poor prognosis and limited 5-year survival. Adverse events occurring in at least 25% of subjects were fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting (28% respectively), and cytopenias, specifically, thrombocytopenia (67%), anemia (67%), neutropenia (61%), leukopenia (56%), and lymphopenia (33%). There were no serious adverse events occurring in more than 2 subjects. The Part A portion of this Phase 1 study has concluded, and part B has initiated to determine the appropriate dosing regimen in pediatric patients with r/r HGG. In 2022, the NCI awarded Cellectar a $1,900,000 SBIR Phase 2 grant to explore iopofosine in pediatric HGG.\n\nIn 2018, the FDA granted ODD and RPDD for iopofosine for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. If iopofosine should be approved for any of these pediatric indications, the first approved RPDD would enable us to receive a priority review voucher. Priority review vouchers can be used by the sponsor to receive priority review for a future New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic License Application (BLA) submission, which would reduce the FDA review time from 12 months to six months. Currently, these vouchers can also be transferred or sold to another entity. In December 2020, the FDA extended the Priority Review Voucher Program through September 2026 for rare pediatric diseases.\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Phase 1 Study in r/r Head and Neck Cancer**\n\nIn August 2016, the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) was awarded a five-year Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) grant of $12,000,000 from the NCI and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research to improve treatments and outcomes for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. HNC is the sixth most common cancer across the world with approximately 56,000 new patients diagnosed every year in the U.S. As a key component of this grant, the UWCCC researchers completed testing of iopofosine in various animal HNC models and initiated the first human clinical study enrolling up to 30 patients combining iopofosine and external beam radiation treatment (EBRT) with recurrent HNC in the fourth quarter of 2019. UWCCC has completed the part A portion of a safety and tolerability study of iopofosine in combination with EBRT and preliminary data suggest safety and tolerability in relapsed or refractory HNC. The reduction in the amount or fractions (doses) of EBRT has the potential to diminish the (number and severity of) adverse events associated with EBRT. Patients with HNC typically receive approximately 60-70 Grays (Gy) of EBRT given as 2 – 3 Gy daily doses over a six-week timeframe. Patients can experience long-term tumor control following re-irradiation in this setting; however, this approach can cause severe injury to normal tissue structures, significant adverse events and diminished quality of life. Part B of the study was to assess the safety and potential benefits of iopofosine in combination with EBRT in a cohort of up to 24 patients. This portion of the study has fully enrolled, and data were reported at the ASTRO 2024 conference on March 2, 2024. Complete remission was achieved in 64% of patients, with an ORR of 73% (n=11). Prior to treatment with iopofosine I 131, six patients had multiple recurrence and one had metastatic disease, both of which are indicative of poor outcomes. Additionally, the study demonstrated durability of tumor control with an overall survival of 67% and progression free survival of 42% at 12 months. Eleven patients (92%) experienced a treatment-related adverse event. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurring in 20% or more patients were thrombocytopenia (75%), lymphopenia (75%), leukopenia (75%), neutropenia (67%), and anemia (42%). Observed adverse events were consistent with the known toxicity profile of iopofosine I 131, with cytopenias being the most common. All patients recovered. We believe that these data support the notion of enhanced patient outcomes when combining the use of iopofosine I 131 in combination with external beam radiation for a treatment of solid tumors.\n\n**Preclinical Pipeline**\n\nWe believe our PDC platform has potential to provide targeted delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads, as exemplified by the product candidates listed below, that may result in improvements upon current standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of a broad range of human cancers:\n\n●| CLR 12120 Series is an alpha emitting radio-conjugate program. The company has validated the _in vivo_ potential of alpha emitting phospholipid radioconjugates and their potential to treat highly refractory and difficult to treat solid tumors. Cellectar is currently progressing with a lead molecule using actinium-225 as the alpha emitting payload.  \n---|---  \n●| The company has developed a series of proprietary small molecule phospholipid drug conjugates. These programs employ either novel payload or novel linkers. Many of these molecules have demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in preclinical mouse models. The collaboration with IntoCell Inc. successfully met its agreed upon endpoint. The collaboration provided significant data which has led Cellectar to select a series of highly potent cytotoxic small molecule payloads for further development.  \n---|---  \n●| In collaboration with other parties, Cellectar has also validated that the PLE is capable of delivering peptide payloads and oligonucleotide (siRNA, mRNA, etc.) payloads to the tumors when delivered systemically. These molecules have also been shown to demonstrate activity and safety in multiple preclinical mouse models. Based upon these collaborations and the data, the company has initiated internal proprietary programs with each of these treatment modalities.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Results of Operations**\n\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying, developing and testing, and manufacturing product candidates, which primarily include salaries and related expenses for personnel, cost of manufacturing materials and contract manufacturing fees paid to contract manufacturers and contract research organizations, fees paid to medical institutions for clinical studies, and costs to secure intellectual property. The Company analyzes its research and development expenses based on four categories as follows: clinical project costs, preclinical project costs, manufacturing and related costs, and general research and development costs that are not allocated to the functional project costs, including personnel costs, facility costs, related overhead costs and patent costs.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. Other costs include insurance, costs for public company activities, investor relations, directors’ fees and professional fees for legal and accounting services.\n\nOther income (expense), net**.** Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of the impacts related to issuing and revaluing equity securities, and interest income.\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024****and 2023**\n\n _Research and Development_. Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $5,493,000, compared to approximately $7,035,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table is a summary comparison of approximate research and development costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **Variance**  \nClinical project costs| ​| $|  1,510,000| ​| $|  3,412,000| ​| $|  (1,902,000)  \nManufacturing and related costs| ​|  2,469,000| ​|  2,832,000| ​|  (363,000)  \nPre-clinical project costs| ​|  49,000| ​|  206,000| ​|  (157,000)  \nGeneral research and development costs| ​|  1,465,000| ​|  585,000| ​|  880,000  \n​| ​| $|  5,493,000| ​| $|  7,035,000| ​| $|  (1,542,000)  \n  \n​\n\nThe overall decrease in research and development expense of approximately $1,542,000, or 22%, was primarily a result of decreased clinical project costs of approximately $1,902,000, driven by the conclusion of patient enrollment in our WM pivotal study having occurred earlier in the year, partially offset by increased activity in our ongoing pediatric trial and an increase in personnel.\n\n_General and administrative._ General and administrative expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $7,834,000, compared to approximately $2,379,00 for the same period in 2023. The overall increase in general and administrative expense of approximately $5,455,000, or 229%, was driven by costs associated with the development of infrastructure necessary to support commercialization upon anticipated NDA approval, including the related market preparation and personnel cost.\n\n_Other income (expense),_ _net_. Other income (expense), net, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was an expense of approximately $1,337,000, as compared to approximately $8,107,000 of expense in the same period of 2023, resulting almost exclusively from changes in warrant valuation. Fluctuations in the Company’s common stock price are the primary aspect of warrant valuation changes. Interest income increased year-over-year to approximately $318,000 in 2024 as compared to approximately $51,000 in 2023. The Company’s cash on hand and increased interest rates drove the improved return.\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**\n\n _Research and Development._ Research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $19,927,000, compared to approximately $19,529,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table is a summary comparison of approximate research and development costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Nine Months Ended**|  ​| ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​| **Variance**  \nClinical project costs| ​| $|  8,154,000| ​| $|  10,235,000| ​| $|  (2,081,000)  \nManufacturing and related costs| ​|  8,410,000| ​|  7,007,000| ​|  1,403,000  \nPre-clinical project costs| ​|  101,000| ​|  422,000| ​|  (321,000)  \nGeneral research and development costs| ​|  3,262,000| ​|  1,865,000| ​|  1,397,000  \n​| ​| $|  19,927,000| ​| $|  19,529,000| ​| $|  398,000  \n  \n​\n\nThe overall increase in research and development expenses of approximately $398,000, or 2%, was primarily a result of increased manufacturing and related costs of approximately $1,403,000 related to production sourcing and an increase in general research and development costs related to an increase in personnel. These increases were largely offset by a reduction in clinical project costs of approximately $2,081,000, resulting from the timing of the patient enrollment related to our pivotal WM trial.\n\n_General and administrative_. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was approximately $19,106,000, compared to approximately $6,884,000 for the same period in 2023. The overall increase in general and administrative expense of $12,222,000, or 178%, was primarily driven by costs associated with the development of infrastructure necessary to support commercialization upon anticipated NDA approval, including the related market preparation and personnel costs.\n\n_Other income (expense), net_. Other income (expense), net, for the first nine months of 2024 was an expense of approximately $3,193,000, while the expense for the same period in 2023 was approximately $8,477,000. A significant portion of the expense comes from changes in the valuation of the Company’s outstanding warrants. Warrant valuation consists of a number of aspects, but the most significant driver is the value at which the Comapany’s common stock is trading at the end of each reporting period. Interest income was approximately $967,000 year-to-date in 2024, and approximately $248,000 in 2023. The Company’s improved return on cash equivalents is a product of higher average cash balance and a higher interest rate environment.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nWe have incurred losses since inception in devoting substantially all of our efforts toward research and development of drug candidates for which we are seeking FDA approval. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated a net loss of approximately $42.2 million and used approximately $36.7 million in cash for operations. We expect that we will continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, our consolidated cash balance was approximately $34.3 million. As of the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were issued (the “issuance date”), the Company’s available liquidity to fund the Company’s operations over the next twelve months beyond the issuance date was limited to approximately $28.6 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. Absent further action taken by management to increase its liquidity, the Company may be unable to fund its operations under normal course beyond the second quarter of 2025. To improve the Company’s liquidity, management plans to secure additional outside capital via the sale of equity and/or debt securities or execute a strategic transaction. Management also plans to preserve liquidity, as needed, by implementing temporary cost saving measures. While management believes their plans will be successful, no assurance can be provided such plans will be effectively implemented over the next twelve months beyond the issuance date. In the event management’s plans are not effectively implemented, the Company will be required to seek other alternatives which may include, among others, the sale of assets, discontinuance of certain operations, and/or filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThese uncertainties raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis that the Company will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates it will be able to realize assets and settle liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\n\n​\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\n\n​\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nUnder the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), in connection with the period ending March 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that as of the respective period, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below.\n\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded that the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q/A fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of the year ended December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO Framework”). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, continuing through September 30, 2024, because of the material weaknesses described below.\n\n_Material Weaknesses_\n\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that a reasonable possibility exists that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n\nManagement concluded that material weaknesses existed as of the year ended December 31, 2023. Specifically, management identified deficiencies in the principles associated with the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication and monitoring components of internal control, based on the criteria established by the COSO Framework, that constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate.\n\n●| Control Environment: The Company lacked appropriate policies and resources to develop and operate effective internal control over financial reporting, which contributed to the Company’s inability to properly analyze, record and disclose accounting matters accurately and timely. This was further impacted by the limited number of staff in the Company’s accounting and finance function. This material weakness contributed to additional material weaknesses further described below.  \n---|---  \n●| Risk Assessment: The Company does not have a formal process to identify, update, and assess risks, including risks around the accounting for complex transactions, that could significantly impact the design and operation of the Company’s control activities.  \n---|---  \n  \n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n●| Control Activities: Management did not design and implement effective control activities and identified the following material weaknesses:   \n---|---  \no| Management failed to design and implement adequate internal controls over financial reporting which resulted in the inaccurate accounting of preferred equity and warrants  \n---|---  \no| Management failed to design and implement adequate internal controls over the recording of stock-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock awards granted in December 2023.   \n---|---  \no| Management failed to design and implement adequate internal controls over financial reporting as it relates to the proper fair value methodologies and assumptions used to value financial instruments, specific to the assumptions utilized in the valuation of the preferred warrants.   \n---|---  \n●| Information and Communication: As noted above, the Company had a limited number of staff in its finance and accounting function, and therefore was unable to design and maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the initiation, recording, and approval of transactions within its financial systems. This, coupled with management having not designed and maintained user access controls that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, and the absence of sufficient other mitigating controls, created a segregation of duties deficiencies.  \n---|---  \n●| Monitoring Activities: Management did not appropriately select, develop, and perform ongoing evaluations to ascertain whether the components of internal controls are present and functioning   \n---|---  \n  \nThese material weaknesses resulted in errors that required the restatement of the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, as well as the restatement of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the interim periods ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, and March 31, 2022. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of the account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or timely detected. \n\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses\n\nThe process of designing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is a continuous effort that requires management to anticipate and react to changes in our business, economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources. In early 2024, the Company began recruiting and hired qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel to supplement our level of knowledge and experience with internal control over financial reporting in order to begin to design and implement a formal control environment and risk assessment process. Such process includes identification of risks, the level of detail in our risk assessment, and the clarity of the linkage between risks and internal controls. The results of this effort are expected to enable us to effectively identify, develop, evolve and implement controls and procedures to address risks. Additionally, the Company has also initiated the implementation of an ERP system, which will provide a system-based control structure for all financial transactions. \n\nAs our remediation efforts are still on-going, we will continue to consider the need for additional resources and implement further enhancements to our policies and procedures as necessary to further improve our internal control over financial reporting. As we work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, we may modify our remediation plan and may implement measures as we continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures in the ordinary course. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the remediated controls have been operating for a sufficient period of time and can be evidenced through testing that these are operating effectively.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nExcept for the identification of the material weaknesses described above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n​\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**PART II.

Business.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of\ncancer. Our core objective is to leverage our proprietary phospholipid ether drug conjugate ™ (PDC™) delivery platform to develop PDCs that are\ndesigned to specifically target cancer cells and deliver improved efficacy and better safety as a result of fewer off-target effects. We believe that our PDC\nplatform possesses the potential for the discovery and development of the next generation of cancer-targeting treatments, and we plan to develop PDCs\nboth independently and through research and development collaborations.\nOur lead PDC therapeutic, iopofosine I 131 (iopofosine) is a small-molecule PDC designed to provide targeted delivery of iodine-131 directly to\ncancer cells, while limiting exposure to healthy cells. We believe this profile differentiates iopofosine from many traditional on-market treatments and\nradiotherapeutics. Our CLOVER-WaM Phase 2 pivotal study of iopofosine in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia\n(WM) has completed, and our Phase 2b studies in r/r multiple myeloma (MM) patients and r/r central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) are ongoing. The\nCLOVER-2 Phase 1a study for a variety of pediatric cancers has concluded and a Phase 1b study in pediatric patients with high grade glioma is enrolling.\nAdditionally, a Phase 1 Investigator-initiated study conducted by the University of Wisconsin Madison of iopofosine I 131 in combination with external\nbeam radiation in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer has also completed. As with all clinical trials, adverse events, serious adverse events or\nfatalities may arise during a clinical trial resulting from medical problems that may not be related to clinical trial treatments.\nThe CLOVER-1 Phase 2 study, conducted in r/r B-cell malignancies, met the primary efficacy endpoints from the Part A dose-finding portion. The\nCLOVER-1 Phase 2b study, where iopofosine remains under further evaluation in highly refractory MM and CNSL patients, is ongoing.\nThe CLOVER-WaM study was a pivotal registration study evaluating iopofosine in WM patients that were r/r to at least two prior lines of therapy\nincluding having failed or had a suboptimal response to a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi). The study completed enrollment in the fourth quarter of\n2023, and initial top line data from the study was reported in January 2024. CLOVER-WaM was a single-arm study with a target enrollment of 50 patients.\nTopline safety data was reported on 45 patients meeting criteria for the modified Intent to Treat (mITT) population with a data cut-off date of January 3,\n2024. Topline efficacy evaluable population (41) is defined as patients who are in the mITT and had follow up of at least 60 days post last dose. The\nCLOVER-WaM study met its primary endpoint with a major response rate (MRR) of 61% (95% confidence interval [44.50%, 75.80%, two-sided p value <\n0.0001]) exceeding the FDA agreed-upon statistical hurdle of 20%. The overall response rate (ORR) in evaluable patients was 75.6%, and 100% of\npatients experienced disease control. Responses were durable, with median duration of response not reached and 76% of patients remaining progression\nfree at a median follow-up of eight months. These outcomes exceed real world data, which demonstrate a 4-12% MRR and a duration of response of\napproximately six months or less despite continuous treatment in a patient population that is less pretreated and not refractory to multiple classes of drugs.\nNotably, iopofosine I 131 monotherapy achieved an 7.3% complete remission (CR) rate in this highly refractory WM population. Iopofosine I 131 was\nwell tolerated and its toxicity profile was consistent with the Company's previously reported safety data. There were no treatment-related adverse events\n(TRAEs) leading to discontinuation. The rates of Grade 3 or greater TRAEs observed in more than 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia (55%),\nneutropenia (37%), and anemia (26%). All patients recovered from cytopenias with no reported aplastic sequalae. Importantly, there were no clinically\nsignificant bleeding events, and the rate of febrile neutropenia was 2%. There were no treatment-related deaths in the study.\nThe CLOVER-2 Phase 1a pediatric study was an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of\niopofosine in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory malignant solid tumors (neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and\nrhabdomyosarcoma) and lymphoma or recurrent or refractory malignant brain tumors (high grade glioma, glioblastoma, etc.) for which there are no\nstandard treatments. The study was conducted internationally at seven leading pediatric cancer centers. The CLOVER-2 Phase 1b pediatric study is an\nopen-label, dose finding study evaluating the activity of two different doses and dosing regimens of iopofosine in children and adolescents with r/r\nmalignant brain tumors (high grade gliomas). This study is partially funded (~$2M) by a National Institutes of Health SBIR grant from the National Cancer\nInstitute.\n4\nTable of Contents\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted iopofosine Fast Track Designation for lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) and WM patients\nhaving received two or more prior treatment regimens, as well as r/r MM and r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Orphan Drug Designations\n(ODDs) have been granted for LPL/WM, MM, neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcomas including rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma.\nIopofosine was also granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and\nosteosarcoma. The European Commission granted ODD to iopofosine for treatment of r/r MM and WM, as well as PRIME designation for WM.\nAdditionally, in June 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted us Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) status by the EMA’s\nMicro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprise office. SME status allows us to participate in significant financial incentives that include a 90% to 100% EMA\nfee reduction for scientific advice, clinical study protocol design, endpoints and statistical considerations, quality inspections of facilities and fee waivers\nfor selective EMA pre-and post-authorization regulatory filings, including orphan drug and PRIME designations. We are also eligible to obtain EMA\ncertification of quality and manufacturing data prior to review of clinical data. Other financial incentives include EMA-provided translational services of\nall regulatory documents required for market authorization, further reducing the financial burden of the market authorization process.\nOur product pipeline also includes a PDC-based alpha-emitter radiotherapeutic series (CLR12120) in IND enabling studies, preclinical PDC small\nmolecule chemotherapeutic programs, an oligo-conjugate program, a peptide-conjugate program, and several partnered PDC assets. We are evaluating the\nCLR 12120 series with multiple alpha emitting isotopes, such as actinium and astatine in both solid and hematologic malignancies. The other programs are\nbeing developed for solid tumors.\nWe have leveraged our PDC platform to establish three ongoing collaborations featuring four unique payloads and mechanisms of action. Through\nresearch and development collaborations, our strategy is to generate near-term capital, supplement internal resources, gain access to novel molecules or\npayloads, accelerate product candidate development, and broaden our proprietary and partnered product pipelines.\nOur PDC platform is designed to provide selective delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads to cancerous cells, whether a hematologic cancer\nor solid tumor; a primary tumor, or a metastatic tumor; and cancer stem cells. The PDC platform’s mechanism of entry is designed not to rely upon a\nspecific cell surface epitope or antigen as are required by other targeted delivery platforms but rather a unique change in the tumor cell membrane. Our\nPDC platform takes advantage of a metabolic pathway (beta oxidation) utilized by nearly all tumor cell types in all stages of the tumor cycle. Tumor cells\nmodify the cell membrane to create specific, highly organized microdomains by which to transport lipids and long chain fatty acids into the cytoplasm, as a\nresult of the utilization of this metabolic pathway. Our PDCs are designed to bind to these regions and directly enter the intracellular compartment. This\nmechanism allows the PDC molecules to accumulate in tumor cells over time, which we believe can enhance drug efficacy. The direct intracellular\ndelivery allows our molecules to avoid the specialized, highly acidic cellular compartment known as lysosomes, which allows a PDC to deliver payloads\nthat previously could not be delivered in this targeted manner. Additionally, molecules targeting specific cell surface epitopes face challenges in completely\neliminating a tumor because the targeted antigens are limited in the total number presented on the cell surface, limiting total potential uptake and resulting\nin heterogenous uptake across the tumor, have longer cycling time from internalization to relocation on the cell surface, again diminishing their availability\nfor binding, and are not present on all of the tumor cells because of the heterogenous nature of cancer cells, further increasing the unequal distribution of\nthe drug across the tumor. This means a subpopulation of tumor cells always exists that cannot be addressed by therapies targeting specific surface\nepitopes. Additionally, the epitope utilized is also present on other normal tissue, resulting in off-target toxicities.\nBeyond the benefits provided by the mechanism of entry, the PDC platform features include the capacity to link with almost any molecule, provide a\nsignificant increase in targeted oncologic payload delivery, a more uniform delivery, and the ability to target all types of tumor cells. As a result, we believe\nthat we can create PDCs to treat a broad range of cancers with the potential to improve the therapeutic index of oncologic drug payloads, enhance or\nmaintain efficacy while also reducing adverse events by minimizing drug delivery to healthy cells, and increasing delivery to cancerous cells and cancer\nstem cells.\nWe employ a drug discovery and development approach that allows us to efficiently design, research and advance drug candidates. Our iterative\nprocess allows us to rapidly and systematically produce multiple generations of incrementally improved targeted drug candidates without the expense of\nhaving to generate significant compound libraries.\n5\nTable of Contents\nA description of our PDC product candidates follows:\nClinical Pipeline\nOur lead PDC therapeutic, iopofosine, is a small-molecule PDC designed to provide targeted delivery of iodine-131 directly to cancer cells, while\nlimiting exposure to healthy cells. We believe this profile differentiates iopofosine from many traditional on-market treatments and treatments in\ndevelopment. Iopofosine was recently evaluated in the completed CLOVER-WaM Phase 2 pivotal study in patients with r/r WM, while evaluation is\nongoing in a Phase 2b study in r/r MM and CNS lymphoma patients and the CLOVER-2 Phase 1b study for pediatric patients with high grade gliomas.\nAdverse events across all studies have been largely restricted to fatigue (39%), and cytopenias; specifically, thrombocytopenia (75%), anemia (61%),\nneutropenia (54%), leukopenia (56%), and lymphopenia (34%). Fatalities resulting from infection have occurred in patients treated with iopofosine.\nThe CLOVER-WaM pivotal Phase 2b study completed enrollment of WM patients that have received at least two previous lines of therapy including\nthose that failed or had a suboptimal response to a BTKi therapy in 4Q 2023. Topline safety data was reported on 45 patients meeting the criteria for the\nmITT population with a data cut-off date of January 3, 2024. Topline efficacy evaluable population (n=41) was defined as patients who were in the mITT\nand had follow up of at least 60 days post last dose. The CLOVER-WaM study met its primary endpoint with a MRR of 61% (95% confidence interval\n[44.50%, 75.80%, two-sided p value < 0.0001]) exceeding the agreed-upon statistical hurdle of 20%. The ORR in evaluable patients was 75.6%, and 100%\nof patients experienced disease control. Responses were durable, with median duration of response not reached and 76% of patients remaining progression\nfree at a median follow-up of eight months. These outcomes exceed real world data, which demonstrate a 4-12% MRR and a duration of response of\napproximately six months or less despite continuous treatment in a patient population that is less pretreated and not refractory to multiple classes of drugs.\nNotably, iopofosine monotherapy achieved a 7.3% complete remission (CR) rate in this highly refractory WM population. Iopofosine I 131 was well\ntolerated and its toxicity profile was consistent with the Company's previously reported safety data. There were no treatment-related adverse events\n(TRAEs) leading to discontinuation. The rates of Grade 3 or greater TRAEs observed in more than 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia (55%),\nneutropenia (37%), and anemia (26%). All patients recovered from cytopenias with no reported aplastic sequalae. Importantly, there were no clinically\nsignificant bleeding events, and the rate of febrile neutropenia was 2%. There were no treatment-related deaths in the study.\nThe CLOVER-1 Phase 2 study met the primary efficacy endpoints from the Part A dose-finding portion, conducted in r/r B-cell malignancies, and is\nnow enrolling an MM and CNSL expansion cohort (Phase 2b). The Phase 2b study will evaluate highly refractory MM patients in triple class, quad- and\npenta-drug refractory patients, including post-BCMA immunotherapy patients and r/r CNSL patients. The initial Investigational New Drug (IND)\napplication was accepted by the FDA in March 2014 with multiple INDs submitted since that time. The Phase 1 study was designed to assess the\ncompound’s safety and tolerability in patients with r/r MM and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and was initiated in April 2015. The study\ncompleted enrollment and the final clinical study report is expected in the first half of 2025. Initiated in March 2017, the primary goal of the Phase 2a study\nwas to assess the compound’s efficacy in a broad range of hematologic cancers.\nThe CLOVER-2 Phase 1a pediatric study was conducted internationally at seven leading pediatric cancer centers. The study was an open-label,\nsequential-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of iopofosine in children and adolescents with relapsed or refractory cancers,\nincluding malignant brain tumors, neuroblastoma, sarcomas, and lymphomas (including Hodgkin’s lymphoma). The maximum tolerated dose was\ndetermined to be greater than 60mCi/m2 administered as a fractionated dose. CLOVER-2 Phase 1b study is an open-label, international dose-finding study\nevaluating two different doses and dosing regiments of iopofosine in r/r pediatric patients with high grade gliomas. These cancer types were selected for\nclinical, regulatory and commercial rationales, including the radiosensitive nature and continued unmet medical need in the r/r setting, and the rare disease\ndeterminations made by the FDA based upon the current definition within the Orphan Drug Act.\nIn December 2014, the FDA granted ODD for iopofosine for the treatment of MM. In 2018, the FDA granted ODD and RPDD for iopofosine for the\ntreatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. In May 2019, the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for\niopofosine for the treatment of MM and in July 2019 for the treatment of DLBCL. In September 2019 iopofosine received ODD from the European Union\nfor MM. In December 2019, the FDA and the European Union each granted ODD for iopofosine for the treatment of WM. In September 2023, the\nEuropean Union granted PRIME designation for iopofosine for the treatment of r/r WM. The FDA granted Fast Track designation for iopofosine for the\ntreatment of r/r LPL and WM in May 2020.\nAs the result of iopofosine’s RPDD designation, we may be eligible to receive a priority review voucher (PRV) if the product receives approval for any\nof the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma or osteosarcoma. The FDA may\n6\nTable of Contents\naward PRV to sponsors of a product application for a RPDD that meet its specified criteria. The key criteria to receiving PRV is that the drug be approved\nfor a rare pediatric disease and treat a serious or life-threatening manifestation of the disease or condition that primarily affects individuals under the age of\n18. In order to receive a PRV, a sponsor must obtain approval of a “rare pediatric disease product application,” which is a human drug application for\nprevention or treatment of a rare pediatric disease and which contains no active ingredient, including any ester or salt thereof, that has been approved by\nthe FDA; is deemed eligible for priority review; is submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or section\n351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA); relies on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population and dosages of the drug\nintended for that population; does not seek approval for an adult indication in the original rare pediatric disease application; and is approved after\nSeptember 30, 2016. Under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a rare pediatric disease can receive a PRV that can\nbe redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. Additionally, the PRV’s can be exchanged or sold to\nother companies so that the receiving company may use the voucher. Congress has only authorized the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher\nprogram until September 30, 2024. However, if a drug candidate receives RPDD before September 30, 2024, it is eligible to receive a voucher if it is\napproved before September 30, 2026.\nCLOVER-WaM: Phase 2 Pivotal Study in: Patients with r/r Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia\nWe participated in a Type C guidance meeting with the FDA in September 2020. The results of that guidance meeting provided us with an agreed upon\npath for conducting the CLOVER-WaM study; a single arm, pivotal study in WM patients that have received and relapsed or were refractory to two prior\nlines of therapy, including having failed or had a suboptimal response to BTKi therapy. WM is a rare, indolent, and incurable form of non-Hodgkin’s\nlymphoma (NHL) that is composed of a patient population in need of new and better treatment options.\nThe study enrolled 65 WM patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, failed both lines of therapy including having failed or had a\nsuboptimal response to a BTKi (i.e. ibrutinib). Patients in the trial received 4-doses of iopofosine over two cycles (cycle one: days 1, 15, and cycle two:\ndays 57, 71) with each dose administered as a 15mCi/m2 infusion. The primary endpoint of the trial is major response rate (MRR) defined as a partial\nresponse (a minimum of a 50% reduction in IgM) or better in patients that receive a minimum total body dose (TBD) of 60 mCi with secondary endpoints\nof treatment-free survival (treatment-free remission), duration of response and progression-free survival. An independent data monitoring committee\n(iDMC) performed an interim safety and futility evaluation on the first 10 patients enrolled. If three of the 10 patients experienced a Clinically Significant\nToxicity (CST) then the dose would have been reduced to 12.5 mCi/m2. We believe this design aligned with the feedback received from the FDA during\nthe guidance meeting held in September 2020 and subsequent interactions. The FDA accepted the dose to be tested, our proposal for a safety and futility\nassessment to be conducted on the first 10 patients, the endpoint to be assessed, the statistical analysis plan and study size of approximately 50 patients in\nthe mITT population (>60mCi TBD). Based upon this agreement, the pivotal study was initiated. The interim futility and safety assessment occurred in\n2022 and the iDMC determined the study exceeded the futility threshold and that the CST threshold was not met, therefore the study should continue to\nenroll with no change to the dosing regimen. The study achieved full enrollment in the fourth quarter 2023 and topline safety data was reported on 45\npatients meeting the criteria for the mITT population with a data cut-off date of January 3, 2024. Among mITT patients, median age was 71 years, median\nIgM level prior to treatment with iopofosine was 2,185, 90% were refractory to either a BTKi (18/36 50%) or anti-CD20 therapy (18/41 40%), with 26.7%\nmulticlass refractory, and 80% of patients were previously treated with a BTKi therapy. Topline efficacy evaluable population (n=41) was defined as\npatients who were in the mITT and had follow up of at least 60 days post last dose. The CLOVER WaM study met its primary endpoint with a major\nresponse rate (MRR) of 61% (95% confidence interval [44.50%, 75.80%, two-sided p value < 0.0001]) exceeding the agreed upon statistical hurdle of\n20%. The overall response rate (ORR) in evaluable patients was 75.6%, and 100% of patients experienced disease control. Responses were durable, with\nmedian duration of response not reached and 76% of patients remaining progression free at a median follow-up of eight months. These outcomes exceed\nreal world data, which demonstrate a 4-12% MRR and a duration of response of approximately six months or less despite continuous treatment in a patient\npopulation that is less pretreated and not refractory to multiple classes of drugs. Notably, iopofosine monotherapy achieved an 7.3% complete remission\n(CR) rate in this highly refractory WM population. Iopofosine I 131 was well tolerated and its toxicity profile was consistent with the Company's\npreviously reported safety data. There were no treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) leading to discontinuation. The rates of Grade 3 or greater\nTRAEs observed in more than 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia (55%), neutropenia (37%), and anemia (26%). All patients recovered from\ncytopenias with no reported aplastic sequalae. Importantly, there were no clinically significant bleeding events, and the rate of febrile neutropenia was 2%.\nThere were no treatment-related deaths in the study.\n7\nTable of Contents\nCLOVER-1: Phase 2 Study in Select B-Cell Malignancies\nThe Phase 2 CLOVER-1 study was an open-label study designed to determine the efficacy and safety of CLR 131 in select B-cell malignancies\n(multiple myeloma (MM), indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\n(LPL)/Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), DLBCL, and central nervous system\nlymphoma (CNSL) who have been previously treated with standard therapy for their underlying malignancy. As of March 2022, the study arms for\nCLL/SLL, LPL/WM, MZL, MCL, and DLBCL were closed. Dosing of patients varied by disease state cohort and was measured in terms of TBD.\nIn July 2016, we were awarded a $2,000,000 National Cancer Institute (NCI) Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research grant to further advance\nthe clinical development of iopofosine. The funds supported the Phase 2 study initiated in March 2017 to define the clinical benefits of iopofosine in r/r\nMM and other niche hematologic malignancies with unmet clinical need. These niche hematologic malignancies include CLL, SLL, MZL, LPL/WM and\nDLBCL. The study was conducted in approximately 10 U.S. cancer centers in patients with orphan-designated relapse or refractory hematologic cancers.\nThe planned study enrollment was up to 80 patients.\nThe study’s primary endpoint was clinical benefit response (CBR), with secondary endpoints of ORR, PFS, time to next treatment (TtNT), median\nOverall Survival (mOS), DOR and other markers of efficacy following patients receiving one of three TBDs of iopofosine (<50mCi, ~50mCi and\n>60mCi), with the option for a second cycle approximately 75-180 days later. Dosages were provided either as a single bolus or fractionated (the assigned\ndose level split into two doses) given day 1 and day 15. Over the course of the study the dosing regimen of iopofosine advanced from a single bolus dose to\ntwo cycles of fractionated administrations of 15 mCi/m2 per dose on days 1, 15 (cycle 1), and days 57, 71 (cycle 2). Adverse events occurring in at least\n25% of subjects were fatigue (39%) and cytopenias, specifically, thrombocytopenia (75%), anemia (61%), neutropenia (54%), leukopenia (51%), and\nlymphopenia (25%). Serious adverse events occurring in greater than 5% of subjects were restricted to thrombocytopenia (9%) and febrile neutropenia\n(7.5%).\nPhase 2a Study: Patients with r/r Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia Cohort\nPatients in the r/r WM cohort all received TBD of ≥ 60 mCi (25 mCi/m2 single bolus, 31.25 mCi/m2 fractionated, 37.5 mCi/m2 fractionated, or two\ncycles of mCi/m2 fractionated) either as a bolus dose or fractionated. Current data from our Phase 2a CLOVER-1 clinical study show a 100% ORR in six\nWM patients and an 83.3% major response rate with one patient achieving a complete response (CR), which reached 39 months post-last treatment. While\nmedian treatment free survival (TFS), also known as treatment free remission (TFR), and DOR have not been reached, the average treatment TFS/TFR is\ncurrently at 330 days. We believe this may represent an important improvement in the treatment of r/r WM as we believe no approved or late-stage\ndevelopment treatments for second- and third-line patients have reported a CR to date. Based on study results to date, patients continue to tolerate\niopofosine well, with the most common adverse events being cytopenias and fatigue.\nPhase 2a Study: Patients with r/r Multiple Myeloma Cohort\nIn September 2020, we announced that a 40% ORR was observed in the subset of refractory MM patients deemed triple class refractory who received\n60 mCi or greater TBD. Triple class refractory is defined as patients that are refractory to immunomodulatory, proteasome inhibitors and anti-CD38\nantibody drug classes. The 40% ORR (6/15 patients) represents triple class refractory patients enrolled in Part A of Cellectar’s CLOVER-1 study and\nadditional patients enrolled in Part B from March through May 2020 and received >60mCi TBD (25 mCi/m2 single bolus, 31.25 mCi/m2 fractionated, 37.5\nmCi/m2 fractionated, or two cycles of mCi/m2 fractionated) either as a bolus dose or fractionated. Patients with MM received 40 mg of dexamethasone\nconcurrently beginning within 24 hours of the first CLR 131 infusion. All MM patients enrolled in the expansion cohort are required to be triple class\nrefractory. The additional six patients enrolled in 2020 were heavily pre-treated with an average of nine prior multi-drug regimens. Three patients received\na TBD of > 60 mCi and three received less than 60 mCi. Consistent with the data released in February 2020, patients receiving > 60 mCi typically exhibit\ngreater responses. Based on study results to date, patients continue to tolerate iopofosine well, with the most common and almost exclusive treatment-\nemergent adverse events are cytopenias, such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2021, we presented data from 11 MM patients from our ongoing Phase 2 CLOVER-1 study in a poster at the American Society of\nHematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition. The MM patients were at least triple class refractory (defined as refractory to an immunomodulatory\nagent, proteasome inhibitor and monoclonal antibody) with data current as of May 2021. Patients had a median of greater than 7 prior therapies with 50%\nclassified as high risk. Initial results in these patients showed an ORR of 45.5%, a CBR of 72.7%, and a disease control rate (DCR) of 100%. Median PFS\nwas 3.4 months. In a subset of five quad/penta drug refractory patients, efficacy increased, demonstrating an ORR of 80% and CBR of 100% in this highly\ntreatment refractory group. The most commonly observed treatment emergent adverse events were cytopenias that included Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia\n(62.5%), anemia (62.5%), neutropenia (62.5%) and decreased white blood cell count (50%). Treatment emergent adverse events were mostly limited to\nbone marrow suppression in line with prior observations. No patients experienced treatment emergent adverse events of neuropathy, arrhythmia,\ncardiovascular event, bleeding, ocular toxicities, renal function, alterations in liver enzymes, or infusion-site reactions or adverse events. We continue to\nenrich the r/r MM patient cohort with patients that are even more refractory, specifically enrolling patients that are quad-class refractory (triple class plus\nrefractory to any of the recent approved product classes) and have relapsed post-BCMA immunotherapy. We reported in the Blood Cancer Journal in\nAugust 2022 that iopofosine demonstrated a 50% ORR in patients receiving >60mCi total administered dose (3/6 patients).\nPhase 2a: Patients with r/r non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma Cohort\nIn February 2020, we announced positive data from our Phase 2a CLOVER-1 study in patients with NHL patients were treated with three different\ndoses (<50mCi, ~50mCi and >60mCi TBD. Patients in the r/r NHL cohort received TBD of either ≥ 60 mCi or < 60 mCi (25 mCi/m2 single bolus, 31.25\nmCi/m2 fractionated, 37.5 mCi/m2 fractionated, or two cycles of mCi/m2 fractionated) either as a bolus dose or fractionated. Patients with r/r NHL who\nreceived <60mCi TBD and the >60mCi TBD had a 42% and 43% ORR, respectively and a combined rate of 42%. These patients were also heavily pre-\ntreated, having a median of three prior lines of treatment (range, 1 to 9) with the majority of patients being refractory to rituximab and/or ibrutinib. The\npatients had a median age of 70 with a range of 51 to 86. All patients had bone marrow involvement with an average of 23%. In addition to these findings,\nsubtype assessments were completed in the r/r B-cell NHL patients. Patients with DLBCL demonstrated a 30% ORR with one patient achieving a CR,\nwhich continues at nearly 24 months post-treatment. The ORR for CLL/SLL and MZL patients was 33%.\nBased upon the dose response observed in the Phase 2a study for patients receiving TBDs of 60mCi or greater, we determined that patient dosing of\niopofosine in the pivotal study would be >60mCi TBD. Therefore, patients are now grouped as receiving <60mCi or >60mCi TBD.\nThe most frequently reported adverse events in all patients were cytopenias, which followed a predictable course and timeline. The frequency of\nadverse events did not increase as doses were increased and the profile of cytopenias remained consistent. Importantly, our assessment is that these\ncytopenias have had a predictable pattern to initiation, nadir and recovery and are treatable. The most common grade ≥3 events at the highest dose (75mCi\nTBD) were hematologic toxicities including thrombocytopenia (65%), neutropenia (41%), leukopenia (30%), anemia (24%) and lymphopenia (35%). No\npatients experienced cardiotoxicities, neurological toxicities, infusion site reactions, peripheral neuropathy, allergic reactions, cytokine release syndrome,\nkeratopathy, renal toxicities, or changes in liver enzymes. The safety and tolerability profile in patients with r/r NHL was similar to r/r MM patients except\nfor fewer cytopenias of any grade. Based upon iopofosine being well tolerated across all dose groups, the observed response rate, and especially in difficult\nto treat patients such as high risk and triple class refractory or penta-refractory, and corroborating data showing the potential to further improve upon\ncurrent ORRs and durability of those responses, the study has been expanded to test a two-cycle dosing optimization regimen with a target TBD >60\nmCi/m2 of iopofosine.\nIn May 2020, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for iopofosine in WM in patients having received two or more prior\ntreatment regimens.\nPhase 1 Study in Patients with r/r Multiple Myeloma\nIn February 2020, final results from a multicenter, Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of iopofosine in r/r MM were presented. The trial was designed\nto evaluate the safety and potential initial efficacy of iopofosine administered in an up to 30-minute I.V. infusion either as a single bolus dose or as a\nfractionated dose in heavily pretreated MM patients. The study enrolled a total of 26 evaluable patients at three trial sites. For the trial, which used a\nmodified three-plus-three dose escalation design, 15 evaluable patients were dosed in single bolus doses from 12.5mCi/m2 up to 31.25mCi/m2 (TBD\n20.35-59.17 mCi) and 11 evaluable patients were dosed in fractionated dosing cohorts of 31.25mCi/m2 to 40mCi/m2 (TBD 54.915-89.107 mCi). An iDMC\ndid not identify dose-limiting toxicities in any cohort. Of the 26 evaluable patients in the trial, a partial response was observed in 4 of 26 patients (15.4%)\nand stable\n9\nTable of Contents\ndisease or minimal response in 22 of 26 patients (84.6%), for a disease control rate of 100%. A significant decrease in M-protein and free light chain (FLC)\nwas also observed.\nIopofosine in combination with dexamethasone was under investigation in adult patients with r/r MM. MM is an incurable cancer of the plasma cells\nand is the second most common form of hematologic cancer. Patients had to be refractory to or relapsed from at least one proteasome inhibitor and at least\none immunomodulatory agent. The clinical study was a standard three-plus-three dose escalation safety study to determine the maximum tolerable dose.\nWe use the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) definitions of response, which involve monitoring the surrogate markers of efficacy, M protein\nand FLC. The IMWG defines a PR as a 50% or greater decrease in M protein or to 50% or greater decrease in FLC levels (for patients in whom M protein\nis unmeasurable). Secondary objectives included the evaluation of therapeutic activity by assessing surrogate efficacy markers, which include M protein,\nFLC, PFS and OS. All patients were heavily pretreated with an average of five prior lines of therapy. An iDMC assessed the safety of iopofosine up to its\nplanned maximum single, bolus dose of 31.25 mCi/m2 or a TBD of ~63 mCi. The four single dose cohorts examined were: 12.5 mCi/m2 (~25mCi TBD),\n18.75 mCi/m2 (~37.5mCi TBD), 25 mCi/m2(~50mCi TBD), and 31.25 mCi/m2(~62.5mCi TBD), all in combination with low dose dexamethasone (40 mg\nweekly). Of the five patients in the first cohort, four were assessed as achieving stable disease and one patient progressed at Day 15 after administration\nand was taken off the study. Of the five patients admitted to the second cohort, all five were assessed as achieving stable disease; however, one patient\nprogressed at Day 41 after administration and was taken off the study. Four patients were enrolled to the third cohort, and all were assessed as achieving\nstable disease. In September 2017, we announced safety and tolerability data for cohort 4, in which patients were treated with a single infusion up to 30-\nminutes of 31.25mCi/m2 of iopofosine, which was tolerated by the three patients in the cohort. Additionally, all three patients experienced CBR with one\npatient achieving a partial response (PR). The patient experiencing a PR had an 82% reduction in FLC. This patient did not produce M protein, had\nreceived seven prior lines of treatment including radiation, stem cell transplantation and multiple triple combination treatments including one with\ndaratumumab that was not tolerated. One patient experiencing stable disease attained a 44% reduction in M protein. In January 2019, we announced that\nthe pooled mOS data from the first four cohorts was 22.0 months. In late 2018, we modified this study to evaluate a fractionated dosing strategy to\npotentially increase efficacy and decrease adverse events.\nCohorts five and six received fractionated dosing of 31.25 mCi/m2(~62.5mCi TBD) and 37.5 mCi/m2 (~75mCi TBD), each administered on day 1 and\nday 8. Following the determination that all prior dosing cohorts were tolerated, we initiated a cohort seven utilizing a 40mCi/m2 (~95mCi TBD)\nfractionated dose administered 20mCi/m2 (~40mCi TBD) on days 1 and day 8. Cohort seven was the highest pre-planned dose cohort and subjects have\ncompleted the evaluation period. The study completed enrollment and the final clinical study report is expected in the first half of 2022. Adverse events\noccurring in at least 25% of subjects were fatigue (26%) and cytopenias, specifically, thrombocytopenia (90%), anemia (65%), neutropenia (55%),\nleukopenia (61%), and lymphopenia (58%). Serious adverse events occurring in greater than two subjects were restricted to febrile neutropenia n=3\n(9.7%).\nIn May 2019, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track Designation for iopofosine in fourth line or later r/r MM. Iopofosine is currently being\nevaluated in our ongoing CLOVER-1 Phase 2 clinical study in patients with r/r MM and other select B-cell lymphomas. Patients in the study received up to\nfour, approximately 20-minute, IV infusions of iopofosine over 3 months, with doses given 14 days apart in each cycle and a maximum of two cycles. Low\ndose dexamethasone 40 mg weekly (20mg in patients ≥ 75), was provided for up to 12 weeks. The planned study enrollment was up to 80 patients. Its\nprimary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR), with additional endpoints of ORR, PFS, median overall survival (OS) and other markers of efficacy.\nOver the course of the study the dosing regimen of iopofosine advanced from a single bolus dose to two cycles of fractionated administrations of 15\nmCi/m2 per dose on days 1, 15 (cycle 1), and days 57, 71 (cycle 2). Following treatment with iopofosine, approximately 91% of patients experience a\nreduction in tumor marker with approximately 73% experiencing greater than 37% reduction.\nCLOVER 2: Phase 1 Study in r/r Pediatric Patients with select Solid tumors, Lymphomas and Malignant Brain Tumors\nIn December 2017, the Division of Oncology at the FDA accepted our IND and study design for the Phase 1 study of iopofosine in children and\nadolescents with select rare and orphan designated cancers. This study was initiated during the first quarter of 2019. In December 2017, we submitted an\nIND application for r/r pediatric patients with select solid tumors, lymphomas and malignant brain tumors. The Phase 1 clinical study of iopofosine is an\nopen-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of intravenous administration of iopofosine in children and\nadolescents with relapsed or refractory malignant solid tumors (neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma) and lymphoma or\nrecurrent or refractory malignant brain tumors for which there are no standard treatments. Secondary objectives of the study are to identify the\nrecommended efficacious dose of iopofosine and to determine preliminary antitumor activity (treatment response) of iopofosine in children and\nadolescents.\n10\nTable of Contents\nIn August 2020, based on data on four dose levels from 15mCi/m2 up to 60mCi/m2, the iDMC permitted the beginning of the evaluation of the next\nhigher dose cohort, at 75mCi/m2. The iDMC advised, based upon the initial data, to enrich the 60 mCi/m2 dose level for patients over the age of 10 with\nHGG and Ewing sarcoma. Changes in various tumor parameters appeared to demonstrate initial response and tumor uptake. This includes patients with\nrelapsed HGGs with over five months of PFS. In November 2020, we announced clinical data providing that iopofosine had been measured in pediatric\nbrain tumors, confirming that systemic administration of iopofosine crosses the blood brain barrier and is delivered into tumors and that the data show\ndisease control in heavily pretreated patients with ependymomas. In November 2021, we announced favorable data on changes in various tumor\nparameters in a Phase 1 study in children and adolescents with relapsed and refractory high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and soft tissue sarcomas. Pediatric\nHGGs are a collection of aggressive brain and central nervous system tumor subtypes (i.e. diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, glioblastomas, astrocytomas,\nependymomas, etc.) with about 400 new pediatric cases diagnosed annually in the U.S. Children with these tumors have a poor prognosis and limited 5-\nyear survival. Adverse events occurring in at least 25% of subjects were fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting (28% respectively), and cytopenias,\nspecifically, thrombocytopenia (67%), anemia (67%), neutropenia (61%), leukopenia (56%), and lymphopenia (33%). There were no serious adverse\nevents occurring in more than 2 subjects. The Part A portion of this Phase 1 study has concluded, and part B has initiated to determine the appropriate\ndosing regimen in pediatric patients with r/r HGG. In 2022, the NCI awarded Cellectar a $1,900,000 SBIR Phase 2 grant to explore iopofosine in pediatric\nHGG.\nIn 2018, the FDA granted ODD and RPDD for iopofosine for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and\nosteosarcoma. If iopofosine should be approved for any of these pediatric indications, the first approved RPDD would enable us to receive a priority\nreview voucher. Priority review vouchers can be used by the sponsor to receive priority review for a future New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologic\nLicense Application (BLA) submission, which would reduce the FDA review time from 12 months to six months. Currently, these vouchers can also be\ntransferred or sold to another entity. In December 2020, the FDA extended the Priority Review Voucher Program through September 2026 for rare pediatric\ndiseases.\nPhase 1 Study in r/r Head and Neck Cancer\nIn August 2016, the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) was awarded a five-year Specialized Programs of Research\nExcellence (SPORE) grant of $12,000,000 from the NCI and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research to improve treatments and\noutcomes for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. HNC is the sixth most common cancer across the world with approximately 56,000 new patients\ndiagnosed every year in the U.S. As a key component of this grant, the UWCCC researchers completed testing of iopofosine in various animal HNC\nmodels and initiated the first human clinical study enrolling up to 30 patients combining iopofosine and external beam radiation treatment (EBRT) with\nrecurrent HNC in the fourth quarter of 2019. UWCCC has completed the part A portion of a safety and tolerability study of iopofosine in combination with\nEBRT and preliminary data suggest safety and tolerability in relapsed or refractory HNC. The reduction in the amount or fractions (doses) of EBRT has the\npotential to diminish the (number and severity of) adverse events associated with EBRT. Patients with HNC typically receive approximately 60-70 Grays\n(Gy) of EBRT given as 2 – 3 Gy daily doses over a six-week timeframe. Patients can experience long-term tumor control following re-irradiation in this\nsetting; however, this approach can cause severe injury to normal tissue structures, significant adverse events and diminished quality of life. Part B of the\nstudy was to assess the safety and potential benefits of iopofosine in combination with EBRT in a cohort of up to 24 patients. This portion of the study has\nfully enrolled, and data were reported at the ASTRO 2024 conference on March 2, 2024. Complete remission was achieved in 64% of patients, with an\nORR of 73% (n=11). Prior to treatment with iopofosine I 131, six patients had multiple recurrence and one had metastatic disease, both of which are\nindicative of poor outcomes. Additionally, the study demonstrated durability of tumor control with an overall survival of 67% and progression free survival\nof 42% at 12 months. Eleven patients (92%) experienced a treatment-related adverse event. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurring\nin 20% or more patients were thrombocytopenia (75%), lymphopenia (75%), leukopenia (75%), neutropenia (67%), and anemia (42%). Observed adverse\nevents were consistent with the known toxicity profile of iopofosine I 131, with cytopenias being the most common. All patients recovered. We believe that\nthese data support the notion of enhanced patient outcomes when combining the use of iopofosine I 131 in combination with external beam radiation for a\ntreatment of solid tumors.\n11\nTable of Contents\nPreclinical Pipeline\nWe believe our PDC platform has potential to provide targeted delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads, as exemplified by the product\ncandidates listed below, that may result in improvements upon current standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of a broad range of human cancers:\n● CLR 12120 Series is an alpha emitting radio-conjugate program. The company has validated the in vivo potential of alpha emitting phospholipid\nradioconjugates and their potential to treat highly refractory and difficult to treat solid tumors. Cellectar is currently progressing with a lead\nmolecule using actinium-225 as the alpha emitting payload.\n● The company has developed a series of proprietary small molecule phospholipid drug conjugates. These programs employ either novel payload or\nnovel linkers. Many of these molecules have demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in preclinical mouse models. The collaboration with IntoCell\nInc., successfully met its agreed upon endpoint. The collaboration provided significant data which has led Cellectar to select a series of highly\npotent cytotoxic small molecule payloads for further development.\n● In collaboration with other parties, Cellectar has also validated that the PLE is capable of delivering peptide payloads and oligonucleotide\n(siRNA, mRNA, etc.) payloads to the tumors when delivered systemically. These molecules have also been shown to demonstrate activity and\nsafety in multiple preclinical mouse models. Based upon these collaborations and the data, the company has initiated internal proprietary\nprograms with each of these treatment modalities.\nTechnology Overview\nOur product candidates are based on a cancer-targeting delivery platform of optimized phospholipid ether (PLE) analogs (phospholipid ether\nproprietary delivery vehicle) that interact with lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are specialized regions of a cell’s membrane phospholipid bilayer that contain high\nconcentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids and serve to organize cell surface and intracellular signaling molecules. As a result of enrichment and\nstabilization of lipid rafts in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, our product candidates provide selective targeting preferentially to cancer cells over\nnormal healthy cells. The cancer-targeting PLE delivery vehicle was deliberately designed to be combined with therapeutic, diagnostic and imaging\nmolecules. For example, the cytotoxic radioisotope, iodine-131, can be attached via a stable covalent bond to the PLE resulting in our lead PDC,\niopofosine. Non-radioactive molecules, including many classes of small molecule chemotherapeutic compounds, oligos, peptides and other molecules can\nalso be attached to the delivery vehicle.\nIn parallel to advancing the clinical development of our lead PDC, iopofosine, in both adult and pediatric orphan indications, we remain focused on\nexploring the creation of additional PDCs ranging from newly discovered to well-characterized anti-cancer agent payloads. The objective is to develop\nPDC chemotherapeutics through conjugation of our delivery vehicle and non-targeted anti-cancer agents to improve therapeutic indices and expand\npotential indications through the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic payloads Other than CLR 12120, all are from non-radiotherapeutic treatment\nmodalities, i.e. small-molecule, peptide, or oligonucleotide cancer-targeting chemotherapeutics in pre-clinical research. To date, multiple cancer-targeting\nproduct profiles have been generated from a single chemical core structure that is the foundation of our technology platform. We also believe that\nadditional cytotoxic PDCs may be developed possessing enhanced therapeutic indices versus the original, non-targeted cytotoxic payload as a\nmonotherapy.\nMalignant tumor targeting, including targeting of cancer stem cells, has been demonstrated in vivo in animal models as well as in clinical studies. Mice\nwithout intact immune systems and inoculated with Panc-1 (pancreatic carcinoma) cells, were injected with CLR 1502, 24 or 96 hours prior to imaging. In\nvivo optical imaging showed pronounced accumulation of CLR 1502 in tumors versus non-target organs and tissues. Similarly, positron emission\ntomography (PET) imaging of tumor-bearing animals (colon, glioma, triple negative breast, and pancreatic tumor xenograft models) administered the\nimaging agent CLR 124 clearly shows selective uptake and retention by both primary tumors and metastases, including cancer stem cells. PET/CT analysis\nfollowing co-injection of iopofosine (for therapy) and CLR 124 (for imaging) revealed time-dependent tumor responses and disappearance over nine days\nin a cancer xenograft model. We believe that the capability of our technology to target and be selectively retained by cancer stem cells in vivo was\ndemonstrated by treating glioma stem cell-derived orthotopic tumor-bearing mice with another fluorescent-labeled PDC (CLR 1501), and then removing\nthe tumor and isolating cancer stem cells, which continued to display CLR 1501 labeling even after three weeks in cell culture.\n12\nTable of Contents\nThe basis for selective tumor targeting of our compounds lies in differences between the plasma membranes of cancer cells as compared to those of\nmost normal cells. Data suggests that lipid rafts serve as portals of entry for PDCs such as iopofosine and our multiple series of drug conjugates. The\nmarked selectivity of our compounds for cancer cells versus non-cancer cells likely results from cancer cells maintenance of an overabundance of lipid\nrafts and the stabilization of these microdomains within the plasma membrane as compared to normal cells. Following cell entry via lipid rafts, iopofosine\nis transported into the cytoplasm, where it traffics along the Golgi apparatus and is distributed to various peri-nuclear organelles (including mitochondria\nand the endoplasmic reticulum). The pivotal role played by lipid rafts is underscored by the fact that disruption of lipid raft architecture significantly\neliminates uptake of our PDC delivery vehicle into cancer cells.\nProducts in Development\nIopofosine\nIopofosine is a small molecule, radioconjugate, composed of our proprietary PLE, 18-(p-[I-131]iodophenyl) octadacyl phosphocholine, acting as a\ncancer-targeting delivery and retention vehicle, covalently labeled with iodine-131, a cytotoxic (cell-killing) radioisotope with a half-life of eight days that\nis already in common use to treat thyroid, pediatric tumors and other cancer types including NHL. Iopofosine binds to the cell surface of cancer cells and is\ndelivered into the cytoplasm of the cancer cell. It is this “intracellular radiation” mechanism of cancer cell killing, coupled with delivery to a wide range of\nmalignant tumor types that we believe provides iopofosine with anti-cancer activity and a unique product profile. Selective uptake and retention have been\ndemonstrated in cancer stem cells compared with normal cells, offering the prospect of longer lasting anti-cancer activity.\nTumor treatment with radioactive isotopes has been used as a fundamental cancer therapeutic for decades. The goals of targeted cancer therapy —\nselective delivery of effective doses of isotopes that destroy tumor tissue, sparing of surrounding normal tissue, and non-accumulation in vital organs such\nas the liver and kidneys — remain goals of new therapies as well. We believe our targeted delivery technology has the potential to achieve these goals.\nIopofosine has been shown in animal models and various clinical studies to reliably, and near-universally, accumulate in cancer cells including cancer stem\ncells. This strategy has allowed us to take a multi-indication approach in the development and potential commercialization of iopofosine. To date, the\nCompany has focused on rare cancers with significant unmet need including WM, MM, sarcomas, and HGG, among others.\nMarket Overview\nOur target market is broad and represents the market for the treatment of cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates 1 in 3 people will develop\ncancer in their lifetime. Approximately 1.92 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2022 and approximately 609,360 cancer deaths in\nthe U.S. The global market for cancer drugs reached $148 billion in annual sales (2020), and with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% could\nreach $288 billion by 2030, according to a report dated August 2022 by Straits Research. This growth will be driven by emerging targeted therapies, which\nare expected to change the cancer treatment landscape (Cowen Report 2020), and an increased use of cancer drug combination regimens.\nWaldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia\nWM is a rare and incurable disease defined by specific genotypic subtypes that defines patient responses and long-term outcomes. The U.S. annual\nincidence is 1,500 – 1,900 with prevalence of approximately 26,000 and 110,000 patients globally. WM is a lymphoma, or cancer of the lymphatic system.\nThe disease occurs in a type of white blood cell called a B-lymphocyte or B-cell, which normally matures into a plasma cell that plays an important part in\nthe body’s immune system by manufacturing immunoglobulins (antibodies) to help the body fight infection. In WM, there is a malignant change to the B-\ncell in the late stages of maturing, and it continues to proliferate into a clone of identical cells, primarily in the bone marrow but also in the lymph nodes\nand other tissues and organs of the lymphatic system. These clonal cells over-produce an antibody of a specific class called IgM.\nWM cells have characteristics of both cancerous B-lymphocytes (NHL) and plasma cells (MM), and they are called lymphoplasmacytic cells. For that\nreason, WM is classified as a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma called LPL. About 95% of LPL cases are WM; the remaining 5% do not secrete IgM and\nconsequently are not classified as WM.\nSeveral drugs have demonstrated activity either alone or in combinations but only a single class of BTKi’s, in the form of two drugs (ibrutinib and\nzanubrutinib), have received regulatory approval. Treatment is mainly focused on the control of symptoms and the prevention of organ damage. Front-line\ntreatments for WM include rituximab alone or in combination with other agents, including ibrutinib. In the salvage therapy (second line or later) setting,\nBTKi’s, and other combinations are considered (bendamustine,\n13\nTable of Contents\nproteosome inhibitors, etc.). Ibrutinib and zanubrutinib are the only drugs to receive regulatory approval (in 2015 and 2020, respectively) as a salvage\ntherapy; in late 2019, ibrutinib was approved for front-line treatment in combination with rituximab. Factors such as long-term cytopenias, age, hyper-\nviscosity, the need for quick disease control, lymphadenopathy, co-morbidities, and IgM-related end-organ damage are key considerations in the choice of\ntreatment.\nMultiple Myeloma\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute SEER database, multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer with a U.S. incidence\nrate of 32,270 and a relapse or refractory patient population of 43,727. In 2022, Datamonitor Healthcare estimated the MM dollar market size to be over\n$23B in 2023 and is forecasted to increase to nearly $47B in 2031. The increase in drug sales over this period will be mainly driven by the increasing\nincidence of MM with the U.S. market remaining the largest potential market. It is believed the largest growth will occur in patients receiving at least three\nlines of treatment because of the expanding elderly population, increases in treatment population and increasing rates of survival from earlier lines of\ntreatment. According to data obtained from Decision Resource Group, over 40% of patients in later lines of therapy, while eligible, refuse treatment\nbecause of higher treatment failure, severity of adverse events and difficulty of treatment dosing regimen. The average response rates for patients receiving\ntheir fourth and fifth-line treatment are 15% and 8% response rates, respectively. Additionally, the mOS for these patients also decreases by line of therapy\nand is less than 9 months post third-line treatment.\nBased on the iopofosine Phase 1 and Phase 2 product profile demonstrated in fifth-line patients to date, we believe iopofosine may address the unmet\nmedical need in the heavily pre-treated patient population described above.\nB-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma\nB-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (BCNHL) represents cancers of the lymphatic system. BCNHL may be indolent or aggressive and circulate in the\nblood or form tumors in lymph nodes. According to the American Cancer Society, the estimated 2023 US incidence of BCNHL was 68,468 cases. Nine\ntypes of B-cell lymphomas include CLL, SLL, MCL, MZL, and the most common lymphoma, DLBCL. According to a report dated June 2019 by Global\nData Research Group, the BCNHL market was valued at $7.2 billion for 2022, with a forecasted increase to $11.7 billion in 2032 at a CAGR of 4.9%.\nWe believe there is a significant unmet medical need in B-cell lymphoma as a result of continued high mortality and poor response rates remain in\nsecond and third- line treatments compounded by the limited durability of responses.\nBased on the iopofosine Phase 2 product profile demonstrated in DLBCL patients to date treated with a single dose, we believe iopofosine may\naddress the unmet medical need in the patient population described above as well.\nNeuroblastoma\nNeuroblastoma, a neoplasm of the sympathetic nervous system, is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, accounting for\napproximately 7-10% of childhood cancers and 50% of infant cancers, in the U.S. The NCI states the incidence is about 10.54 cases per 1 million per year\nin children younger than 15 years and 90% are younger than 5 years at diagnosis. Over 800 new cases are diagnosed each year in North America.\nApproximately 50% of patients present with metastatic disease requiring systemic treatment. Clinical consequences include abdominal distension,\nproptosis, bone pain, pancytopenia, fever and paralysis.\nAlthough treatment rates have improved within the clinical paradigm, half of children with neuroblastoma still relapse or fail to respond to upfront\ntherapy. Survival for those with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma currently reports as a four-year overall survival rate of 20%.\n14\nTable of Contents\nHigh Grade Glioma\nHigh Grade Glioma (HGG) is a fast-growing tumor of glial cells in the brain or spinal cord. The WHO classifies these as Grade 3 or 4 based on the\ngrowth rate, and these tumors are often incurable. Approximately 10-20% of pediatric tumors are HGG, amounting to a global incidence of approximately\n33,000 cases. Available treatment options are limited to surgery, radiation therapy, and aggressive chemotherapeutic combinations. Prognosis continues to\nimprove with development of targeted therapies, but the five-year overall survival rate is still less than 20%.\nSarcomas\nSarcomas represent a heterogeneous disease group. Sarcomas grow in connective tissue, or cells that connect or support other kinds of tissue in the\nbody. These tumors are most common in the bones, muscles, tendons, cartilage, nerves, and blood vessels. Sarcomas represent 15% of all pediatric tumors\nand 21% of pediatric solid tumors. The National Cancer Institute SEER database estimates that there were 2,060 incidences in 2019. The median age at\ndiagnosis was 3, the median age of death was 5.\nWe are focused on 3 subsets of sarcomas:\n● Osteosarcoma: the tumor develops in growing bone tissues, accounts for 28% of all bone sarcomas and is the most common pediatric sarcoma\n(56%).\n● Ewing’s sarcoma: the tumor develops in immature tissues in bone marrow.\n● Rhabdomyosarcoma: the tumors develop in the muscles – predominately skeletal muscle.\nBased on information from Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast, the global market value of the pediatric sarcoma market is expected\nto nearly double from $490 million in 2022 to $1.01 billion in 2029. This growth is expected to be driven by the high rate of recurrence in pediatrics,\nincreased incidence in select markets and new high-priced therapies coming to the market.\nManufacturing\nIopofosine drug product is made via a five-step synthetic process. The release specifications for the drug product have been established and validated.\nThrough process improvements, we have been able to achieve longer expiry dating for the compound extending finished product shelf-life to further\nfacilitate ex-U.S. distribution from North America.\nWe have successfully executed large scale production of the drug substance via a contract manufacturing organization that has been inspected and\napproved by the FDA and the EMA. We have also demonstrated 60-month stability for the drug substance in desiccated and refrigerated forms at small\nscale and are replicating this at large scale.\nAtomVie (formerly known as The Centre for Probe Development and Commercialization (CPDC)), a validated Current Good Manufacturing Practices\n(cGMPs) manufacturing organization specializing in radiopharmaceuticals, is our primary source to supply drug product for our ongoing research and\nclinical studies, including our Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of iopofosine. We believe that AtomVie and our other third-party manufacturers have the ability\nto supply large scale clinical and commercial scale material.\nSales and Marketing\nThe US WM market represents approximately $2.1 billion and is a very concentrated market, with 10 states harboring 60% of the WM cases. Based\nupon the concentrated nature of the US WM market, we plan to pursue building a scalable and efficient commercial team to commercialize iopofosine. We\nare currently exploring options for the WM opportunity outside of the US market, which will seek to establish an arrangement with one or more\nbiotechnology or pharmaceutical companies with strong product development and commercialization expertise and distribution infrastructure in Europe\nand parts of global markets.\nPotential Commercial Competition to Our Current and Future Clinical-Stage Compounds\nCurrently, many classes of approved products with various mechanisms of action exist, including immune-modulating agents, proteasome inhibitors,\nhistone deacetylase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids, and traditional chemotherapeutics for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. There\nalso remain a significant number of compounds being researched and developed for the\n15\nTable of Contents\ntreatment of cancer. We are focused on the product development and commercialization of adult and pediatric orphan designated indications with unmet\nclinical need. While multiple adult hematology indications for iopofosine were evaluated, WM was selected based on iopofosine’s efficacy and safety\nprofile demonstrated to date. Other considerations such as the regulatory pathway, unmet clinical need, limited commercial competition and cost\nefficiencies were also assessed. We believe iopofosine is a therapeutic option in either adult or pediatric relapse or refractory settings either as a\nmonotherapy or in combination with currently approved agents, some of which are radio-sensitizing and maintain a differential adverse event profile from\nthat of iopofosine.\nIntellectual Property\nOur core technology platform is based on research conducted at the University of Michigan in 1994, where phospholipid ether analogs were initially\ndesigned, synthesized, radiolabeled, and evaluated. This research was transferred to the University of Wisconsin-Madison between 1998 and the\nsubsequent founding of Cellectar in 2000 to further develop and commercialize the technology. We obtained exclusive rights to the related technology\npatents owned by University of Michigan in 2003 and continued development of the PDC platform while obtaining ownership of numerous additional\npatents and patent applications (with various expiry until 2034 without extensions). We have established a broad U.S. and international intellectual\nproperty rights portfolio around our proprietary cancer-targeting PLE technology platform including iopofosine and our PDC Programs.\nPDC Chemotherapeutic Programs\nIn November 2015, we converted our previously filed provisional patent application for Phospholipid-Ether Analogs as Cancer Targeting Drug\nVehicles to non-provisional US and International (PCT) patent applications and were published by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office (USPTO) in May of\n2016. These patent applications further protect composition of matter and method of use for PDCs developed with our proprietary phospholipid-ether\ndelivery vehicle conjugated with any existing or future cytotoxic agents, including chemotherapeutics for targeted delivery to cancer cells and cancer stem\ncells. Additional cytotoxic PDC compounds are covered by pending patent applications directed to the composition of matter and method of use for cancer\ntherapy provide intellectual property protection is possible in the U.S. and up to 157 additional countries. These applications, if granted, offer protection\nextending through at least 2035 in the U.S. and key international markets.\nIopofosine\nWe have taken a broad approach to creating market exclusivity for iopofosine both within the U.S., and globally, including all major markets. This\napproach includes numerous patents, patent applications and regulatory filings to provide maximum market exclusivity. Our patent portfolio for iopofosine\nincludes all the typical filings as well as unique methods of use, methods of synthesis, use in combinations, use to treat cancer stem cells, novel\nformulations, etc. In addition to our patents, we were granted ODD for iopofosine by the FDA for the treatment of MM in December 2014 and for WM in\nJanuary 2020. Furthermore, we received ODD from the European Union for MM in September 2019, and for WM in January 2021. We expect to file\nadditional orphan designations for other rare diseases. We continue to evaluate iopofosine in additional hematologic and solid tumor orphan designated\nindications. Our patents have a variety of expected expiration dates with some potentially being extended on a country-by-country basis. In 2018, the FDA\na granted orphan drug and a RPDD for iopofosine for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and osteosarcoma. We\ninitiated a Phase 1 study in 2019.\nWe expect to continue to file patent applications and acquire licenses to other patents covering methods of use, composition of matter, formulation,\nmethod of synthesis and other patentable claims related to iopofosine and new PDCs. These patent applications will be filed in key commercial markets\nworldwide.\nIn addition to the above noted patents/applications directed to iopofosine and our PDC pipeline portfolio, we own other patents/applications directed to\ndifferent forms of phospholipid ethers, methods of use and methods of manufacturing of phospholipid ethers.\nSeparate from any patent protection and following product approval by regulatory authorities, data exclusivity may be available for various\ncompounds for up to 10 years on a country-by-country basis (e.g., up to five years in the U.S. and up to ten years in Europe).\n16\nTable of Contents\nLicenses / Collaborations\nIn August 2018, we entered into a collaboration with Orano Med for the development of novel PDCs utilizing Orano Med’s alpha emitter lead-212\nconjugated to our phospholipid ether; the companies evaluated the new PDCs in up to three oncology indications. The collaboration successfully met its\nendpoints. The in vivo animal data demonstrated that the PDC combined with an alpha emitting radioisotope resulted in significant reduction in tumor\nvolumes in all animal models tested. However, because of the limited half-life and associated logistical challenges associated with lead-212, Cellectar\nelected to advance an alternative alpha-emitting radioisotope.\nIn July 2021, we entered into a co-development and commercialization collaboration with LegoChemBio, a clinical stage biotechnology company to\nutilize their proprietary drug conjugate linker-toxin platform to further enhance our portfolio of next generation PDC therapeutics.\nResearch and Development\nOur primary activity to date has been research and development. The research had historically been conducted at our facility in Madison, Wisconsin\nand through third-party laboratories and academic universities. Starting in 2018, we no longer used the facility in Madison, Wisconsin for these activities.\nClinical development has been completed primarily through contract research organizations at hospitals and academic centers. We have established a\ncollaboration outsourcing model to leverage third-party expertise, accelerate project timelines, improve productivity and limit spend and fixed costs. Our\nresearch and development expenses were approximately $28,211,000 and $ 19,160,000 for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nRegulation\nThe production, distribution, and marketing of products employing our technology, and our development activities, are subject to extensive\ngovernmental regulation in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the\nregulations of the FDA, as well as to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including the federal, state and local laws and regulations\ngoverning the storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including radioactive isotopes. These laws, and similar laws outside the U.S., govern the\nclinical and pre-clinical testing, research and development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, distribution, sale, import,\nexport, storage, record-keeping, reporting, advertising and promotion, sampling, and tracking and tracing of drugs. Product development and approval\nwithin this regulatory framework, if successful, will take many years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. Violations of regulatory\nrequirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the delay in approving or refusal to approve a product by the FDA or other\nhealth authorities. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions, which include civil money penalties, injunctions, seizure\nof regulated product, and civil and criminal charges. The following paragraphs provide further information on certain legal and regulatory issues with a\nparticular potential to affect our operations or future marketing of products employing our technology.\nU.S. Research, Development, and Product Approval Process\nIn the US, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations. The failure\nto comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after\napproval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending\napplications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product\nseizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits,\nor civil or criminal investigations and penalties.\nThe research, development, and approval process in the U.S. and elsewhere is intensive and rigorous and generally takes many years to complete. The\ntypical process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug may be marketed in the U.S. includes:\n● pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, and formulation studies, performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations;\n● submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may commence;\n● approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;\n17\nTable of Contents\n● performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies performed under the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices (GCP) regulations, to\nevaluate the drug’s safety and effectiveness for its intended uses;\n● submission of a marketing application to the FDA for one or more proposed indications;\n● review by an FDA advisory committee, if requested by the FDA;\n● Satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities in which the drug is manufactured, processed,\npacked, or held complies with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), requirements and standards designed to that the facilities, methods\nand controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;\n● satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data;\n● payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and\n● compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or\nREMS, and potentially post-market requirement, or PMR, and commitment, or PMC, studies.\nPre-Clinical Testing\nDuring pre-clinical testing, studies are performed with respect to the chemical and physical properties of candidate formulations. Preclinical studies\ninclude laboratory evaluation as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, and activity of the drug for initial\ntesting in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. These studies are subject to applicable GLP requirements. Biological testing is typically\ndone in animal models to demonstrate the activity of the compound against the targeted disease or condition and to assess the apparent effects of the new\nproduct candidate on various organ systems, as well as its relative therapeutic effectiveness and safety. The results of the preclinical tests, together with\nmanufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the\nFDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, including but not limited to animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity,\nand long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.\nSubmission of IND\nAn IND must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before studies in humans may commence. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that\nallows an unapproved new drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to\nadminister an investigational drug to humans. In support of the IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol\namendments. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or\nliterature, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND\nbefore clinical trials may begin. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the\ntrials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding\nconcerns before clinical trials can begin or resume. An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan\nfor any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB\ncan suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial.\nClinical Studies\nClinical study programs in humans generally follow a three-phase process. Typically, Phase 1 studies are conducted in small numbers of healthy\nvolunteers or, on occasion, in patients afflicted with the target disease. Phase 1 studies are conducted to determine the metabolic and pharmacological\naction of the product candidate in humans and the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.\nDuring Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug's safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit\nthe design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. In Phase 2, controlled clinical studies are generally conducted in larger groups of patients\nhaving the target disease or condition in order to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug, and to obtain\npreliminary data\n18\nTable of Contents\non the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate and optimal dosing. This phase also helps determine further the safety profile of the product\ncandidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical studies are generally conducted in patients having the target disease or condition to provide sufficient data of\neffectiveness and safety of the product candidate that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis\nfor physician labeling, as required by U.S. regulatory agencies.\nIn the case of products for certain serious or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing may be done in patients with the disease rather than in\nhealthy volunteers. Because these patients are already afflicted with the target disease or condition, it is possible that such studies will also provide results\ntraditionally obtained in Phase 2 studies. These studies are often referred to as “Phase 1/2” studies. However, even if patients participate in initial human\ntesting and a Phase 1/2 study is carried out, the sponsor is still responsible for obtaining all the data usually obtained in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.\nU.S. law requires that studies conducted to support approval for product marketing be “adequate and well controlled.” In general, this means that\neither a placebo or a product already approved for the treatment of the disease or condition under study must be used as an active reference control,\nhowever, if testing in a patient population that does not have an approved treatment and where it would be unethical to only provide a placebo, single-arm,\nopen label studies may be acceptable in coordination with the FDA. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with good clinical practice\nrequirements, and informed consent must be obtained from all study subjects. The clinical study process for a new compound can take ten years or more to\ncomplete.\nAt any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and\nimpose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. The FDA may prevent clinical studies from beginning or may place clinical studies on hold at any point in\nthis process if, among other reasons, it concludes that study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In this case, the IND sponsor and the\nFDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin or resume. Studies may also be prevented from beginning or may be terminated\nby institutional review boards, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported\nduring clinical studies can delay, impede, or prevent marketing authorization. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing authorization can\nresult in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, the termination of ongoing clinical trials and withdrawal of the product\nfrom the market.\nSubmission of NDA\nFollowing the completion of clinical studies, the data are analyzed to determine whether the studies support an application for product approval. In the\nU.S., if the product is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA must include,\namong other things, a substantial amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from preclinical,\nlaboratory, animal, toxicology and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed\nproduct labeling.\nEach domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA and\nmust be registered with the FDA. The application generally will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the\napplicable manufacturing process and determines that the facility is in compliance with cGMP requirements. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the\nFDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an\napplicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the\npotential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the\ndisease or condition to be treated by the drug, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse\nevents, and whether the product is a new molecular entity.\nUnder the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing an NDA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees\nfor commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees can be significant. For fiscal year 2024, the application fee for an\napplication requiring clinical data alone is $4,048,695, although we may qualify for a waiver of these FDA filing fees since we are a small business entity.\nIn addition, the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program fees. Application and program fees are typically increased annually.\nEach NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness to permit a substantive review within 60 days following\nreceipt of the application. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA may\nrequest additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application\n19\nTable of Contents\nmust be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the\nsubmission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs—\nsix months from the filing date for applications subject to priority review and ten months from the filing date for applications subject to standard review.\nHowever, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time.\nThe FDA’s review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. The FDA is required to\nrefer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of\nindependent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application\nshould be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such\nrecommendations carefully when making decisions.\nOn the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities,\nthe FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific\nprescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require\nsubstantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the\nFDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA intends to review such resubmissions in two or six\nmonths depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the\napplication does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\nEven if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that\nwarning statements be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies, including Phase 4 studies, be conducted following approval as a\ncondition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit\nthe scope of any approval. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance\nprograms. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling\nclaims, are subject to further testing requirements and submission to the FDA of a supplemental NDA (sNDA), which may require FDA review and\napproval. prior to implementation. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and\nthe FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.\nExpedited Approval Pathways\nThe FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a\nserious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and Priority\nReview designation. In addition, accelerated approval offers the potential for approval based on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint. In May 2014,\nthe FDA published a final Guidance for Industry titled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions Drugs and Biologics,” which provides guidance on the\nFDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drug candidates as well as threshold criteria generally applicable\nto concluding that a drug candidate is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs.\nThe FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the\ntreatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for\nsuch a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a\nFast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary\nevaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve,\na schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s review clock for a Fast\nTrack application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA\nif the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.\nA product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a\nserious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over\nexisting available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as\n20\nTable of Contents\nsubstantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including\nholding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and\napproval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross disciplinary project lead for the review team; rolling review; and, taking other\nsteps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.\nThe FDA intends to review applications for standard review drug products within ten months of the 60-day filing date; and applications for priority\nreview drugs within six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines treat a serious condition, and if approved, would offer a\nsignificant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant\nimprovement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the\ntreatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that\nmay lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation.\nRPDD by the FDA enables priority review voucher (PRV) eligibility upon U.S. market approval of a designated drug for rare pediatric diseases. The\nRPDD-PRV program is intended to encourage development of therapies to prevent and treat rare pediatric diseases. The voucher, which is awarded upon\nNDA or BLA approval to the sponsor of a designated RPDD can be sold or transferred to another entity and used by the holder to receive priority review\nfor a future NDA or BLA submission, which reduces the FDA review time of such future submission from ten to six months.\nAccelerated Approval Pathway\nThe FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to\npatients over available treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical\nbenefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such drug for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical\nendpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM\nor other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs\ngranted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.\nFor the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or\nother measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more\neasily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably\nlikely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate\nclinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint\nis not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the\nultimate clinical benefit of a drug. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended\nperiod of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs\nrapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the\ngoal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large\ntrials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.\nThe accelerated approval pathway is contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory\nstudies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing\ncompliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to\nconduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the\nmarket on an expedited basis. In addition, all promotional materials for drugs approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the\nFDA.\nPost NDA Regulation\nSignificant and pervasive continuing legal and regulatory requirements also apply after FDA approval to market under an NDA. These include, among\nother things, requirements related to adverse event and other reporting, product advertising and promotion, and ongoing adherence to cGMP requirements,\nas well as the need to submit appropriate new or supplemental applications and obtain\n21\nTable of Contents\nFDA approval for certain changes to the approved product labeling, or manufacturing process. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription\nDrug Marketing Act and its implementing regulations which, among other things, impose various requirements in connection with the distribution of\nproduct samples to physicians. The FDA also enforces the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulates the distribution and tracing of\nprescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, sets minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states, and\nimposes requirements to track and trace drug products, ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate\nproducts from the market.\nIn addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their\nestablishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance\nwith cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented.\nFDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the\nsponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort\nin the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.\nOnce an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if\nproblems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of\nunanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the\napproved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution\nor other restrictions under a REMS program.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for\nthe approved indications and consistent with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations\nprohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.\nHowever, physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. The FDA does not regulate the\nbehavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but the FDA does restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their\nproducts.\nThe regulatory framework applicable to the production, distribution, marketing and/or sale of our product pipeline may change significantly from the\ncurrent descriptions provided herein in the time that it may take for any of our products to reach a point at which an NDA is approved.\nOverall research, development, and approval times depend on a number of factors, including the period of review at the FDA, the number of questions\nposed by the FDA during review, how long it takes to respond to the FDA’s questions, the severity or life-threatening nature of the disease in question, the\navailability of alternative treatments, the availability of clinical investigators and eligible patients, the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical studies, and\nthe risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical studies.\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally\nmeaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the US, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing\nand making a drug product available in the US for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must\nrequest ODD before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. ODD does not shorten the goal dates for the regulatory review and\napproval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the application fee. After the FDA grants ODD, the\nname of the drug and its potential orphan-designated use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.\nIf a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product\ngenerally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for\nthe same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a\ndifferent drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an\norphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be\nentitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the\n22\nTable of Contents\nsame drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major\ncontribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.\nPediatric Studies and Exclusivity\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and\neffectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each\npediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of\n2012 (the FDASIA), sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data.\nThose plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design,\nany deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then\nreview the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at\nany time.\nThe FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of\nthe product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral\nrequests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not\napply to products with orphan designation.\nPediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six\nmonths of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month\nexclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not\nneed to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the\nadditional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits,\nwhatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term\nextension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs\nIn 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme allowing the FDA to\napprove generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant\nto NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) to the agency. An ANDA is a\ncomprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug\nproduct formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality\ncontrol procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.\nInstead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product\npreviously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD).\nSpecifically, for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the\nroute of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. An applicant may submit an ANDA suitability petition to request the FDA’s prior\npermission to submit an abbreviated application for a drug that differs from the RLD in route of administration, dosage form, or strength, or for a drug that\nhas one different active ingredient in a fixed combination drug product (i.e., a drug product with multiple active ingredients). At the same time, the FDA\nmust also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate\nand extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.” Upon approval of an\nANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with\nTherapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists may consider a therapeutic equivalent generic\ndrug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation\nof therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.\n23\nTable of Contents\n505(b)(2) New Drug Applications\nAs an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by the FDA pursuant to an NDA, an\napplicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and\npermits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant, and\nfor which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous findings of safety\nand effectiveness is scientifically and legally appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new\nproduct. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional bridging studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from\nthe previously approved reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the\nreference drug has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.\nHatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-month Stay\nIn seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product.\nUpon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Orange Book.\nWhen an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the\nreference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that\nthe Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning\nany patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Specifically, the applicant must certify\nthat (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a\nparticular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA\napplicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented\nmethod-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent, known as a Section VIII statement. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents,\nthe ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product\nwill not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant\nhas provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders\nonce the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the\nnotice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification\nautomatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision\nin the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.\nPatent Term Extension\nAfter NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension, which permits patent term restoration as\ncompensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory process. The allowable patent term extension is typically calculated as one-half the time\nbetween the effective date of an IND application and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between NDA submission date and the NDA approval\ndate up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The\ntotal patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible\nfor extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the\napplication for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. However, we may not be granted an extension because of,\nfor example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to\napply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements.\n24\nTable of Contents\nExclusivity Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments\nIn addition, under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a particular drug until any\napplicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new\ndrug containing a new chemical entity (NCE). For the purposes of this provision, an NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been\napproved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug\nsubstance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of\nfive years from the date the NDA is approved, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may\nsubmit its application four years following the original product approval.\nThe FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than\nbioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year\nexclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or\nindication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory\nrequirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from\naccepting ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product; it does,\nhowever, block the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs during the period of exclusivity. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of\ndata exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.\nOther U.S. Regulatory Requirements\nIn the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are subject to regulation by\nvarious federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other agencies of the\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services), the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. Restrictions under applicable\nhealthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n● the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which is a criminal law that prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully\nsoliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of\nan individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a\nfederal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value.\nThe intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care\nand Education Reconciliation Act (the Affordable Care Act) to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual\nknowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been\ninterpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers\non the other, including, for example, consulting/speaking arrangements, discount and rebate offers, grants, charitable contributions, and patient\nsupport offerings, among others. A conviction for violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in criminal fines and/or imprisonment\nand requires mandatory exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Exclusion may also be imposed if the government\ndetermines that an entity has committed acts that are prohibited by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although there are a number of statutory\nexceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from\nprosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration to those who\nprescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as speakers\nor consultants, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor;\n25\nTable of Contents\n● the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the civil False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibits,\namong other things, (i) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent; (ii)\nknowingly making, or using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim; (iii) knowingly\nmaking, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government; or (iv) knowingly\nconcealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Private\nindividuals, commonly known as “whistleblowers,” can bring FCA qui tam actions, on behalf of the government and may share in amounts paid\nby the entity to the government in recovery or settlement. Pharmaceutical companies have been investigated and/or subject to government\nenforcement actions asserting liability under the FCA in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price\nconcessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free\nproduct to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. In addition, a claim including\nitems or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA.\nMoreover, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are\ndeemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the\nstatute provides for treble damages and significant mandatory penalties per false or fraudulent claim or statement for violations. Such per-claim\npenalties are currently set at $13,508 to $27,018 per false claim or statement for penalties assessed after January 30, 2023, with respect to\nviolations occurring after November 2, 2015. Criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, are also possible for making or\npresenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government;\n● the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other\nthings, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including any third-party payors, knowingly and\nwillfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and\nknowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or\nrepresentations, or making false statements relating to healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a\nperson or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n● HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations,\nwhich impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of\nindividually identifiable health information, including protected health information (PHI). HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary\npenalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new\nauthority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated\nwith pursuing federal civil actions;\n● the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs,\ndevices, biologics and medical supplies, among others, to report annually to the CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of\nvalue made by that entity to U.S. licensed physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), teaching\nhospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants,\ncertified nurse midwives, and U.S. teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate\nfamily members;\n● analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing\narrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private\ninsurers.\n26\nTable of Contents\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is\npossible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes,\nregulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and\nwe are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition\nof civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and\noversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, possible\nexclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and\ncurtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur research and development, manufacturing, and administration of our drugs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals\nand radioactive materials, such as radioactive isotopes. Therefore, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the storage, use\nand disposal of these materials and some waste products and are required to maintain both a manufacturer’s license and a radioactive materials license with\nState of Wisconsin agencies.\nMoreover, we are now, and may become subject to, additional federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies relating to safe working\nconditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and/or the use, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of human tissue, waste, and\nhazardous substances, including radioactive and toxic materials and infectious disease agents used in conjunction with our research work.\nForeign Regulatory Requirements\nWe, and any future collaborative partners, may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations that may be quite different from those of the FDA\ngoverning clinical studies, manufacture, product registration and approval, and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we\nor any future collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the\ncommencement of product marketing in these countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The\napproval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current U.S.\nlaw, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that\ncountry.\nReimbursement and Pricing Controls\nIn many of the markets where we, or any future collaborative partners would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of\npharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls by law and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Public and\nprivate health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the\nmanufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a\ntherapeutic class. Payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or\notherwise covered. In particular, many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either\napproved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug\ncompendium.\nPursuant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1396r-8(a)(1)), we will be required to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program\n(MDRP) for federal payment to be available for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Medicaid is a government health insurance program for\neligible low-income adults, children, families, pregnant women, and people with certain disabilities. It is jointly funded by the federal and state\ngovernments, and it is administered by individual states within parameters established by the federal government. As a result, coverage and reimbursement\nrequirements for drugs and biologics vary by state. For example, drugs and biologics may be covered under the medical or pharmacy benefit, and state\nMedicaid programs may impose different utilization management controls, such as prior authorization, step therapy, or quantity limits on drugs and\nbiologics, subject to federal limitations for such controls. But all states must generally provide coverage and reimbursement for a manufacturer’s covered\noutpatient drugs, as that term is defined by applicable law, if a manufacturer participates in the MDRP.\n27\nTable of Contents\nUnder the MDRP, we will be required to, among other things, pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for quantities of our products utilized on an\noutpatient basis (with some exceptions) that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program. MDRP rebates are\ncalculated using a statutory formula, state-reported utilization data, and pricing data that are calculated and reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis\nto CMS. These data include the average manufacturer price and, in the case of single source and innovator multiple source products, the best price for each\ndrug.\nIn addition to participating in the MDRP, federal law requires manufacturers to participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program\nfor federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating\nmanufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs.\nThese 340B covered entities only include health care organizations that have certain federal designations or receive funding from specific federal\nprograms, including Federally Qualified Health Centers, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees, and certain types of hospitals and specialized clinics, as\nwell as certain hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include\nadditional types of covered entities: certain children’s hospitals, certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, certain rural referral centers\nand certain sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. However, “orphan drugs” i.e., those designated under section 526 of the\nfederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) are exempted from the ceiling price requirements for these eligible entities added by the Affordable Care\nAct (except for certain children’s hospitals). The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the average manufacturer\nprice and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the MDRP, and in general, products subject to the MDRP are also subject to the\n340B ceiling price calculation and discount requirement. In addition, after multiple delays, the final rule implementing civil monetary penalties against\nmanufacturers for instances of overcharging 340B covered entities became effective on January 1, 2019. Accordingly, we could be subject to such penalties\nif the government were to find that we knowingly and intentionally overcharged a 340B covered entity.\nFederal law requires that for a company to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B\nprograms as well as to be purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, it also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federal\nSupply Schedule (FSS) pricing program. To participate, we will be required to enter into an FSS contract and other agreements with the VA for our\nproducts, which may qualify as “covered drugs.” Under these agreements, we would need to make our products available to the “Big Four” federal\nagencies—the VA, the Department of Defense (DoD), the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service), and the Coast Guard—at pricing\nthat is capped pursuant to a statutory federal ceiling price, or FCP, formula set forth in Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (VHCA). The\nFCP is based on a weighted average non-federal average manufacturer price (Non-FAMP), which manufacturers are required to report on a quarterly and\nannual basis to the VA. Pursuant to the VHCA, the knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a\nmanufacturer to a penalty for each item of false information and could result in other potential liability as well, including liability under the False Claims\nAct.\nFSS contracts are federal procurement contracts that include standard government terms and conditions, separate pricing for each product, and\nextensive disclosure and certification requirements. All items on FSS contracts are subject to a standard FSS contract clause that requires FSS contract\nprice reductions under certain circumstances where pricing is reduced to an agreed “tracking customer.” Further, in addition to the “Big Four” agencies, all\nother federal agencies and some non-federal entities are authorized to purchase off FSS contracts. FSS contractors are permitted to charge FSS purchasers\nother than the Big Four agencies “negotiated pricing” for covered drugs that is not capped by the FCP; instead, such pricing is negotiated based on a\nmandatory disclosure of the contractor’s commercial “most favored customer” pricing.\nIn addition, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, each\nof our covered drugs will be listed on an agreement with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) under which we will agree to honor the “Big Four” pricing for\nour products when they are dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE retail network pharmacies. More specifically, we will agree to provide\nrebates (or refunds) on such utilization. Companies are required to enter into a DHA Agreement for “covered drug” products for the covered drug to be\neligible for DoD formulary inclusion and available to TRICARE beneficiaries without preauthorization. The formula for determining the rebate is\nestablished in the regulations and our DHA agreement and is based on the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and the FCP (as described above,\nthese price points are required to be calculated by us under the VHCA).\n28\nTable of Contents\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the pricing and reimbursement of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. There have\nbeen several recent US Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing,\nreview the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program\nreimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 were several drug price reporting and\ntransparency measures, such as a new requirement for certain Medicare plans to develop tools to display Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit\ninformation in real time and for group and health insurance issuers to report information on pharmacy benefit and drug costs to the Secretaries of the\nDepartments of Health and Human Services, Labor and the Treasury. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act of\n2021, which included among its provisions a sunset of the Affordable Care Act’s cap on pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability under the MDRP.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, manufacturers’ rebate liability was capped at 100% of the average manufacturer price for a covered outpatient drug.\nEffective January 1, 2024, manufacturers’ MDRP rebate liability will no longer be capped, potentially resulting in a manufacturer paying more in MDRP\nrebates than it receives on the sale of certain covered outpatient drugs. On February 2, 2022, the Biden Administration signaled its continued commitment\nto the Cancer Moonshot initiative, which was initially launched in 2016. In its announcement, the administration noted that its new goals under the\ninitiative include addressing inequities in order to ensure broader access to cutting-edge cancer therapeutics and investing in a robust pipeline for new\ntreatments. Additionally, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which implements substantial changes to the\nMedicare program, including drug pricing reforms and creation of new Medicare inflation rebates. Namely, the IRA imposes inflation rebates on drug\nmanufacturers for products reimbursed under Medicare Parts B and D if the prices of those products increase faster than inflation; implements changes to\nthe Medicare Part D benefit that, beginning in 2025, will cap beneficiary annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000, while imposing new discount\nobligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers; and beginning in 2026, establishes a “maximum fair price” for a fixed number of high expenditure\npharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D following a price negotiation process with CMS. On October 14, 2022,\nPresident Biden issued an Executive Order on Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans, which instructed the Secretary of the Department of\nHealth and Human Services to consider whether to select for testing by the CMS Innovation Center new health care payment and delivery models that\nwould lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Most recently,\non February 14, 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report in response to the October 14, 2022 Executive Order, which, among\nother things, selects three potential drug affordability and accessibility models to be tested by the CMS Innovation Center. Specifically, the report\naddresses: (1) a model that would allow Part D Sponsors to establish a “high-value drug list” setting the maximum co-payment amount for certain common\ngeneric drugs at $2; (2) a Medicaid-focused model that would establish a partnership between CMS, manufacturers, and state Medicaid agencies that\nwould result in multi-state outcomes-based agreements or certain cell and gene therapy drugs; and (3) a model that would adjust Medicare Part B payment\namounts for Accelerated Approval Program drugs to advance the developments of novel treatments.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological\nproduct pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing, cost disclosure and\ntransparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Thus, even if a product candidate is\napproved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels\nfor the product. It is likely that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts\nthat federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for a pharmaceutical\nmanufacturer’s products or additional pricing pressure.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had twenty employees, all of whom were full-time employees. Of these twenty employees, ten employees were engaged\nin research and development. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider\nour relationship with our employees to be good.\nOur human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new\nemployees, advisors and consultants. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plans is to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of\nstock-based compensation awards in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the\nbest of their abilities and achieve our objectives.\n29\nTable of Contents\nLegal Proceedings\nWe may be a party to proceedings in the ordinary course of business, however, we do not anticipate that the outcome of such matters and disputes will\nmaterially affect our financial statements.\nCorporate Information\nCellectar Biosciences, Inc., formerly known as Novelos Therapeutics, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware in June 1996. On April 8, 2011, the\nCompany entered into a business combination with Cellectar, Inc., a privately held Wisconsin corporation that designed and developed products to detect,\ntreat and monitor a wide variety of human cancers. On February 11, 2014, we changed our name to Cellectar Biosciences, Inc. Our common stock is listed\non the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol CLRB.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 100 Campus Drive, Florham Park, New Jersey 07932, and our telephone number is (608) 441-8120. Our\ncorporate website address is www.cellectar.com. Information contained on or accessible through our website is not a part of this annual report.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other\ninformation contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” and Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements,\" as well as our other filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, or SEC, before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In such an event, the market price of our\ncommon stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we\ncurrently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all of the risks discussed in Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, not just those discussed under this “Summary of Risk Factors” before making a decision to invest in our securities. The\nfollowing is a list of some of these risks:\n● We will require additional capital in order to continue our operations and may have difficulty raising additional capital.\n● We rely on a collaborative outsourced business model, and disruptions with our third-party collaborators, including potential disruptions at our\nsole source supplier of iopofosine, AtomVie may impede our ability to gain FDA approval and delay or impair commercialization of any\nproducts.\n● We cannot assure the successful development and commercialization of our compounds in development.\n● Failure to complete the development of our technologies, obtain government approvals, including required FDA approvals, or comply with\nongoing governmental regulations could prevent, delay or limit introduction or sale of proposed products and result in failure to achieve revenues\nor maintain our ongoing business.\n● The FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation, RPDD, to iopofosine for treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s\nsarcoma and osteosarcoma; however, we may not be able to realize any value from such designation.\n● Clinical studies involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future\nstudy results.\n● We may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical studies because of unexpected side effects or other safety risks that could preclude\napproval of our product candidates.\n30\nTable of Contents\n● Controls we or our third-party collaborators have in place to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations may not be effective.\n● We expect to rely on our patents as well as specialized regulatory designations such as orphan drug classification for our product candidates, but\nregulatory drug designations may not confer marketing exclusivity or other expected commercial benefits.\n● Fast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not assure\nFDA approval of our product candidates.\n● We rely on a small number of key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time, and our success will depend on our ability\nto hire additional qualified personnel.\n● Acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will prevent or delay our ability to generate\nrevenues.\n● Regulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA, the European Commission and other regulators to those specific indications\nand conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated, and we may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are\npromoting the “off-label” use of any of our future product candidates if approved.\n● Any product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain approval in the future, is subject to, or will be subject to,\nextensive ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities, and if we fail to comply with\nregulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, we may be subject to penalties, we may be unable to\ngenerate revenue from the sale of such products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to\nfund our operations will be increased.\n● The COVID-19 pandemic as well as conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters. public health crises, cyber-attacks and general\ninstability could materially adversely affect our business.\n● Failure to meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively impact the price of our\ncommon stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital.\n● Our stock price has experienced price fluctuations.\nRisks Related to Capital and Our Operations\nWe will require additional capital in order to continue our operations and may have difficulty raising additional capital.\nWe expect that we will continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated cash balance was\napproximately $9.6 million. We believe our cash balance as of December 31, 2023, in combination with the funds generated by the warrants exercised by\ninvestors in January 2024 (see Note 13 to our audited financial statements in Item 8 of this 10-K) is adequate to fund our basic budgeted operations into the\nfourth quarter of 2024.\nDuring the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed a private placement with certain institutional investors expected to result\nin gross proceeds of up to $102.9 million, including gross proceeds of $24.5 million which the Company received at closing. In January 2024, the\nCompany’s Tranche A warrants were all exercised resulting in gross proceeds of $44.1 million with net proceeds of approximately $42.8 million after\ndeducting estimated offering expenses (see Note 13 to our audited financial statements). The Company’s ability to execute its current operating plan\ndepends on its ability to obtain additional funding via the sale of equity and/or debt securities, a strategic transaction or other source of capital. The\nCompany plans to continue actively pursuing financing alternatives, however, there can be no assurance that it will obtain the necessary funding, raising\nsubstantial doubt\n31\nTable of Contents\nabout the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date these financial statements are issued. The accompanying financial\nstatements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur capital requirements and our ability to meet them depend on many factors, including:\n● the number of potential products and technologies in development;\n● continued progress and cost of our research and development programs;\n● progress with preclinical studies and clinical studies;\n● the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance;\n● costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims;\n● costs of developing sales, marketing and distribution channels and our ability to sell our drugs;\n● costs involved in establishing manufacturing capabilities for clinical study and commercial quantities of our drugs;\n● competing technological and market developments;\n● claims or enforcement actions with respect to our products or operations;\n● market acceptance of our products;\n● costs for recruiting and retaining management, employees and consultants;\n● our ability to manage computer system failures or security breaches;\n● costs for educating physicians regarding the application and use of our products;\n● whether we are able to maintain our listing on a national exchange;\n● uncertainty and economic instability resulting from conflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, public health crises, including\nthe occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the COVID-19 coronavirus, cyber-attacks and general instability; and\n● the condition of capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and globally.\nWe may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than expected. We\nmay seek to raise any additional funds through the issuance of any combination of common stock, preferred stock, warrants and debt financings or by\nexecuting collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources, any of which may be dilutive to existing stockholders or have a material\neffect on our current or future business prospects. If we cannot secure adequate financing when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or\neliminate one or more of our research and development programs or to enter into license or other arrangements with third parties to commercialize\nproducts or technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves. In the event that additional funds are obtained through\narrangements with collaborative partners or other sources, we may have to relinquish economic and/or proprietary rights to some of our technologies or\nproducts under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize by ourselves. In such an event, our business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could significantly disrupt our business and may prevent us from conducting business activities because of spread of the\ndisease, or as a result of shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by federal, state and local governmental authorities. Business disruptions have\nincluded restrictions on our ability to travel, as well as temporary closures. While we have not yet experienced any significant impacts as a result of the\npandemic other than delays in clinical trial enrollment, it is not possible at this time to estimate the ultimate impact that it could have on our business. The\ncontinued impacts of COVID-19 including new virus strains and the measures taken by government authorities have created uncertainties and could delay\nour ongoing clinical studies or the manufacture or shipment of iopofosine for clinical studies.\nConflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters. public health crises, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness,\nsuch as the COVID-19 coronavirus, cyber-attacks and general instability could adversely affect our business.\nConflicts, military actions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, public health crises and cyber-attacks have precipitated economic instability and turmoil\nin financial markets. Instability and turmoil may result in raw material cost increases. In addition, the long-term effects of climate change on general\neconomic conditions and the pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand or\navailable sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods\nand services, including raw materials and other natural resources, necessary to run our businesses. The uncertainty and economic disruption resulting from\nhostilities, military action, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, public health crises or cyber-attacks may impact our operations or those of our suppliers.\nAccordingly, any conflict, military action, terrorist attack, natural disasters, public health crises or cyber-attack that impacts us or any of our suppliers,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWar, terrorism, other acts of violence, or natural or manmade disasters may affect the markets in which we operate, our patients and resources\nrequired in our research and development activities.\nOur business may be adversely affected by political instability, disruption or destruction in a geographic region in which we operate, regardless of\ncause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, and natural or manmade disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm\nor pandemic events and spread of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant military action against Ukraine by Russia. Such events may\naffect our business by increasing prices for resources required in our research and development activities or limiting our access to patients for our clinical\ntrials which may delay our progress on one or more of our clinical or preclinical drug product candidates.\nOur business and operations may be materially adversely affected in the event of computer system failures or security breaches.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our third-party manufacturers, contract research\norganizations and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, phishing\nattempts, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and interrupt our operations, it\ncould result in a material disruption in our business. For example, the loss of clinical study data from ongoing or planned clinical studies could result in\ndelays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security\nbreach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, loss of trade secrets, inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information,\nincluding protected health information or personal data of employees or former employees, lack of access to our clinical data, or disruption of the\nmanufacturing process, we could incur liability and the further development of our drug candidates could be delayed. We may also be vulnerable to cyber-\nattacks or other malfeasance by hackers. This type of breach of our cybersecurity may compromise our confidential and financial information, adversely\naffect our business, or result in legal proceedings. Further, these cybersecurity breaches may inflict reputational harm upon us that may result in decreased\nmarket value and erode public trust.\nFailure to meet investor and stakeholder expectations regarding environmental, social and corporate governance, or “ESG” matters may damage\nour reputation.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, employees and other stakeholders concerning ESG matters. Additionally, public interest and\nlegislative pressure related to public companies’ ESG practices continue to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet\n33\nTable of Contents\ninvestor, employee or other stakeholders’ evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental\nstewardship, Board of Directors and employee diversity, human capital management, corporate governance and transparency, our reputation, brand, appeal\nto investors and employee retention may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the Code). The limitations apply if we experience an “ownership change”, generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage\npoint change in the ownership of our equity by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply. We\nhave not evaluated whether such an ownership change has occurred previously. If we have experienced an ownership change at any time since our\nformation, we may already be subject to limitations on our ability to utilize our existing net operating losses and other tax attributes to offset taxable\nincome. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, the\nlimitations under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. As a result, if or when we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our net operating loss\ncarryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could adversely affect our future cash flows.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing and Supply\nWe rely on a collaborative outsourced business model, and disruptions with our third-party collaborators, including potential disruptions at our\nsole source supplier of iopofosine, AtomVie, may impede our ability to gain FDA approval and delay or impair commercialization of any products.\nWe are in the preclinical and clinical study phases of product development and commercialization. We have closed manufacturing operations located at\nour former corporate headquarters in Wisconsin and have implemented a collaboration outsourcing model to more efficiently manage costs. We rely\nsignificantly on contracts with third parties to use their facilities to conduct our research, development and manufacturing.\nWe have engaged AtomVie, which has been a validated cGMP manufacturing organization specializing in radiopharmaceuticals, as our exclusive\nsource to supply drug product for our ongoing research and clinical studies, including our Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of iopofosine.\nIn addition, we rely exclusively on contract research organizations to conduct research and development. Any inability of these organizations to fulfill\nthe requirements of their agreements with us may delay or impair our ability to gain FDA approval and commercialization of our drug delivery technology\nand products.\nOur reliance on third-party collaborators exposes us to risks related to not being able to directly oversee the activities of these parties. Furthermore,\nthese collaborators, whether foreign or domestic, may experience regulatory compliance difficulties, mechanical shutdowns, employee strikes, or other\nunforeseeable acts that may delay fulfillment of their agreements with us. This may lead to the stopping or delay of our clinical trials or commercial\nmanufacturing activity. For example, in 2018, our CMO, AtomVie, was placed on import alert following an FDA inspection, which resulted in our studies\nbeing placed on a clinical hold, until we received an FDA exception allowing us to import our study drug for use in clinical trials. The import alert on\nAtomVie was removed in 2019. Failure of any of these collaborators to provide the required services in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable\nterms could materially delay the development and approval of our products, increase our expenses, and materially harm our business, prospects, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon these third-party manufacturers may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize\nproduct candidates on a timely and competitive basis, which could have an adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. If we were\nrequired to transfer manufacturing processes to other third-party manufacturers and we were able to identify an alternative manufacturer, we would still\nneed to satisfy various regulatory requirements. Satisfaction of these requirements could cause us to experience significant delays in receiving an adequate\nsupply of our products and products in development and could be costly. Moreover, we may not be able to transfer processes that are proprietary to the\nmanufacturer, if any. These manufacturers may not be able to produce material on a timely basis or manufacture material at the quality level or in the\nquantity required to meet our development timelines and applicable regulatory requirements and may also experience a shortage in qualified personnel,\nincluding as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to maintain or renew our existing third-party manufacturing\narrangements, or enter into new arrangements, on acceptable terms, or at all. Our third-party\n34\nTable of Contents\nmanufacturers could terminate or decline to renew our manufacturing arrangements based on their own business priorities, at a time that is costly or\ninconvenient for us. If we are unable to contract for the production of materials in sufficient quantity and of sufficient quality on acceptable terms, our\nplanned clinical trials may be significantly delayed. Manufacturing delays could postpone the filing of our IND applications and/or the initiation or\ncompletion of clinical trials that we have currently planned or may plan in the future.\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the EMA, national\ncompetent authorities in the EU and UK and other federal and state government and regulatory agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other\ngovernment regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations\nand standards and they may not be able to comply. Switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It\nmay be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, if we are required to enter into\nnew supply arrangements, we may not be able to obtain approval from the FDA of any alternate supplier in a timely manner, or at all, which could delay or\nprevent the clinical development and commercialization of any related product candidates. Failure of our third-party manufacturers or us to comply with\napplicable regulations, whether because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including\nfines, civil penalties, delays in or failure to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, injunctions, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals,\nlicense revocation, seizures or recalls of products and compounds, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, warning or similar letters or civil,\ncriminal or administrative sanctions against the company, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that we have a good working relationship with our third-party collaborators. However, should the situation change, we may be required to\nrelocate these activities on short notice, and we do not currently have access to alternate facilities to which we could relocate our research, development\nand/or manufacturing activities. The cost and time to establish or locate an alternate research, development and/or manufacturing facility to develop our\ntechnology would be substantial and would delay obtaining FDA approval and commercializing our products.\nFurthermore, if our products are approved for commercial sale, we will need to work with our existing third-party collaborators to ensure sufficient\ncapacity, or engage additional parties with the capacity, to commercially manufacture our products in accordance with FDA and other regulatory\nrequirements. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully establish any such capacity or identify suitable manufacturing partners on\nacceptable terms.\nRisks Related to Research and Development and the FDA\nWe cannot assure the successful development and commercialization of our compounds in development.\nAt present, our success is dependent on one or more of the following to occur: the successful development of iopofosine for the treatment of a\nhematologic or solid tumor cancer including Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma and B-Cell lymphomas or the treatment of pediatric\nsolid tumors and lymphomas; the development of new PDCs, specifically new products developed from our PDC program, and the advancement of our\nPDC agents through research and development; and/or commercialization partnerships.\nWe are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of\ncancer. We leverage our PDC platform to specifically target cancer cells. The PDC platform possesses the potential for the discovery and development of\nthe next generation of cancer-targeting agents. The PDC platform features include the capacity to link with almost any molecule, the delivery of a\nsignificant increase in targeted oncologic payload, and the ability to target all tumor cells. As a result, we believe that we can generate PDCs to treat a\nbroad range of cancers with the potential to improve the therapeutic index of oncologic drug payloads, enhance or maintain efficacy while reducing\nadverse events by minimizing drug delivery to healthy cells, and increase delivery to cancerous cells and cancer stem cells.\nOur proposed products and their potential applications are in clinical and manufacturing/process development and face a variety of risks and\nuncertainties inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products, including the following:\n● The inherent difficulty in selecting the right drug and drug target and avoiding unwanted side effects, as well as unanticipated problems relating to\nproduct development, testing, enrollment, obtaining regulatory approvals, maintaining regulatory compliance, manufacturing, competition and\ncosts and expenses that may exceed current estimates;\n35\nTable of Contents\n● Future clinical study results may show that our cancer-targeting and delivery technologies are not well-tolerated by patients at their effective\ndoses or are not efficacious. In future clinical trials, we or our partners may discover additional side effects and/or a higher frequency of side\neffects than those observed in previously completed clinical trials.\n● Future clinical study results may be inconsistent with testing results obtained to-date. The results of preliminary and mid-stage clinical trials do\nnot necessarily predict clinical or commercial success, and larger later-stage clinical trials may fail to confirm the results observed in the previous\nclinical trials.\n● A clinical trial may show that a product candidate is safe and effective for certain patient populations in a particular indication, but other clinical\ntrials may fail to confirm those results in a subset of that population or in a different patient population, which may limit the potential market for\nthat product candidate.\n● Even if our cancer-targeting and delivery technologies are shown to be safe and effective for their intended purposes, we may face significant or\nunforeseen difficulties in obtaining or manufacturing sufficient quantities at reasonable prices or at all.\n● Our ability to complete the development and commercialization of our cancer-targeting and delivery technologies for their intended use is\nsubstantially dependent upon our ability to raise sufficient capital or to obtain and maintain experienced and committed partners to assist us with\nobtaining clinical and regulatory approvals for, and the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of, our products.\n● Even if our cancer-targeting and delivery technologies are successfully developed, approved by all necessary regulatory authorities, and\ncommercially produced, there is no guarantee that there will be market acceptance of our products.\n● Our competitors may develop therapeutics or other treatments that are superior or less costly than our own with the result that our product\ncandidates, even if they are successfully developed, manufactured and approved, may not generate sufficient revenues to offset the development\nand manufacturing costs of our product candidates.\nIf we are unsuccessful in dealing with any of these risks, or if we are unable to successfully advance the development of our cancer-targeting and\ndelivery technologies for some other reason, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to our own compounds in development, we have established anticipated timelines with respect to the initiation of clinical trials based on\nexisting knowledge of the compounds. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will meet any of these timelines for clinical development.\nAdditionally, the initial results of a completed earlier clinical trial of a product candidate do not necessarily predict final results and the results may not be\nrepeated in later clinical trials.\nBecause of the uncertainty of whether the accumulated preclinical evidence (PK, pharmacodynamic, safety and/or other factors) or early clinical\nresults will be observed in later clinical trials, we can make no assurances regarding the likely results from our future clinical trials or the impact of those\nresults on our business.\nFailure to complete the development of our technologies, obtain government approvals, including required FDA approvals, or comply with\nongoing governmental regulations could prevent, delay or limit introduction or sale of proposed products and result in failure to achieve revenues\nor maintain our ongoing business.\nOur research and development activities and the manufacture and marketing of our intended products are subject to extensive regulation for safety,\nefficacy and quality by numerous government authorities in the U.S. and abroad. Before receiving approval to market our proposed products by the FDA,\nwe will have to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for the patient population for the diseases that are to be treated. Clinical studies,\nmanufacturing and marketing of drugs are subject to the rigorous testing and approval process of the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities.\nThe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing, manufacturing,\nlabeling, advertising, distribution and promotion of drugs and medical devices. As a result, clinical studies and regulatory approval can take many years to\naccomplish and require the expenditure of substantial financial, managerial and other resources.\nWe cannot predict whether regulatory clearance or approval will be obtained for any product that we hope to develop. Of particular significance to us\nare the requirements relating to research and development and testing. The activities associated with the\n36\nTable of Contents\nresearch, development and commercialization of iopofosine and other future candidates in our pipeline must undergo extensive clinical trials, which can\ntake many years and require substantial expenditures, subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and by\ncomparable authorities in other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is expensive, and\nlengthy, if approval is obtained at all.\nBefore commencing clinical trials in humans, we, or our collaborative partners, will need to submit and receive approval from the FDA of an IND\napplication. Clinical trials are subject to oversight by institutional review boards and the FDA and:\n● must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s good clinical practices and other applicable regulations;\n● must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight;\n● must meet requirements for informed consent;\n● are subject to continuing FDA and regulatory oversight;\n● may require large numbers of test subjects; and\n● may be suspended by us, our collaborators or the FDA at any time if it is believed that the subjects participating in these trials are being exposed\nto unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in the IND or the conduct of these trials.\nWe do not know whether we will be permitted to undertake clinical trials of potential products beyond the trials already concluded and the trials\ncurrently in process. It will take us or our collaborative partners several years to complete any such testing, and failure can occur at any stage of testing.\nInterim results of trials do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials. A number of\ncompanies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after\nachieving promising results in earlier trials.\nBefore receiving FDA approval or similar approval in the European Union or other jurisdiction to market a product, we must demonstrate with\nsubstantial clinical evidence that the product is safe and effective in the patient population and the indication that will be treated. Data obtained from\npreclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Our clinical trials may\nfail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The regulatory process also requires preclinical testing, and\ndata obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations. In connection with clinical trials of our product candidates,\nwe may face the following risks among others:\n● the product candidate may not prove to be effective;\n● the product candidate may cause harmful side effects;\n● the clinical results may not replicate the results of earlier, smaller trials;\n● we or third parties with whom we collaborate, may be significantly impacted by the evolving impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n● we, or the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities, may delay, terminate or suspend the trials;\n● our results may not be statistically significant;\n● patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than expected;\n● patients may drop out of the trials or otherwise not enroll; and\n● regulatory and clinical trial requirements, interpretations or guidance may change.\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to approve any NDA or sNDA and decide that our data is insufficient for\napproval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. Varying interpretations of the data obtained\n37\nTable of Contents\nfrom preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of our products for any individual, additional indications.\nTo be commercially viable, we must successfully research, develop, manufacture, introduce, obtain the required regulatory approval described above\nfor, our product candidates, in order to market and distribute our product candidates. This includes meeting a number of critical developmental milestones,\nincluding:\n● demonstrating benefit from delivery of each specific drug for specific medical indications;\n● demonstrating through preclinical and clinical studies that each drug is safe and effective; and\n● demonstrating that we have established viable FDA cGMPs capable of potential scale-up.\nThe timeframe necessary to achieve these developmental milestones may be long and uncertain, and we may not successfully complete these\nmilestones for any of our intended products in development.\nIn addition to the risks previously discussed, our technology is subject to developmental risks that include the following:\n● uncertainties arising from the rapidly growing scientific aspects of drug therapies and potential treatments;\n● uncertainties arising as a result of the broad array of alternative potential treatments related to cancer and other diseases; and\n● expense and time associated with the development and regulatory approval of treatments for cancer and other diseases.\nIn addition, delays or rejections may be encountered based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or\nchanges in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or\nother applicable regulatory requirements may result in criminal prosecution, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of\nproduction or injunction, adverse publicity, as well as other regulatory action against our potential products or us.\nTo conduct the clinical studies that are necessary to obtain approval by the FDA to market a product, it is necessary to receive clearance from the FDA\nto conduct such clinical studies. The FDA can halt clinical studies at any time for safety reasons or because we or our clinical investigators do not follow\nthe FDA’s requirements for conducting clinical studies. If any of our studies are halted, we will not be able to obtain FDA approval until and unless we can\naddress the FDA’s concerns. If we are unable to receive clearance to conduct clinical studies for a product, we will not be able to achieve any revenue from\nthat product in the U.S., as it is illegal to sell any drug for use in humans in the U.S. without FDA approval.\nIf regulatory approval of a product is granted, this approval will be limited to those indications or disease states and conditions for which the product is\ndemonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and efficacious. We cannot assure you that any compound developed by us, alone or with others, will prove\nto be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval.\nEven if we do ultimately receive FDA approval for any of our products, these products will be subject to extensive ongoing regulation, including\nregulations governing manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, prescription and procurement quotas, record keeping, reporting, handling,\nshipment and disposal of any such drug. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or to comply with any applicable regulations could further\ndelay or preclude development and commercialization of our drugs and subject us to enforcement action.\nOutside the US, our ability, or that of our collaborative partners, to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the\nappropriate regulatory authorities. This foreign regulatory approval process typically includes all of the risks and costs associated with FDA approval\ndescribed above and may also include additional risks and costs, such as the risk that such foreign regulatory authorities, which often have different\nregulatory and clinical trial requirements, interpretations and guidance from the FDA, may require additional clinical trials or results for approval of a\nproduct candidate, any of which could result in delays, significant additional costs or failure to obtain such regulatory approval. There can be no assurance,\nhowever, that we or our collaborative partners will not have to provide additional information or analysis, or conduct additional clinical trials, before\nreceiving approval to market product candidates.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation, RPDD, to iopofosine for treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s\nsarcoma and osteosarcoma; however, we may not be able to realize any value from such designation.\nIopofosine has received RPDD designation from the FDA for the treatment of neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing’s\nsarcoma. The FDA defines a “rare pediatric disease” as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. primarily under the age of 18 years\nold, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the U.S. when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the\ndrug in the U.S. will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biological product. Under the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review\nVoucher Program, upon the approval of an NDA or a BLA for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease, the sponsor of such application could be eligible for\na Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher that can be redeemed to obtain priority review for a subsequent NDA or BLA. The sponsor of a rare\npediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be\nfurther transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application.\nThe FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the U.S.\nwithin one year following the date of approval. In addition, the priority review voucher is only awarded to an NCE. Thus, if iopofosine is approved first for\nan indication that is not a rare pediatric disease, our application may not be eligible to receive the voucher. There is no assurance we will receive a Rare\nPediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher or that it will result in a faster development process, review or approval for a subsequent marketing application.\nAlso, although Priority Review Vouchers may be sold or transferred to third parties, there is no guaranty that we will be able to realize any value if we were\nto sell a Priority Review Voucher. In December 2020, the Priority Review Voucher Program was extended by the FDA permitting additional grants through\nSeptember 2026 for rare pediatric diseases. It is possible that even if we obtain approval for iopofosine and qualify for a priority review voucher, the\nprogram may no longer be in effect at the time of such approval.\nClinical studies involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future\nstudy results.\nTo obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive clinical studies to\ndemonstrate safety and efficacy of these product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, it can take many years to complete, and its outcome is uncertain.\nFailure can occur at any time during the clinical study process.\nWe may experience delays in clinical testing of our product candidates. We do not know whether planned clinical studies will begin on time, need to\nbe redesigned, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical studies can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in obtaining regulatory\napproval to commence a study, reaching agreement on acceptable clinical study terms with prospective sites, obtaining institutional review board approval\nto conduct a study at a prospective site, recruiting patients to participate in a study, or obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical study materials. Many factors\naffect patient enrollment, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study,\ncompeting clinical studies, and new drugs approved for the conditions we are investigating. Prescribing physicians will also have to decide to use our\nproduct candidates over existing drugs that have established safety and efficacy profiles or other drugs undergoing development in clinical studies. Any\ndelays in completing our clinical studies will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process, and delay our ability to\ngenerate revenue.\nAdditionally, the results of preclinical studies and early clinical studies of our product candidates do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage\nclinical studies. Product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed\nthrough initial clinical testing. The data collected from clinical studies of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an\nNDA or to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere. Because of the uncertainties associated with drug development and regulatory approval, we\ncannot determine if or when we will have an approved product for commercialization or will achieve sales or profits.\nFurthermore, we typically rely on third-party clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials and other third-party organizations to oversee the\noperations of such trials and to perform data collection and analysis. The clinical investigators are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or\ntiming of resources that they devote to our programs. Failure of the third-party organizations to meet their obligations, whether because of the impacts of\nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could adversely affect clinical development of our products. As a result, we may face additional delaying\nfactors outside our control if these parties do not\n39\nTable of Contents\nperform their obligations in a timely fashion. For example, any number of those issues could arise with our clinical trials causing a delay. Delays of this\nsort could occur for the reasons identified above or other reasons. If we have delays in conducting the clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approvals, our\nproduct development costs will increase. For example, we may need to make additional payments to third-party investigators and organizations to retain\ntheir services or we may need to pay recruitment incentives. If the delays are significant, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product\ncandidates will be harmed, and our ability to become profitable will be delayed. Moreover, these third-party investigators and organizations may also have\nrelationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. If these third-party investigators and organizations assist our\ncompetitors at our expense, it could harm our competitive position.\nOur clinical studies may not demonstrate sufficient levels of efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our drugs, and our\nproposed drugs may not be approved for marketing.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical studies or trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number\nof eligible patients to participate in these clinical trials as required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, whether a result of the impacts of the\nongoing COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise. Even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, if the pace of enrollment is\nslower than we expect, the development costs for our product candidates may increase and the completion of our clinical trials may be delayed, or our\nclinical trials could become too expensive to complete. Significant delays in clinical testing could negatively impact our product development costs and\ntiming. Our estimates regarding timing are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions based on past experience with our other clinical\nprograms. If we are unable to enroll the patients in these trials at the projected rate, the completion of the clinical program could be delayed and the costs\nof conducting the program could increase, either of which could harm our business.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical studies because of unexpected side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval\nof our product candidates.\nOur clinical studies may be suspended at any time for a number of reasons. For example, we may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical studies\nif at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to the clinical study patients. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or\npermanent discontinuation of our clinical studies at any time if they believe that the clinical studies are not being conducted in accordance with applicable\nregulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to the clinical study patients.\nAdministering any product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects. These side effects could interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies\nof our product candidates and could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying further development or approval of our product candidates for\nany or all targeted indications. Ultimately, some or all of our product candidates may prove to be unsafe for human use. Moreover, we could be subject to\nsignificant liability if any volunteer or patient suffers, or appears to suffer, adverse health effects as a result of participating in our clinical studies.\n40\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance and Litigation\nControls we or our third-party collaborators have in place to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations may not be effective.\nWe and our third-party collaborators are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of hazardous\nmaterials and waste products. Current or future regulations may impair our research, development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts. The\ninability of our third-party collaborators to maintain the required licenses and permits for any reason will negatively impact our manufacturing, and\nresearch and development activities. In addition, we may be required to indemnify third-party collaborators against certain liabilities arising out of any\nfailure by them to comply with such regulations and/or laws. If we or our third-party collaborators fail to comply with any of these regulations and/or laws,\na range of consequences could result, including the suspension or termination of clinical studies, failure to obtain approval of a product candidate,\nrestrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government\nhealthcare programs, or other sanctions or litigation.\nWe are exposed to product, clinical and preclinical liability risks that could create a substantial financial burden should we be sued.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of\npharmaceutical products. In addition, the use in our clinical studies of pharmaceutical products that we, or our current or potential collaborators, may\ndevelop and then subsequently sell, may cause us to bear a portion of, or all, product liability risks. While we carry an insurance policy covering up to\n$5,000,000 per occurrence and $5,000,000 in the aggregate for liability incurred in connection with such claims should they arise, there can be no\nassurance that our insurance will be adequate to cover all situations. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such insurance, or additional insurance if\nrequired, will be available or, if available, will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, our current and potential partners with whom\nwe have collaborative agreements, or our future licensees, may not be willing to indemnify us against these types of liabilities and may not themselves be\nsufficiently insured or have a net worth sufficient to satisfy any product liability claims. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought\nagainst us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe expect to rely on our patents as well as specialized regulatory designations such as orphan drug classification for our product candidates, but\nregulatory drug designations may not confer marketing exclusivity or other expected commercial benefits.\nWe expect to file for ODD or other regulatory designations (fast track, break-through, priority review, etc.) as appropriate for our product candidates.\nWe have been granted ODD in the U.S. for iopofosine as a therapeutic for the treatment of multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma,\nrhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing’s sarcoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. Additionally, we have been granted ODD in\nEurope for iopofosine as a therapeutic for the treatment of multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is\ndefined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the US, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the US where there is no\nreasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the US. In the US, orphan drug designation entitles a party to\nfinancial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that\nhas orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan\ndrug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication\nfor seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the\nmanufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.\nEven though we have received ODD as described above, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the orphan-designated indication\nbecause of the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. For any product candidate for which we have been or will be granted\nODD in a particular indication, it is possible that another company also holding ODD for the\n41\nTable of Contents\nsame product candidate will receive marketing approval for the same indication before we do. If that were to happen, our applications for that indication\nmay not be approved until the competing company’s period of exclusivity expires. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the US for iopofosine for an\norphan-designated indication or any future product candidate may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated\nindication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure\nsufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. We will not be able to rely on it to exclude other\ncompanies from manufacturing or selling products using the same principal molecular structural features for the same indication beyond these timeframes\nwithout our patent portfolio. Even if we were the first to obtain marketing authorization for an orphan drug indication, there are circumstances under which\na competing product may be approved for the same indication during the seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, such as if the later product is shown\nto be clinically superior to the product with orphan exclusivity. Even after an orphan product is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same\ndrug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to\npatient care. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the US for iopofosine or any future product candidate may be limited if we seek approval for an\nindication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially\ndefective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nFurther, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because\ndifferent drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Further, the seven-year marketing exclusivity, if granted, would not\nprevent competitors from obtaining approval of the same product candidate as ours for indications other than those in which we have been granted ODD,\nor for other indications if not for our patent portfolio, or for the use of other types of products in the same indications as our orphan product. Furthermore,\nalthough the ODD and exclusivity are in effect right now, the FDA has the authority to modify this assessment at any time. Orphan drug designation\nneither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nIn addition, Congress is considering updates to the orphan drug provisions of the FDCA in response to a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit. Any changes to the orphan drug provisions could change our opportunities for, or likelihood of success in obtaining, orphan drug\nexclusivity and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFast track designation by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and does not assure\nFDA approval of our product candidates.\nIf a product candidate is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product candidate demonstrates the potential to\naddress unmet medical need for this condition, the sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. Fast track designation applies to the combination of\nthe product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions\nwith the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete\napplication is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA\nand determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.\nHowever, fast track designation does not change the standards for approval and does not ensure that the product candidate will receive marketing\napproval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. As a result, while the FDA has granted fast track designation to iopofosine for\nWM patients having received two or more prior treatment regimens and/or we may seek and receive fast track designation for our future product\ncandidates, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may\nwithdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Fast track\ndesignation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA’s priority review procedures.\nWe may face litigation from third parties claiming our products infringe on their intellectual property rights, particularly because there is often\nsubstantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of medical patents.\nWe may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our technologies, products or activities infringe on the intellectual property\nrights of others or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims\ncovered in medical technology patents, and the breadth and scope of trade-secret protection, involve complex legal and factual questions for which\nimportant legal principles are unresolved. Any litigation or claims against us,\n42\nTable of Contents\nwhether valid or not, could result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial and managerial resources, and harm our reputation. License\nagreements that we may enter into in the future would likely require that we pay the costs associated with defending this type of litigation. In addition,\nintellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n● cease selling, incorporating or using any of our technologies and/or products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, which would\nadversely affect our ability to generate revenue;\n● obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable\nterms, if at all; or\n● redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our rights to intellectual property or to secure rights to third-party patents, we may lose valuable\nrights, experience reduced market share, assuming any, or incur costly litigation to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur ability to obtain licenses to patents, maintain trade-secret protection, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others will be\nimportant to commercializing any products under development. Therefore, any disruption in access to the technology could substantially delay the\ndevelopment of our technology.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, such as ours, for products that involve licensing agreements are frequently\nuncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the\npatent is issued or in subsequent legal proceedings. Consequently, our patent applications and any issued and licensed patents may not provide protection\nagainst competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or circumvented. To the extent we license patents from third parties, the early\ntermination of any such license agreement would result in the loss of our rights to use the covered patents, which could severely delay, inhibit or eliminate\nour ability to develop and commercialize compounds based on the licensed patents. Our competitors may also independently develop products similar to\nours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued or licensed to us. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our\nproprietary rights to the same extent as U.S. law.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.\nAlthough we generally require our employees, consultants, advisors, and collaborators to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment-of-inventions\nagreements, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer our information\nand techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. We may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in trade secrets, technical\nknow-how and other non-patented technology.\nWe may have to resort to litigation to protect our rights for certain intellectual property or to determine the scope, validity or enforceability of our\nintellectual property rights. Enforcing or defending our rights would be expensive, could cause diversion of our resources, and may not prove successful.\nAny failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose the ability to exclude others from using our technology to develop or sell competing\nproducts.\nRisks Related to Our Employees\nWe rely on a small number of key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time, and our success will depend on our ability\nto hire additional qualified personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on the continued services of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, James V.\nCaruso. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time, and there can be no assurance that these\nindividuals will continue to provide services to us. Our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We may be unable\nto recruit such personnel on a timely basis, if at all. The loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified\npersonnel, could result in delays in development or approval of our products, loss of sales and diversion of management resources.\n43\nTable of Contents\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary\ninformation and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nWe operate in the highly technical field of research and development of small-molecule drugs and rely, in part, on trade-secret protection in order to\nprotect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that our\ncompetitors will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with\nour employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-\nhow. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by\nthe party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party’s relationship with us. Also, we typically obtain agreements from these parties\nthat inventions conceived by them in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored\nand may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party has illegally obtained, and is using our trade secrets or\nknow-how, is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the U.S. may be less willing to protect\ntrade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade-secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we engage individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or\npharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors or who are employed by academic research institutions. Although no claims\nagainst us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that we, or these employees, have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary\ninformation of their current or former employers, either inadvertently or otherwise. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we\nare successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of our Products\nAcceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve market acceptance will prevent or delay our ability to generate\nrevenues.\nOur future financial performance will depend, at least in part, on the introduction and customer acceptance of our proposed products. Even if approved\nfor marketing by the necessary regulatory authorities, our products may not achieve market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance will depend on\nseveral factors, including:\n● receiving regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing;\n● the timing of market introduction of the product as well as competitive products;\n● the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n● establishing and demonstrating the advantages, safety and efficacy of our technologies;\n● relative convenience and ease of administration, and the convenience of prescribing, administrating and initiating patients on the product and the\nlength of time the patient is on the product;\n● the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n● the willingness of physicians to change their current treatment practices;\n● the willingness of hospitals and hospital systems to include our product candidates as treatment options;\n● demonstration of efficacy and safety in clinical trials;\n● the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n44\nTable of Contents\n● the ability to offer product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n● the price we charge for our product candidates;\n● the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n● impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n● the ability to distinguish safety and efficacy from existing, less expensive generic alternative therapies, if any;\n● the potential and perceived value and advantages of the product over alternative treatments;\n● the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;\n● pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and\nother health plan administrators;\n● attracting corporate partners, including pharmaceutical companies, to assist in commercializing our intended products; and\n● marketing our products.\nPhysicians, patients, payors, or the medical community in general, may be unwilling to accept, use, or recommend any of our products. If we are\nunable to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize and market our proposed products as planned, we may not achieve any market acceptance or\ngenerate revenue. If we are unable to sustain anticipated levels of sales growth from our products, if approved, we may need to reduce our operating\nexpenses, access other sources of cash or otherwise modify our business plans, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nRegulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA, the European Commission, and other regulators, to those specific indications\nand conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated, and we may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are\npromoting the “off-label” use of any of our future product candidates if approved.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to those specific diseases, indications and patient populations for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective\nby the FDA, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency and other regulators. In addition to the\nFDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA\napproval for any desired future indications for our products and product candidates, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced\nand our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in\nclinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications and patient populations that\nare specifically approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the U.S. These “off-label” uses are common across medical\nspecialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. We have implemented compliance and monitoring\npolicies and procedures, including a process for internal review of promotional materials, to deter the promotion for off-label uses. We cannot guarantee\nthat these compliance activities will prevent or timely detect off-label promotion by sales representatives or other personnel in their communications with\nhealth care professionals, patients and others, particularly if these activities are concealed from the Company. Regulatory authorities in the US generally do\nnot regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical\ncompanies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA’s or other competent national authority’s regulations or\nguidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these regulatory authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and\nguidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, suspend or withdraw an approved product\nfrom the market, require a recall or institute fines, which could result in the disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or civil or criminal\nenforcement, and other consequences, any of which could harm our business.\n45\nTable of Contents\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful,\nnon-misleading and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. We engage in medical education activities and communicate with\ninvestigators and potential investigators regarding our clinical trials. If the FDA or other regulatory or enforcement authorities determine that our\ncommunications regarding our marketed product are not in compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and that we have improperly promoted\noff-label uses, or that our communications regarding our investigational products are not in compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and that\nwe have improperly engaged in pre-approval promotion, we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as\ncriminal sanctions.\nAny product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain approval in the future, is subject to, or will be subject to,\nextensive ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA, EMA and other comparable regulatory authorities, and if we fail to comply with\nregulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, we may be subject to penalties, we may be unable to\ngenerate revenue from the sale of such products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to\nfund our operations will be increased.\nAny product for which we have obtain regulatory approval in the future, along with the manufacturing processes and practices, post-approval clinical\nresearch, product labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, are subject to continual requirements of, and review by, the FDA, the\nEMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information\nand reports, registration and listing requirements, current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control,\nquality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians, import and\nexport requirements and recordkeeping. If we or our suppliers encounter manufacturing, quality or compliance difficulties with respect to any of our\nproduct candidates, when and if approved, whether because of the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including as a result of disruptions of\nglobal shipping and the transport of products) or otherwise, we may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or meet commercial demand for\nsuch products, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, the FDA often requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of products. The FDA, the EMA and other\ncomparable international regulatory agencies may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of such post-marketing clinical studies.\nThese post-marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient. Additionally, the FDA may\nrequire a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication\nguide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the\ndrug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry or undergo certain health evaluations or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to ensure the safe\nuse of the drug.\nDiscovery after approval of previously unknown problems with any of our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply\nwith regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n● restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials;\n● restrictions on product manufacturing processes;\n● restrictions on the marketing of a product;\n● restrictions on product distribution;\n● requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n● untitled or warning letters or other adverse publicity;\n● withdrawal of products from the market;\n● refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n46\nTable of Contents\n● recall of products;\n● refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n● product seizure;\n● fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n● refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts;\n● injunctions; or\n● imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIf such regulatory actions are taken, the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if the FDA, the EMA\nor any other comparable international regulatory agency withdraws its approval of a product that is or may be approved, we will be unable to generate\nrevenue from the sale of that product in the relevant jurisdiction, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the capital\nnecessary to fund our operations will be increased. Accordingly, we continue to expend significant time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory\ncompliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance, post-marketing studies and quality control.\nIf any of our third-party contractors fail to perform their responsibilities to comply with FDA rules and regulations, the marketing and sales of our\nproducts could be delayed and we may be subject to enforcement action, which could decrease our revenues.\nConducting our business requires us to manage relationships with third-party contractors. As a result, our success depends partially on the success of\nthese third parties in performing their responsibilities to comply with FDA rules and regulations. Although we pre-qualify our contractors and we believe\nthat they are fully capable of performing their contractual obligations, we cannot directly control the adequacy and timeliness of the resources and expertise\nthat they apply to these activities.\nIf any of our partners or contractors fail to fulfil their obligations in an adequate and timely manner or fail to comply with the FDA’s rules and\nregulations, then the marketing and sales of our products could be delayed. The FDA may also take enforcement actions against us based on compliance\nissues identified with our contractors. If any of these events occur, we may incur significant liabilities, which could decrease our revenues. For example,\nsales and medical science liaison or MSL personnel, including contractors, must comply with FDA requirements for the advertisement and promotion of\nproducts.\nIf manufacturers obtain approval for generic versions of our products, once approved, or of products with which we compete, our business may be\nharmed.\nUnder the FDCA, the FDA can approve an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for a generic version of a branded drug without the ANDA\napplicant undertaking the clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. Generally, in place of such clinical studies, an ANDA\napplicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product has the same active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form and route of\nadministration and that it is bioequivalent to the branded product.\nThe FDCA requires that an applicant for approval of a generic form of a branded drug certify either that its generic product does not infringe any of\nthe patents listed by the owner of the branded drug in the Orange Book or that those patents are not enforceable. This process is known as a paragraph IV\nchallenge. Upon notice of a paragraph IV challenge, a patent owner has 45 days to bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against the\ncompany seeking ANDA approval of a product covered by one of the owner’s patents. If this type of suit is commenced, the FDCA provides a 30-month\nstay on the FDA’s approval of the competitor’s application. If the litigation is resolved in favor of the ANDA applicant or the challenged patent expires\nduring the 30-month stay period, the stay is lifted, and the FDA may thereafter approve the application based on the standards for approval of ANDAs.\nOnce an ANDA is approved by the FDA, the generic manufacturer may market and sell the generic form of the branded drug in competition with the\nbranded medicine.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe ANDA process can result in generic competition if the patents at issue are not upheld or if the generic competitor is found not to infringe the\nowner’s patents. If this were to occur with respect to iopofosine or any future products, once approved, with which our products compete, our business\nwould be harmed.\nUnforeseen safety issues could emerge with our products, once approved, that could require us to change the prescribing information to add\nwarnings, limit use of the product, and/or result in litigation. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our business.\nDiscovery of unforeseen safety problems or increased focus on a known problem with respect to our products, once approved, could impact our ability\nto commercialize our products and could result in restrictions on its permissible uses, including withdrawal of the medicine from the market.\nIf we or others identify additional undesirable side effects caused by our products after approval:\n● regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, contraindications, or field alerts to physicians and\npharmacies;\n● regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product and require us to take our approved drugs off the market;\n● we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials, change the labeling of the product, or\nimplement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS;\n● we may have limitations on how we promote our drugs;\n● third-party payers may limit coverage or reimbursement for our products;\n● sales of our approved products may decrease significantly;\n● we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n● our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our products, once approved and could substantially\nincrease our operating costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from sale of any products for which\nwe obtain approval.\nIf a safety issue emerges post-approval, we may become subject to costly product liability litigation by our customers, their patients or payers. Product\nliability claims could divert management’s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that\nmay not be covered by insurance. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our approved products caused injuries, we will incur\nsubstantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n● decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n● the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop;\n● injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n● withdrawal of patients from clinical studies or cancellation of studies;\n● significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n● substantial monetary awards to patients; and\n● loss of revenue.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe market for our proposed products is rapidly changing and competitive, and new therapeutics, drugs and treatments that may be developed by\nothers could impair our ability to develop our business or become competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our\ntechnologies and proposed products noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market\nfactors. Technological competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the\nfield is intense and expected to increase. Most of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities and budgets than we do, as\nwell as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us.\nAcquisitions of, or investments in, competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase our competitors’ financial,\nmarketing, manufacturing and other resources.\nOur resources are limited, and we may experience management, operational or technical challenges inherent in our activities and novel technologies.\nCompetitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competition. Some of these\ntechnologies may accomplish therapeutic effects similar to those of our technology, but through different means. Our competitors may develop drugs and\ndrug delivery technologies that are more effective than our intended products and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to us.\nThe potential widespread acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our products even if they are\ncommercialized. Many of our targeted diseases and conditions can also be treated by other medication or drug delivery technologies. These treatments may\nbe widely accepted in medical communities and have a longer history of use. The established use of these competitive drugs may limit the potential for\nwidespread acceptance of our technologies and products if commercialized.\nAs a result of continued changes in marketing, sales and distribution, we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to sell our proposed products, develop\na direct sales organization, or enter into relationships with third parties.\nWe have not established marketing, sales or distribution capabilities for our proposed products. Until such time as our proposed products are further\nalong in the development process, we will not devote any meaningful time and resources to this effort. At the appropriate time, we will determine whether\nwe will develop our own sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell our products.\nWe have limited experience in developing, training or managing a sales force. If we choose to establish a direct sales force, we may incur substantial\nadditional expenses in developing, training and managing such an organization. We may be unable to build a sales force on a cost-effective basis or at all.\nIn addition, we will compete with many other companies that currently have extensive marketing and sales operations. Our marketing and sales efforts may\nbe unable to compete against these other companies. We may be unable to establish a sufficient sales and marketing organization on a cost-effective or\ntimely basis, if at all.\nIf we choose to enter into agreements with third parties to sell our proposed products, we may be unable to establish or maintain third-party\nrelationships on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all. In addition, these third parties may have similar or more established relationships with our\ncompetitors.\nWe may be unable to engage qualified distributors. Even if engaged, these distributors may:\n● fail to adequately market our products;\n● fail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to us;\n● offer, design, manufacture or promote competing products; or\n● cease operations with little or no notice.\nIf we fail to develop sales, marketing and distribution channels, we would experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs, which would\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\n49\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to convince physicians of the benefits of our intended products, we may incur delays or additional expense in our attempt to\nestablish market acceptance.\nAchieving use of our products in the target market of cancer diagnosis and treatment may require physicians to be informed regarding these products\nand their intended benefits. The time and cost of such an educational process may be substantial. Inability to successfully carry out this physician education\nprocess may adversely affect market acceptance of our proposed products. We may be unable to educate physicians, in sufficient numbers, in a timely\nmanner regarding our intended proposed products to achieve our marketing plans and product acceptance. Any delay in physician education may materially\ndelay or reduce demand for our proposed products. In addition, we may expend significant funds towards physician education before any acceptance or\ndemand for our proposed products is created, if at all.\nEfforts to educate the physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community on the benefits of our product candidates may\nrequire significant resources and may not be successful. If any of our product candidates are approved, if at all, but do not achieve an adequate level of\nacceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\nIf our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, or if additional healthcare reform measures are adopted, it\ncould hinder or prevent the commercial success of our product candidates.\nThe commercial success of any product for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs\nof our product or product candidates are or will be paid by third-party payors, including government health care programs and private health insurers.\nThere is a significant trend in the health care industry by public and private payers to contain or reduce their costs, including by taking the following steps,\namong others: decreasing the portion of costs payers will cover, ceasing to provide full payment for certain products depending on outcomes or not\ncovering certain products at all. If payers implement any of the foregoing with respect to our products, it would have an adverse impact on our revenue and\nresults of operations. If coverage is not available, or reimbursement is limited, we, or any of our collaborative partners, may not be able to successfully\ncommercialize our product candidates in some jurisdictions. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be at a rate that\ncovers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for\nproducts exists among third-party payors; therefore, coverage and reimbursement levels for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a\nresult, the coverage determination process is often a time consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific, clinical or other support\nfor the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained\nin the first instance.\nIn both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in\nways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the Affordable Care Act which was passed in March 2010 and substantially\nchanged the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, has been subject to judicial, legislative, and regulatory efforts to replace\nit or to alter its interpretation or implementation. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable\nCare Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable\nCare Act have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 included a provision that repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by\nthe Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the\n“individual mandate”. In addition, the Further the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 fully repealed the Affordable Care Act’s mandated “Cadillac”\ntax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S.\nSupreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the\nconstitutionality of the law. It is unclear how future actions before the Supreme Court, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the\nBiden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control\nAct of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with\nrecommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering\nthe legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per\nfiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and, a result of subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect into 2031, unless additional\nCongressional action is\n50\nTable of Contents\ntaken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 with a subsequent\nreduction to 1% implemented from April 1, 2022 until June 30, 2022. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030,\nreductions in Medicare payments will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. In January 2013, President Obama\nsigned into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers,\nincluding hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers\nfrom three to five years.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the\navailability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. If we or any\nthird parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or\nsuch third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained\nand we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nEnacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we\nmay set.\nIn the U.S., there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to\ndrug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs, and reform government program\nreimbursement methodologies for drugs. See Part I, Item 1, Business-Regulation-Reimbursement and Pricing Controls for more information on recent\nhealthcare reform measures that may affect our ability to operate.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of health reform initiatives that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. However,\nwe expect these initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Further, certain broader legislation that is not targeted to the health care industry may\nnonetheless adversely affect our profitability. Any additional healthcare reform measures could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay\nfor healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws and other federal and state\nhealthcare laws, and the failure to comply with such laws could result in substantial penalties. Our employees, independent contractors,\nconsultants, principal investigators, CROs, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including\nnoncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payers and\ncustomers, may expose us to broadly applicable federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations including anti-\nkickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and transparency reporting laws. These laws may constrain the business or financial\narrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute any product for which we\nhave obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare\nitems and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent\nfraud, misconduct, bribery kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive or inappropriate practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide\nrange of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, including promoting off-label uses of our products, commission compensation, certain customer\nincentive programs, certain patient support offerings, and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper\nuse or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or\nclinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. See “Part I,\nItem 1, Business – Regulation – Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the healthcare laws\nand regulations that may affect our ability to operate.\nWe are also exposed to the risk of fraud, misconduct or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, consultants, principal\ninvestigators, CROs, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that fails\nto: comply with the laws of the FDA and other similar foreign regulatory bodies; provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other\nsimilar foreign regulatory bodies; comply with manufacturing standards we have established; comply with federal and state data privacy, security, fraud\nand abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the US and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; or report financial information or data\naccurately or to disclose unauthorized\n51\nTable of Contents\nactivities to us. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate\nconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or\nlawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nWe are also subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. Efforts to ensure that\nour business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and\nenforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting\napplicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending\nourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and\nadministrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a\ncorporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, possible exclusion from participation in\nMedicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment\nor restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Internal Controls\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our ability to meet our reporting requirements.\nWe are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require an annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting and for certain issuers an attestation of this\nassessment by the issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm. The standards to assess that our internal controls over financial reporting are\neffective are evolving and complex, require significant documentation and testing, and may require remediation if they are not met. We expect to incur\nsignificant expenses and to devote resources to Section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis. It is difficult for us to predict how long it will take or costly it\nwill be to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for each year and to remediate any deficiencies in\nour internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to complete the assessment and remediation process on a timely basis. In\naddition, although attestation requirements by our independent registered public accounting firm are not presently applicable to us, we could become\nsubject to these requirements in the future, and we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any resulting changes to internal\ncontrols over financial reporting.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our public disclosures regarding our business, prospects, financial condition, or results\nof operations. In addition, management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be\naddressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and\nconditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management’s assessment of our internal controls over\nfinancial reporting our business and results of operations could be harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations, and there could be a material\nadverse effect on our common stock price. In 2023, three material weaknesses have been identified that are described further in Item 9A. below.\nRisks Related to Our Equity Securities\nFailure to meet Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our common stock, negatively impact the price of our\ncommon stock and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to delisting, it would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers\nwho sell our securities.The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting\ntransactions in our common stock. This would adversely affect the ability of investors to trade our common stock and would adversely affect the value of\nour common stock. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. If we seek to\nimplement a further reverse stock split in order to remain listed on Nasdaq, the announcement or implementation of such a reverse stock split could\nnegatively affect the price of our common stock.\n52\nTable of Contents\nOur stock price has experienced price fluctuations.\nThere can be no assurance that the market price for our common stock will remain at its current level, and a decrease in the market price could result\nin substantial losses for investors. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by one or more of the following factors:\n● announcements or press releases relating to the biopharmaceutical sector or to our own business or prospects;\n● regulatory, legislative or other developments affecting us or the healthcare industry generally;\n● sales by holders of restricted securities pursuant to effective registration statements or exemptions from registration;\n● market conditions specific to biopharmaceutical companies, the healthcare industry and the stock market generally; and\n● our ability to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq exchange.\nOur common stock could be further diluted as the result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or\noptions.\nIn the past, we have issued common stock, convertible securities (such as convertible preferred stock and notes payable) and warrants to raise capital.\nWe have also issued equity as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees and directors. We have shares of common stock\nreserved for issuance upon the exercise of certain of these securities and may increase the shares reserved for these purposes in the future. Our issuance of\nadditional common stock, convertible securities, options and warrants could dilute our common stock, affect the rights of our stockholders, reduce the\nmarket price of our common stock, result in adjustments to exercise prices of outstanding warrants (resulting in these securities becoming exercisable for,\nas the case may be, a greater number of shares of our common stock), or obligate us to issue additional shares of common stock to certain of our\nstockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us or a change in our management more\ndifficult.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control\nthat stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which an investor might otherwise receive a premium for its shares. These provisions\nalso could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock or warrants, thereby depressing the market\nprice of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so.\nFurthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions:\n● provide for the division of the Board into three classes as nearly equal in size as possible with staggered three-year terms and further limit the\nremoval of directors and the filling of vacancies;\n● authorize our Board to issue without stockholder approval blank-check preferred stock that, if issued, could operate as a “poison pill” to dilute the\nstock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our Board;\n● require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n● establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our Board or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder\nmeetings;\n● limit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n53\nTable of Contents\n● require the approval of the holders of 75% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of\nour certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,\nwhich may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from\nmerging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nWe have implemented processes designed to identify, review and manage risks from potential cybersecurity-related data breaches, unauthorized\nintrusions of our information technology systems, and other information security losses on or through our information technology systems that could result\nin adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and electronic information. These processes are managed and monitored\nby our third-party information technology service providers, as supervised by our Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Our CFO has experience in overseeing\nour cybersecurity and information technology programs. We rely heavily on information technology consultants for advice and expertise on monitoring\nevolving industry standards and to monitor our compliance with applicable policies. Our processes include mechanisms, controls, technologies, and\nsystems designed to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data and maintain a stable\ninformation technology environment. With the assistance of our third-party vendors, we conduct regular information technology risk evaluations and\nsecurity audits. Our information technology team conducts due diligence on key technology vendors, contractors and suppliers. We also provide ongoing\neducation communications on cyber and information security, among other topics, and monitor phishing campaigns or other misrepresented system access\nrequests to identify any employees that might need additional training.\nThe Board of Directors, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, has oversight for the most significant risks facing us and for our processes to\nidentify, prioritize, assess, manage, and mitigate those risks. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee receives periodic updates on\ncybersecurity and information technology matters and related risk exposures from our CFO.\nAs of the date of this report, we have not identified any cybersecurity threats or intrusions that have materially affected our strategy, results of\noperations or financial condition. We and our third-party service providers have, however, been the target of cybersecurity threats and we expect these\nthreats to continue. For additional information regarding risks from cybersecurity threats, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this annual report on\nForm 10-K.\nItem 2.

[Reserved]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of\ncancer. Our core objective is to leverage our proprietary PDC delivery platform to develop PDCs that are designed to specifically target cancer cells and\ndeliver improved efficacy and better safety as a result of fewer off-target effects. Our PDC platform possesses the potential for the discovery and\ndevelopment of the next generation of cancer-targeting treatments, and we plan to develop PDCs both independently and through research and\ndevelopment collaborations.\nOur lead PDC therapeutic, iopofosine, is a small-molecule PDC designed to provide targeted delivery of iodine-131 directly to cancer cells, while\nlimiting exposure to healthy cells. We believe this profile differentiates iopofosine from many traditional on-market treatments. Iopofosine is currently\nbeing evaluated in the multi cohort CLOVER-1 Phase 2 study in adult B-cell malignancies and the CLOVER-2 Phase 1 study for a variety of pediatric\ncancers. Our product pipeline also includes one preclinical PDC chemotherapeutic program (CLR 1900) and several partnered PDC assets. The CLR 1900\nSeries targets for solid tumors with a payload that inhibits mitosis (cell division), a validated pathway for treating cancers.\nResults of Operations\nResearch and development expense. Research and development expense consists of costs incurred in identifying, developing, testing, and manufacturing\nproduct candidates, which primarily include the cost of manufacturing materials, fees paid to contract research organizations, fees paid to medical\ninstitutions for clinical studies, and costs to secure intellectual property. We analyze our research and development expenses based on four categories as\nfollows: clinical projects, manufacturing and related, preclinical projects, and general fixed and overhead costs that are not allocated to the functional\nproject costs, including personnel costs, facility costs, related overhead costs, and patent costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive,\nfinance, and administrative functions. Other costs include insurance, costs for public company activities, investor relations, directors’ fees, and professional\nfees for legal and accounting services.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $28,211,000, compared to\napproximately $19,220,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following table provides a summary of research and development costs by category for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 Variance\nClinical project costs $ 15,132,000 $ 12,964,000 $ 2,168,000\nManufacturing and related costs 9,341,000 4,238,000 5,103,000\nPre-clinical project costs 483,000 431,000 52,000\nGeneral research and development costs 3,255,000 1,587,000 1,668,000\n$ 28,211,000 $ 19,220,000 $ 8,991,000\nThe overall increase in research and development expense of approximately $8,991,000, or 47%, was primarily a result of an increase in\nmanufacturing and related costs related to greater production sourcing necessary to support clinical trials and establish commercial production capabilities\nof approximately $5,103,000 and clinical project costs of approximately $2,168,000, driven by the timing of the activities related to our pivotal and\npediatric trials and an increase in general research and development costs of approximately $1,668,000 primarily attributable to an increase in personnel-\nrelated costs.\n56\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $10,749,000, compared to\napproximately $9,594,000 in 2022. The increase of $1,155,000, or 12% in general and administrative costs was primarily driven by an increase in\npersonnel costs partially offset by a reduction in professional fees.\nOther income (expense), net. Interest income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $387,000, as compared to approximately\n$153,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is a result of increased returns on money market cash equivalents. Other income was\napproximately $530,000 was the result of a gain from the valuation of the outstanding warrants issued in September 2023, partially offset by warrant\nissuance costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear ended December 31, 2023, Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.6 million, compared to $19.9 million as of December 31, 2022, a decrease of $10.3\nmillion. This decrease was primarily a result of research and development expense and general and administrative expenses. The cash used in operating\nactivities during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $32,377,000. Net cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock,\npreferred stock, warrants during 2023 was approximately $22,939,000.\nOur cash requirements have historically been for our research and development activities, finance and administrative costs, capital expenditures and\noverall working capital. We have experienced negative operating cash flows since inception and have funded our operations primarily from sales of\ncommon stock and other securities. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $217,483,000.\nLiquidity Outlook\nWe have incurred losses since inception in devoting substantially all of our efforts toward research and development. During the year ended December\n31, 2023, we generated a net loss of approximately $38.0 million and used approximately $32.4 million in cash for operations. We expect that we will\ncontinue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated cash balance was approximately $9.6 million.\nWe believe our cash balance as of December 31, 2023, when combined with funds generated by the exercise of warrants in January 2024 (see Note 13 to\nour audited financial statements in Item 8 below), is adequate to fund our basic budgeted operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. Our ability to execute\nour operating plan beyond that time depends on our ability to obtain additional funding via the sale of equity and/or debt securities, a strategic transaction\nor otherwise. We plan to actively pursue all available financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will obtain the necessary funding.\nOther than the uncertainties regarding our ability to obtain additional funding and our ability to meet the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, there are\ncurrently no known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP,\nrequires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the\nfinancial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Management bases its estimates and\njudgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nActual results could differ from those estimates. We review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period\nthat they are determined to be necessary.\nWe believe that the following accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial\nstatements.\nAccrued Liabilities. As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued liabilities. This process involves\nidentifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service\nas of each balance sheet date in our financial statements. Examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include: contract service fees, such as\namounts paid to clinical research organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical studies; fees paid to vendors in conjunction with the\nmanufacturing of clinical materials; and professional\n57\nTable of Contents\nservice fees, such as for lawyers and accountants. In connection with such service fees, our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status\nand timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers. The majority of our service providers invoice us\nmonthly in arrears for services performed. In the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred, or we over or underestimate the\nlevel of services performed or the costs of such services, our reported expenses for such period would be too high or too low. The date on which certain\nservices commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective\njudgments. We make these judgments based on the facts and circumstances known to us, in accordance with GAAP.\nFair value measurements. We account for certain financial assets at fair value, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (i.e., exit price) in the principal, most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\non the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that a market participant would use\nin pricing an asset or liability. In conjunction with our financing in September 2023, we allocated the preferred stock and warrants separately based on the\nrespective estimated relative fair value. If management made different assumptions or judgments, material differences in measurements of fair value could\noccur.\nWarrants. We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms\nand applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC\n815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability\npursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are\nindexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of\nour control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of\nwarrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. If these instruments are initially classified as\nliabilities and subsequently meet the requirements for equity classification, we reclassify the fair value to equity.\nPreferred Stock. We accounts for preferred stock based upon their specific terms and the authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815, including\nwhether they are freestanding instruments, whether any redemption or conversion aspects exist and how they are required to be settled (particularly if there\nis a cash settlement aspect), whether they contain characteristics that are predominantly debt-like or equity-like, whether they have embedded derivatives,\nand if they have redemption features. Based upon analysis of these criteria, the preferred stock will be classified as either debt, temporary (or “mezzanine”)\nequity, or permanent equity. The resultant classification is then evaluated quarterly to determine whether any change to the classification is required.\nItem 7A.

Financial Statements.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR CELLECTAR BIOSCIENCES, INC.\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Baker Tilly US, LLP, Madison, Wisconsin, PCAOB ID No. 23) 60\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 62\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 63\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 64\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 65\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 66\n59\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nCellectar Biosciences, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cellectar Biosciences, Inc. and Subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes\n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years\nthen ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1\nof the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recurring losses from operations, an accumulated deficit, expects to incur losses for the\nforeseeable future and requires additional working capital. These are the reasons that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not contain any\nadjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain\nan understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Preferred Stock and Warrants in connection with the September 2023 Private Placement\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n60\nTable of Contents\nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company issued shares of Series E-1 preferred stock, along with Tranche A warrants\nand Tranche B warrants to purchase Series E-3 and E-4 preferred stock, respectively. The Series E-1 was classified as mezzanine equity at its issuance date,\nupon requisite shareholder approval this was determined to be classified as permanent equity in the fourth quarter of 2023, and the warrants issued by the\nCompany are classified as liabilities and are recorded at fair value at each reporting period.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the accounting for these instruments constituted a critical audit matter included the significant\ncomplexity of the relevant accounting guidance as well as the extent of management judgments and certain assumptions involved in the application of that\nguidance. In addition, gathering certain audit evidence of the Company’s valuation of the warrant liability was especially challenging as the fair value is\nbased on the selection of fair value methodologies as well as various inputs, significant assumptions and estimation uncertainty used in that fair value\ndetermination. Lastly, the audit effort included the use of firm personnel with relevant expertise to assist in auditing this transaction and the related\nvaluation.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n● Assessing the design and implementation of management’s controls over the accounting for these instruments, which included controls over the\nproper selection of fair value methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair value of warrant liability.\n● Reading the agreements and comparing the relevant terms to management’s analysis of the transactions.\n● Utilizing the assistance of firm personnel having expertise in the accounting for these instruments, we evaluated management’s conclusions\nregarding the balance sheet classification and fair value determination of the two separate freestanding instruments included in the capital raise,\nthe Series E preferred stock and the Tranche A and Tranche B warrants.\n● Involving firm valuation specialists in evaluating the Company’s determination of fair value, including the appropriateness of the fair value\nmethodologies.\n● Testing the Company’s determination of fair value for the transaction, as well as the respective relative fair value allocations.

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION\nCellectar Biosciences, Inc. (Cellectar or the Company) is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and\ncommercialization of drugs for the treatment of cancer, leveraging our proprietary phospholipid drug conjugate™ (PDC™) delivery platform that\nspecifically targets cancer cells and delivers improved efficacy and better safety as a result of fewer off-target effects.\nThe Company has incurred losses since inception in devoting substantially all of its efforts toward research and development and has an accumulated\ndeficit of approximately $217,483,000 as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company generated a net loss of\napproximately $37,983,000 and the Company expects that it will continue to generate operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company believes\nthat its cash balance as of December 31, 2023, when combined with funds generated by the exercise of warrants in January 2024 (see Note 13), is adequate\nto fund its basic budgeted operations into the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe Company’s ability to execute its current operating plan depends on its ability to obtain additional funding via the sale of equity and/or debt\nsecurities, a strategic transaction or other source of capital. The Company plans to continue actively pursuing financing alternatives, however, there can be\nno assurance that it will obtain the necessary funding, raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year\nof the date these financial statements are issued. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome\nof this uncertainty.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain accounting policies, as described in this note and elsewhere in\nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All inter-\ncompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management\nto make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates including those related to potential accrued liabilities, valuation of warrant and equity-based\ninstruments, and share-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to\nbe reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from\nthose estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nCash and Cash Equivalents — All short-term investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.\nFixed Assets — Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property and equipment is provided using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets (3 to 10 years). Leasehold improvements are depreciated over 64 months (their estimated useful life), which represented\nthe full term of the lease at the time the leasehold improvements were capitalized. Our only long-lived assets are property, equipment and Right-of-Use\n(ROU) assets. The Company periodically, and at a minimum annually, evaluates long-lived assets for potential impairment. Recoverability of assets to be\nheld and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the\nasset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying\namount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Such analyses necessarily involve judgement. The Company did not experience any events or\nchanges in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable as of December 31, 2023. There were no fixed asset\nimpairment charges recorded during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nRight-of-Use Asset and Lease Liability — The Company accounts for all material leases in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification\n(ASC) Topic 842, Leases. ROU assets are amortized over their estimated useful life, which represents the full term of the lease. See Note 11.\n66\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation — The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards.\nThe resulting compensation expense, net of expected forfeitures, for awards that are not performance-based, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nservice period of the award, which for 2023 and 2022 ranged from twelve months to three years.\nResearch and Development — Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes revenue and cost reimbursements\nfrom government grants when it is probable that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to the grant arrangement and the grant proceeds\nwill be received. Government grants are recognized on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognizes the related costs for which the\ngovernment grant is intended to compensate. Specifically, when government grants are related to reimbursements for cost of revenues or operating\nexpenses, the government grants are recognized as a reduction of the related expense.\nIncome Taxes — Income taxes are accounted for using the liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on temporary differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit\ncarryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities\nof a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when it is more-likely-\nthan-not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management has provided a full valuation allowance against the Company’s net\ndeferred tax asset. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing tax returns are required to be evaluated to determine whether the\ntax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold\nwould be recorded as tax expense in the current year. There were no uncertain tax positions that require accrual to or disclosure in the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments — The guidance under FASB ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of certain\nfinancial instruments. Financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements consist of cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other\nassets, accounts payable, warrant liabilities and long-term obligations. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, other current assets and\naccounts payable approximate their fair value as a result of their short-term nature. See Note 11 regarding long-term obligations.\nWarrants — The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s\nspecific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and\nHedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a\nliability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the\nwarrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a\ncircumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional\njudgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. Valuation\nchanges, as well as the cost to issue the warrants, are included in Other (Expense) Income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. If\nthese instruments are initially classified as liabilities and subsequently meet the requirements for equity classification, the Company reclassifies the fair\nvalue to equity.\nPreferred Stock — The Company accounts for preferred stock based upon their specific terms and the authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815,\nincluding whether they are freestanding instruments, whether any redemption or conversion aspects exist and how they are required to be settled\n(particularly if there is a cash settlement aspect), whether they contain characteristics that are predominantly debt-like or equity-like, whether they have\nembedded derivatives, and if they have redemption features. Based upon analysis of these criteria, the preferred stock will be classified as either debt,\ntemporary (or “mezzanine”) equity, or permanent equity. The resultant classification is then evaluated quarterly to determine whether any change to the\nclassification is required.\nConcentration of Credit Risk — Financial instruments that subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents on deposit with\nfinancial institutions. The Company’s excess cash as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 is on deposit in interest-bearing accounts with well-established\nfinancial institutions. At times, such amounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance limits. As of December 31, 2023,\nuninsured cash balances totaled approximately $9,123,000.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements — For the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2022, management adopted ASU 2021-10, Government\nAssistance (Topic 832), which aims to provide increased transparency by requiring business entities to disclose\n67\nTable of Contents\ninformation about certain type of government assistance they receive in the notes to the financial statements. Reimbursements of eligible expenditures\npursuant to government assistance programs are recorded as reductions of operating costs when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will\ncomply with the conditions attached to the grant arrangement and when the reimbursement has been claimed. The determination of the amount of the\nclaim, and accordingly the receivable amount, requires management to make calculations based on its interpretation of eligible expenditures in accordance\nwith the terms of the programs. The reimbursement claims submitted by the Company are subject to review by the relevant government agencies. The\nCompany currently has a cancer treatment research award through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) totaling approximately $2.0 million over a period of\napproximately three years. In September 2022, the Company was awarded $1.98 million in additional grant funding to expand our ongoing Phase 1 study\nof iopofosine I 131 in children and adolescents with inoperable relapsed or refractory high-grade gliomas (HGGs). The grant was awarded by the NCI\nbased upon the initial signals of efficacy in the Phase 1 study, which is an international, open-label, dose escalation, safety study. The funding allows for an\nexpansion from Part 1a into the Part 1b portion of our ongoing Phase 1 pediatric study.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the Company received approximately $1,759,000 in NCI grant funding under the grants described\nabove, all of which was reported as a reduction of research and development (R&D) expenses. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany received approximately $697,000 in NCI grant funding under the grants described above, all of which was reported as a reduction of research\nand development (R&D) expenses.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which is\nintended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. Public business entities are required to adopt this standard for\nannual fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this\nguidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nThe Company evaluates all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the FASB for consideration of their applicability to our consolidated financial\nstatements. We have assessed all ASUs issued but not yet adopted and concluded that those not disclosed are not relevant to the Company or are not\nexpected to have a material impact.\n3. FAIR VALUE\nIn accordance with Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic of the FASB ASC 820, the Company groups its financial assets and financial\nliabilities generally measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded, and the reliability of the\nassumptions used to determine fair value.\n● Level 1: Input prices quoted in an active market for identical financial assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2: Inputs other than prices quoted in Level 1, such as prices quoted for similar financial assets and liabilities in active markets, prices for\nidentical assets, and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n● Level 3: Input prices quoted that are significant to the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities which are not observable or supported by an\nactive market.\nTo the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value\nrequires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in\nLevel 3. A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. The carrying amounts\nreported for other current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature.\nIn September 2023 the Company issued warrants to purchase shares of preferred stock which, on an as-converted basis, represent an aggregate of\n21,025,641 shares of common stock (the September 2023 Warrants) (see Note 6). The fair value of the September 2023 Warrants was determined using a\nprobability-weighted expected return method (PWERM) with a scenario-based Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes model. The PWERM is a\nscenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of the Company’s different classes of equity based upon an analysis of future values for the\nCompany, assuming various outcomes. Under both models, assumptions and estimates are used to value the preferred stock warrants. The Company\nassesses these assumptions and estimates on a quarterly basis as additional information that impacts the assumptions is obtained. The quantitative elements\nassociated with the inputs\n68\nTable of Contents\nimpacting the fair value measurement of the September 2023 Warrants include the value per share of the underlying common stock, the timing, form and\noverall value of the expected exits for the stockholders, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield and the expected volatility of the Company’s\nshares. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve for time periods approximately equal to the remaining\ncontractual term of the warrants. The Company estimated a 0% dividend yield based on the expected dividend yield and the fact that the Company has\nnever paid or declared cash dividends. Expected volatility was determined based upon the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. These\nwarrants are classified within the Level 3 hierarchy because of the nature of these inputs and the valuation technique utilized. The Warrant Liability of\n$3,700,000 presented on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, consists entirely of the estimated value of the September 2023\nWarrants.\nThe following table summarizes the modified option-pricing assumptions used on September 8, 2023, which was the date of issuance, and December\n31, 2023:\nSeptember 8 December 31\nVolatility 83.0-84.0% 82.0-83.0%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.39-5.53% 3.80-5.40%\nExpected life (years) 0.4-5.0 0.3-4.7\nDividend 0% 0%\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the fair market value of the warrants which are classified within the Level 3 fair value hierarchy from\nSeptember 8, 2023, which was the date of issuance, through December 31, 2023:\nLevel 3\nBeginning fair value of warrants $ 4,700,000\nGain from change in fair value (1,000,000)\nDecember 31, 2023 fair value of warrants $ 3,700,000\n4.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nSeptember 2023 Private Placement\nOn September 8, 2023, in a private placement with certain institutional investors, the Company issued 1,225 shares of Series E-1 preferred stock,\nalong with Tranche A warrants to purchase 2,205 shares of Series E-3 preferred stock and Tranche B warrants to purchase 1,715 shares of Series E-4\npreferred stock. Shares of Series E preferred stock were issued at a fixed price of $20,000 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $24.5 million and net\nproceeds of approximately $22.2 million after placement agent fees and other customary expenses. The conversion prices for the preferred stock are as\nfollows: for the Series E-1 or E-2 preferred stock, $1.82 per share of common stock, or a total of 13,461,538 shares of common stock; for the Series E-3\npreferred stock, $3.185 per share of common stock, or a total of 13,846,154 shares of common stock; and for the Series E-4 preferred stock, $4.7775 per\nshare of common stock, or a total of 7,179,487 shares of common stock, in each case subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend,\nstock split, combination or other similar recapitalization. The warrants are exercisable as follows:\n● Tranche A warrants, for an aggregate exercise price of $44.1 million, exercisable for Series E-3 preferred stock until the earlier of September 6,\n2026, or 10 trading days after the Company's announcement of positive topline data from the Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia CLOVER WaM\npivotal trial; and,\n● Tranche B warrants, for an aggregate exercise price of $34.3 million, exercisable for Series E-4 preferred stock until the earlier of September 6,\n2028, or 10 days following the Company’s public announcement of its receipt of written approval from the FDA of its New Drug Application for\niopofosine I 131.\nThe Tranche A and Tranche B warrants do not qualify as derivatives; however, they do not meet the requirements necessary to be considered indexable\nin the Company’s stock. As a result, and in accordance with the guidance in FASB ASC 815, the warrants continue to be deemed liabilities. All such\nliabilities are required to be presented at fair value, with changes reflected in financial results for the period.\nWhen issued, the Series E-1 preferred stock had a redemption feature; therefore, it was classified as mezzanine equity as of September 30, 2023. The\nSeries E-1 preferred stock also had a liquidation preference, which was calculated as an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) two times (2X) the\nOriginal Per Share Price, together with any declared, unpaid dividends, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series\nE-1 preferred stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation. While the Series E-1 preferred was outstanding, this\nresulted in both the Tranche A and Tranche B warrants being considered puttable by virtue of the liquidation preference impacting the disposition of these\nwarrants in the event of a liquidation. In accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification section 480, a puttable warrant is deemed to\nbe a liability. These features only applied to the Series E-1 preferred stock when it was outstanding; upon stockholder approval of the transaction, which\nwas obtained by the Company at a special meeting of stockholders held on October 25, 2023, the Series E-1 preferred stock immediately converted into\neither Series E-2 preferred stock and/or common stock, dependent upon the beneficial ownership position of the holder.\nThe net proceeds from the September 2023 Private Placement were allocated first to the fair value of the Tranche A and Tranche B warrants, which\nhad a fair value upon issuance of $4,700,000, with the remainder, or $17,920,000, allocated to the Series E-1 preferred stock. Upon stockholder approval of\nthe transaction, the entire amount that had been assigned to mezzanine equity was\n70\nTable of Contents\nreclassified to Series E-2 preferred stock and is a component of permanent equity, as is reflected in the financial statements. As a result of the stockholder\napproval, Series E-1 preferred stock was fully extinguished in accordance with the terms of the financing.\nSeries E-2 preferred stock is convertible to common stock at the request of the holder, subject to the holder not exceeding certain beneficial ownership\npercentages as stipulated in the financing agreement. Subsequent to the issuance of the Series E-2 preferred stock and prior to December 31, 2023,\npreferred holders converted 905.24 shares of preferred stock into 9,947,684 shares of common stock at the stated rate of $1.82 per common share.\nOctober 2022 Public Offering and Private Placement\nOn October 25, 2022, the Company completed a registered direct offering of 3,275,153 shares of the Company’s common stock at $2.085 per share\nand warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,275,153 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement priced at-the-market under Nasdaq\nrules. In a separate concurrent private placement transaction, the Company offered and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,875,945\nshares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,875,945 shares of common stock. The warrants are immediately exercisable at an\nexercise price of $1.96 per share and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the closing date. Each pre-funded warrant had a purchase price of $2.08499, is\nimmediately exercisable at an exercise price of $0.00001 per share and will not expire until exercised in full. The registered direct offering and private\nplacements resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $10.7 million with net proceeds to the Company of approximately $9.6 million after\ndeducting estimated offering expenses. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 355,235 pre-funded warrants were converted into 355,235\nshares of common stock. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 177,877 common warrants were exercised for proceeds of $348,638. There\nwere no common warrants exercised during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\nIn accordance with the concept of FASB ASC 820 regarding the October 2022 public offering, the Company allocated the value of the proceeds to the\ncommon stock, common warrants, and pre-funded warrants utilizing a relative fair value basis. Using the closing trading price for our stock on October 20,\n2022, the Company computed the fair value of the shares sold. This valuation did not impact the total gross increase to Stockholders’ Equity of $10.7\nmillion, but is an internal, proportionate calculation allocating gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million to common stock, $4.4 million to common\nwarrants and $2.3 million to pre-funded warrants.\n2022 Reverse Stock Split\nAt the annual stockholders’ meeting held on June 24, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s certificate of\nincorporation to effect a reverse split of the Company’s common stock at a ratio between 1-for-5 to 1-for-10 in order to satisfy requirements for continued\nlisting of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq. The board of directors authorized the 1-for-10 ratio of the reverse split on June 27, 2022, and effective\nat the close of business on July 21, 2022, the Company’s certificate of incorporation was amended to effect a 1-for-10 reverse split of the Company’s\ncommon stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements give\nretroactive effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented.\nAuthorized Share Increase\nAt a special meeting of stockholders held on October 25, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment of the Company’s Second\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the authorized common stock from 160,000,000 shares to 170,000,000 shares.\n71\nTable of Contents\nCommon Stock Warrants\nThe following table summarizes the outstanding warrants to purchase common stock as of December 31, 2023:\nNumber of\nShares Issuable\nUpon\nExercise of\nOutstanding Exercise\nOffering Warrants Price Expiration Date\n2023 Tranche A Preferred Warrants 13,846,154 $ 3.185 September 8, 2026(1)\n2023 Tranche B Preferred Warrants 7,179,487 $ 4.7775 September 8, 2028(1)\n2022 Common Warrants 4,748,221 $ 1.96 October 25, 2027\n2022 Pre-Funded Warrants 1,079,136 $ 0.00001 N/A\nJune 2020 Series H Warrants 720,796 $ 12.075 June 5, 2025\nMay 2019 Series F Warrants 195,700 $ 24.00 May 20, 2024\nMay 2019 Series G Warrants 201,800 $ 24.00 May 20, 2024\nOctober 2017 Series D Warrants 31,085 $ 178.00 October 14, 2024\nTotal 28,002,379\n(1) These warrants are described further under the caption “September 2023 Private Placement” above.\n7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\n2021 Stock Incentive Plan\nThe Company maintains the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”). The Company utilizes stock-based compensation incentives as a component\nof its employee and non-employee director and officer compensation philosophy. A committee of the Board of Directors determines the terms of the\nawards granted and may grant various forms of equity-based incentive compensation. Currently, these incentives consist principally of stock options and\nrestricted shares. All outstanding awards under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) remained in effect according to the terms of the 2015 Plan.\nAny shares that are currently available under the 2015 Plan and any shares underlying 2015 Plan awards which are forfeited, cancelled, reacquired by the\nCompany or otherwise terminated are added to the shares available for grant under the 2021 Plan.\nUnder the current stock option award program, all options become exercisable between one and three years after issuance and expire after ten years.\nThe fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Volatility is based on the\nCompany’s historical common stock volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time. The expected term\nof stock options granted is based on an estimate of when options will be exercised in the future. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur. No dividends have\nbeen recorded historically.\nAt the annual meeting of stockholders held on June 23, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common\nstock available for issuance under our 2021 Stock Incentive Plan by 1,100,000 to 2,368,000.\n72\nTable of Contents\nDuring the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, stock options granted were 1,617,000 and 440,250, respectively. The following table\nsummarizes amounts charged to expense for stock-based compensation related to employee and director stock option grants:\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nEmployee and director stock option and stock grants:\nResearch and development $ 505,155 $ 165,461\nGeneral and administrative 1,905,133 1,287,502\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 2,410,288 $ 1,452,964\nIn January 2023, the Company granted 609,000 non-statutory stock option awards at an exercise price of $1.68 per share to employees. These grants\nwere contingent upon the approval of the increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan that was approved by the\nstockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 23, 2023. In accordance with the removal of the contingency, the Company began\nrecognizing the expense for these awards beginning in June 2023.\nIn December 2023, the Company granted 2,776,000 contingent, non-statutory stock option awards at an exercise price of $2.65 per share to our\nemployees and our directors. Each of these grants is contingent on approval of an increase in the shares available in the 2021 Stock Incentive Plan that is to\nbe voted on by the stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders expected to be held in June 2024. Until such time that the contingent non-statutory\nstock option awards are approved by stockholders, no expense will be recognized by the Company.\nIn December 2023, the Company awarded $434,132 in cash and 213,532 shares of stock, valued at $565,868, to certain employees as a result of the\nattainment of milestones established and approved by a committee of the Board of Directors. Due to the contingent nature of those awards, which were\nfully vested upon milestone attainment, the expense was recognized by the Company upon grant.\nAssumptions Used in Determining Fair Value\nValuation and amortization method. The fair value of each stock award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nThe estimated fair value of employee stock options is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the required service period which is\ngenerally the vesting period. The estimated fair value of the non-employee options is amortized to expense over the period during which a non-employee is\nrequired to provide services for the award (usually the vesting period).\nVolatility. The Company estimates volatility based on the Company’s historical volatility since its common stock has been publicly traded.\nRisk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the\nexpected term assumption.\nExpected term. The expected term of stock options granted is based on an estimate of when options will be exercised in the future. The Company\napplied the simplified method of estimating the expected term of the options, as described in the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletins 107 and 110, as the\nhistorical experience is not indicative of the expected behavior in the future. The expected term, calculated under the simplified method, is applied to\ngroups of stock options that have similar contractual terms. Using this method, the expected term is determined using the average of the vesting period and\nthe contractual life of the stock options granted. The Company applied the simplified method to non-employees who have a truncation of term based on\ntermination of service and utilizes the contractual life of the stock options granted for those non-employee grants which do not have a truncation of service.\nForfeitures. The Company only records stock-based compensation expense for those awards that are expected to vest. The Company accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur.\nDividends. The Company has not historically issued dividends.\n73\nTable of Contents\nSummary. The following table summarizes the assumptions used for stock options granted to employees and directors in the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nVolatility 82.02-83.28% 82.47-100%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.59-4.68% 1.65-3.96%\nExpected life (years) 6 6\nDividend 0% 0%\nExercise prices for all grants made during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were equal to the market value of the Company’s\ncommon stock on the date of grant.\nStock Option Activity\nA summary of stock option activity is as follows:\nNumber of\nShares\nIssuable Weighted\nUpon Average\nExercise Weighted Remaining\nof Average Contracted Aggregate\nOutstanding Exercise Term in Intrinsic\nOptions Price Years Value\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021 423,820 $ 22.70\nGranted 440,250 $ 4.51\nExpired (6) $ 15,000.00\nForfeited (117,807) $ 12.02\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 746,257 $ 13.48 8.58 $ —\nGranted 1,617,000 $ 1.78\nExpired (8) $ 8,325\nForfeited (11,346) $ 1.92\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 2,351,903 $ 5.46 8.64 $ 1,682,667\nExercisable as of December 31, 2023 514,171 $ 15.68 $ 30,817\nUnvested as of December 31, 2023 1,837,732 $ 2.58 $ 1,652,350\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding is calculated based on the positive difference between the estimated per-share fair value of\ncommon stock at the end of the respective period and the exercise price of the underlying options. Shares of common stock issued upon the exercise of\noptions are from authorized but unissued shares. At December 31, 2023, we had 116,579 shares available for grant under the 2021 Option Plan.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.35 and $3.49, respectively.\nThe total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1,647,355 and $712,431, respectively. The weighted-\naverage grant-date fair value of vested and unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2023 was $11.13 and $1.81, respectively. The weighted-average\ngrant-date fair value of vested and unvested options outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $19.92 and $5.25, respectively.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of options forfeited during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.41 and $7.33, respectively.\nThe number of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was 308,144 and 135,986, respectively. The number of\noptions unvested at January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2022 was 540,223 and 343,996, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of options\nunvested at January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2022 was $5.25 and $3.20, respectively.\n74\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $2,205,192 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation\narrangements. Of this total amount, the Company expects to recognize approximately $1,330,233, $775,193, and $99,766 during 2024, 2025 and 2026,\nrespectively. The Company’s expense estimates are based upon the expectation that all unvested options will vest in the future.\n8.

Federal NOLs generated as of December 31, 2017, will expire\nin 2023 through 2037, while NOLs generated during 2018 and later will be carried forward indefinitely until utilized. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $97,080,000. State NOL carryforwards will expire in 2029 through 2043.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal research and development (R&D) and orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately\n$15,869,000 which will expire in 2024 through 2042. As of December 31, 2023, the Company also had state credit carryforwards of approximately\n$1,045,000 which will expire in 2025 through 2038.\nThe Company had federal NOLs and R&D credit carryforwards of $502,000 and $13,000, respectively, that expired in 2023.\nThe NOL, R&D and orphan drug credit carryforwards may have, or may become subject to, an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative\nchanges in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state tax provisions. This could limit the amount of NOLs that the Company can utilize\nannually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation, if any, will be determined based on the value of the\nCompany immediately prior to an ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. If and when the\nCompany utilizes the NOL carryforwards in a future period, it will perform an analysis to determine the effect, if any, of these loss limitation rules on the\nNOL carryforward balances.\nThe Company has evaluated the available evidence supporting the realization of its deferred tax assets, including the amount and timing of future\ntaxable income, and has determined that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result of uncertainties\nsurrounding the realization of the deferred tax assets, the Company maintains a full valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets. When the\nCompany determines that it will be able to realize some portion or all of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance on its deferred tax\nassets would have the effect of increasing net income in the period such determination is made.\nThe Company did not have unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties at any time during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022,\nand does not anticipate having unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. The Company is subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service\nand state taxing authorities for tax periods commencing January 1, 2018, as a result of its NOLs. However, any adjustment related to these periods would\nbe limited to the amount of the NOL generated in the year(s) under examination.\n9. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common\nstock and pre-funded warrants outstanding during the period. The pre-funded warrants are considered common shares outstanding for the purposes of the\nbasic net loss per share calculation because of the nominal cash consideration and lack of other contingencies for issuance of the underlying common\nshares. Diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted,\nby the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the dilutive potential common stock equivalents then outstanding. Potential\ncommon stock equivalents consist of stock options, warrants, and convertible preferred shares. Since there is a net loss attributable to common\nstockholders for the years\n76\nTable of Contents\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the inclusion of common stock equivalents in the computation for those periods would be antidilutive. Accordingly,\nbasic and diluted net loss per share is the same for all periods presented.\nThe following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share since their inclusion would have\nbeen antidilutive:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nWarrants 28,002,379 6,714,479\nStock options 2,351,903 746,257\nConvertible preferred shares 3,624,957 111,111\nTotal potentially dilutive shares 33,979,239 7,571,847\n10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal\nThe Company may be involved in legal matters and disputes in the ordinary course of business. We do not anticipate that the outcome of such matters\nand disputes will materially affect the Company’s financial statements.\n11. LEASES\nOperating Lease Liability\nIn June 2018, the Company executed an agreement for office space in the Borough of Florham Park, Morris County, New Jersey to be used as its\nheadquarters (HQ Lease). The HQ Lease commenced upon completion of certain improvements in October 2018 and terminates in February 2024 with an\noption to extend the term of the lease for one additional 60-month period.\nOn December 30, 2022, the Company entered into an Amended Agreement of Lease, with CAMPUS 100 LLC (the “Landlord”). Under the Amended\nLease, which was accounted for as a modification of the initial lease, as the Company will continue to lease 3,983 square feet of rentable area on the\nsecond floor of a building located at 100 Campus Drive in Florham Park, New Jersey, for the period commencing on March 1, 2023 and ending on April\n30, 2029. The Company also has an option to extend the term of the Amended Lease for one additional 60-month period.\nUnder the terms of the Amended Lease, the Company’s previously paid security deposit of $75,000 was reduced to $23,566 and the aggregate rent due\nover the term of the Amended Lease is approximately $918,000, which will be reduced to approximately $893,000 after certain rent abatements. The\nCompany will also be required to pay its proportionate share of certain operating expenses and real estate taxes applicable to the leased premises. After\ncertain rent abatements the rent is approximately $11,800 per month for the first year and then escalates thereafter by 2% per year for the duration of the\nterm. The Company has not entered into any leases with related parties.\nDiscount Rate\nThe Company has determined an appropriate interest rate to be used in evaluating the present value of the Amended Lease liability considering factors\nsuch as the Company’s credit rating, borrowing terms offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, amount of lease payments, quality of collateral\nand alignment of the borrowing term and lease term. The Company considers 14% per annum as reasonable to use as the incremental borrowing rate for\nthe purpose of calculating the liability under the Amended Lease. In conjunction with the June 2018 lease, the Company had previously used a 10% per\nannum incremental borrowing rate.\n77\nTable of Contents\nMaturity Analysis of Short-Term and Operating Leases\nThe following table approximates the dollar maturity of the Company’s undiscounted payments for its short-term leases and operating lease liabilities\nas of December 31, 2023:\nYears ending December 31,\n2024 $ 132,000\n2025 146,000\n2026 150,000\n2027 153,000\n2028 155,000\nThereafter 53,000\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 789,000\nLess: Imputed interest (236,000)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 553,000\n12. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLAN\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that allows eligible employees to contribute a\nportion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company has not made any matching contributions under this plan.\n13. SUBSEQUENT EVENT\nIn January 2024, the Company released topline data from its pivotal, Phase 2b CLOVER WaM trial. In accordance with the terms of the September\n2023 financing, the Tranche A warrant expiration accelerated to 10 trading days after the topline data release. Warrant holders exercised the Tranche A\nwarrants in their entirety, resulting in the Company issuing 2,205 shares of Series E-3 preferred stock, which are convertible to common stock at the stated\nrate of $3.185 per share, and receiving gross proceeds of $44.1 million and net proceeds of $42.8 million.\nAdditionally, during January and February 2024, 547,177 warrants issued in October 2022 were exercised for net proceeds of approximately $1.1\nmillion.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our\nassets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management\nand directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management's evaluation included such\nelements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control\nenvironment. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31,\n2023, because of the material weaknesses identified below. This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent\n78\nTable of Contents\nregistered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as allowed by the SEC.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting because we\nfailed to design and implement adequate internal controls over financial reporting as it relates to the proper fair value methodologies and assumptions used\nto value Level 3 instruments. Our management, with oversight from our Audit Committee, is in the process of developing and implementing remediation\nplans in response to the identified material weakness.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2023, management identified a material weakness in our recording of stock - based compensation because we\nfailed to design and implement adequate internal controls over the recording of such transactions. Our management has developed a remediation plan that\nwill allow such transactions to be properly recorded in the future through the implementation of a control design change and the addition of personnel to\nthe accounting function. This remediation plan, with oversight from our Audit Committee, is in the process of implementation in response to the identified\nmaterial weakness.\nDuring the period ended December 31, 2023, management also identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as a\nresult of the limited number of staff in our finance and accounting function. It is difficult to design and maintain appropriate segregation of duties in the\ninitiation, recording, and approval of transactions within financial systems with a limited number of personnel. This, coupled with management having not\ndesigned and maintained user access controls that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, and the absence of sufficient other\nmitigating controls, created a segregation of duties weakness which could potentially have resulted in a material misstatement. Management has identified\nremediation actions that require the addition of personnel to the finance and accounting function, which will allow the Company to design the control\nenvironment in a manner that provides effective segregation of duties, beginning with personnel having been added to the finance function in early 2024.\nThe material weaknesses described herein did not result in any identified material misstatements in the consolidated financial statements, and there were no\nchanges to our historical consolidated financial statements. Notwithstanding such material weaknesses, our consolidated financial statements and other\nfinancial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations, and\ncash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting. There have not been any significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting other than the material weaknesses and related remediation measures as described above.\nImportant Considerations. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that\nthe objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future\nevents. The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in\ndecision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.\nBecause of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures will be\nsuccessful in achieving its stated goals, including but not limited to preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely\nmanner to the appropriate levels of management, under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nItem 9B.

There is no guarantee that the top-line\ndate will support our NDA submission or that the FDA will approve iopofosine I 131 for commercial use. Even if we receive FDA approval, we\nmay not be able to successfully commercialize iopofosine I 131.\n3. The null hypothesis assumes a placebo effect of 10% combined with a 10% exclusion rate. This provides a null hypothesis of 20%. Said\nanother way, if the lower bound of the two-tail test using a 95% confidence interval is greater than 20%, the null hypothesis, which states that\nthere is no benefit with treatment with iopofosine, is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is acceptance – there is a statistical benefit of\ntreating with iopofosine in this patient population. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a 95% two-sided confidence interval calculated\nby the Clopper-Pearson method.\n4.
