This inaugural report details the performance and management of NeoGenomics’ commitment to its core values of quality, integrity, accountability, teamwork, and innovation. \n\n“Releasing our first ESG report marks an important milestone in NeoGenomics’ growth and evolution,” said Chris Smith, CEO at NeoGenomics. “Through these efforts, we have established foundational pillars to serve as a beacon for building a sustainable company that provides exceptional customer experience and advanced testing options.” \n\nThe 2023 ESG Report measures progress on key sustainability focus areas, including Customer Privacy, Data and Cybersecurity, Recruitment, Development and Retention, Business Ethics, Product Quality and Safety, Legal and Regulatory Environment, and Environmental Stewardship. \n\nHighlights of the report include: \n\n  * **Progressing diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging efforts.** NeoGenomics continues its commitment to maintaining a supportive workplace, which includes investing in ongoing opportunities for teammate development in a diverse and inclusive environment.

(NASDAQ: NEO) (the** “**Company** ”**),** a leading oncology testing services company, today announced its third-quarter results for the period ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights As Compared To Third Quarter 2023**  \n---  \n  \n  * **Consolidated revenue increased 10% to $168 million**\n  * **Clinical Services revenue increased 14% to $146 million**\n  * **Advanced Diagnostics revenue decreased 10% to $22 million**\n  * **Net loss decreased 4% to $18 million**\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA increased 305% to positive $13 million**\n\n  \n  \n“We delivered a strong third quarter, again growing revenue by double digits and increasing adjusted EBITDA by over 300%, all while serving a record number of patients,” said Chris Smith, Chief Executive Officer of NeoGenomics. “Our results demonstrate our teammates' commitment to executing on our strategic priorities. This disciplined approach has enabled us to increase our adjusted EBITDA expectations for the year while continuing to position the Company for long term, sustainable growth.” \n\n**Third-Quarter Results**\n\nConsolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $168 million, an increase of 10% over the same period in 2023. Clinical Services revenue of $146 million increased year-over-year by 14%. Clinical test volume(1) increased by 9% year-over-year. Average revenue per clinical test (“revenue per test”) increased by 5% to $463. These increases in Clinical Services reflect higher value tests, including NGS, and strategic reimbursement initiatives. Advanced Diagnostics revenue decreased by 10% to $22 million compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by international site closures, restructuring activities and lower RaDaR® revenue. \n\nConsolidated gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $74.9 million, an increase of 20.2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs. Consolidated gross profit margin, including amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, was 44.6%. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin(2), excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, was 47.8%. \n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $96 million, an increase of $10 million, or 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses included higher compensation and benefit costs as well as an increase in legal and professional fees including a settlement payment for IP litigation. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in restructuring activities. \n\nNet loss for the quarter decreased $1 million, or 4%, to $18 million compared to net loss of $19 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA(2) increased $10 million, or 305%, to positive $13 million compared to positive $3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted Net Income(2) was $7 million compared to Adjusted Net Loss(2) of $0.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $388 million at quarter end. \n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**(3)\n\nThe Company again revised its full-year 2024 guidance(3), as previously revised on July 29, 2024. \n\n**FY 2023** |  **Previously Revised****FY 2024 Guidance** |  **Revised****FY 2024 Guidance**(3) |  **YOY % Change from FY 2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n(in millions)  |  **Actual** |  **Low** |  **High** |  **Low** |  **High** |  **Low** |  **High**  \nConsolidated revenue  |  $  |  592  |  $  |  655  |  $  |  667  |  $  |  655  |  $  |  667  |  11  |  %  |  13  |  %   \nNet loss  |  $  |  (88  |  )  |  $  |  (88  |  )  |  $  |  (81  |  )  |  $  |  (81  |  )  |  $  |  (78  |  )  |  8  |  %  |  11  |  %   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  3  |  $  |  33  |  $  |  37  |  $  |  37  |  $  |  40  |  1133  |  %  |  1233  |  %   \n  \n______________________________________ \n\n(1) |  Clinical testing excludes tests and revenue for Advanced Diagnostics.   \n---|---  \n(2) |  The Company has provided adjusted financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Net (Loss) Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain income and/or expense items that management believes are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating results and/or certain items that are inconsistent in amounts and frequency, making it difficult to perform a meaningful evaluation of our current or past operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of operating results using non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors by facilitating the analysis of the Company’s core test-level operating results across reporting periods and when comparing those same results to those published by our peers. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in evaluating future prospects. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making, planning and forecasting purposes and to manage the business. These non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of financial information in accordance with U.S. GAAP financial results, should not be considered measures of liquidity, and are unlikely to be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies. \n\n**Definitions of Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined by NeoGenomics as net (loss) income from continuing operations before: (i) interest income, (ii) interest expense, (iii) tax (benefit) or expense, (iv) depreciation and amortization expense, (v) stock-based compensation expense, and, if applicable in a reporting period, (vi) restructuring charges, (vii) intellectual property (“IP”) litigation costs, (viii) CEO transition costs, and (ix) other significant or non-operating (income) or expenses, net. \n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Cost of Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin\n\n“Adjusted cost of revenue” is defined by NeoGenomics as cost of revenue before: (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, and, if applicable in a reporting period, (ii) stock-based compensation expense. \n\n“Adjusted gross profit” is defined by NeoGenomics as total revenue less adjusted cost of revenue. \n\n“Adjusted gross profit margin” is defined by NeoGenomics as adjusted cost of revenue divided by total revenue. \n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net (Loss) Income\n\n“Adjusted net (loss) income” is defined by NeoGenomics as net (loss) income from continuing operations plus: (i) amortization of intangible assets, (ii) stock-based compensation expense, and, if applicable in a reporting period, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv) IP litigation costs, (v) CEO transition costs, and (vi) other significant or non-operating (income) or expenses, net. If GAAP net (loss) income is negative and adjusted net (loss) income is positive, adjusted net (loss) income will also be adjusted to reverse any recognized interest expense (including any amortization of discounts) on the convertible notes using the if-converted method unless the effect of this adjustment on both the adjusted net (loss) income and weighted average diluted common shares outstanding would be anti-dilutive. If GAAP net (loss) income is positive and adjusted net (loss) income is negative, adjusted net (loss) income will also be adjusted to reverse any recognized interest expense (including any amortization of discounts) on the convertible notes using the if-converted method. \n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Diluted EPS\n\n“Adjusted diluted EPS” is defined by NeoGenomics as adjusted net (loss) income divided by adjusted diluted shares outstanding. If GAAP net (loss) income is negative and adjusted net (loss) income is positive, adjusted diluted shares outstanding will also include any options or restricted stock that would be outstanding as dilutive instruments using the treasury stock method and the weighted average number of common shares that would be outstanding if the convertible notes were converted into common stock on the original issue date based on the number of days such common shares would have been outstanding in the reporting period, until the effect of these adjustments are anti-dilutive. If GAAP net (loss) income is positive and adjusted net (loss) income is negative, adjusted diluted shares outstanding will exclude any options or restricted stock that would be outstanding as dilutive instruments using the treasury stock method and the weighted average number of common shares that would be outstanding if the convertible notes were converted into common stock on the original issue date based on the number of days such common shares would have been outstanding in the reporting period. \n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) (unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Net loss (GAAP)** |  $  |  (17,699  |  )  |  $  |  (18,516  |  )  |  $  |  (63,402  |  )  |  $  |  (73,642  |  )   \n_Adjustments to net loss:_  \nInterest income  |  (4,673  |  )  |  (4,525  |  )  |  (14,099  |  )  |  (12,057  |  )   \nInterest expense  |  1,642  |  1,685  |  4,993  |  5,226   \nIncome tax benefit  |  (150  |  )  |  (2,935  |  )  |  (1,145  |  )  |  (8,169  |  )   \nDepreciation  |  9,623  |  9,349  |  29,274  |  27,872   \nAmortization of intangibles  |  8,362  |  8,784  |  25,085  |  26,350   \n**EBITDA (non-GAAP)** |  $  |  (2,895  |  )  |  $  |  (6,158  |  )  |  $  |  (19,294  |  )  |  $  |  (34,420  |  )   \n_Further adjustments to EBITDA:_  \nCEO transition costs  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  500   \nStock-based compensation expense  |  8,470  |  7,180  |  25,085  |  17,643   \nRestructuring charges  |  1,009  |  2,125  |  4,951  |  9,883   \nIP litigation costs(4) |  6,113  |  —  |  12,356  |  —   \nOther significant expenses, net(5) |  677  |  158  |  4,637  |  532   \n**Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)** |  $  |  13,374  |  $  |  3,305  |  $  |  27,735  |  $  |  (5,862  |  )   \n  \n_________________ \n\n(4) |  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, IP litigation costs include a legal fees and a settlement payment.

These increases in Clinical\nServices reflect higher value tests, including NGS, and strategic reimbursement initiatives.\nAdvanced Diagnostics revenue decreased by 10% to $22 million compared to the third\nquarter of 2023 primarily driven by international site closures, restructuring activities and\nlower RaDaR® revenue.\nConsolidated gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $74.9 million, an increase of\n20.2% compared to the third quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increase\nin revenue partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs.

Adjusted Gross Profit Margin(2), excluding amortization\nof acquired intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, was 47.8%.\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $96 million, an increase of $10 million,\nor 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2023. Operating expenses included higher\ncompensation and benefit costs as well as an increase in legal and professional fees\nincluding a settlement payment for IP litigation. These increases were partially offset by a\ndecrease in restructuring activities.\nNet loss for the quarter decreased $1 million, or 4%, to $18 million compared to net loss of\n$19 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA(2) increased $10 million, or 305%, to positive $13 million compared to\npositive $3 million in the third quarter of 2023.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude\ncertain income and/or expense items that management believes are not directly attributable\nto the Company’s core operating results and/or certain items that are inconsistent in\namounts and frequency, making it difficult to perform a meaningful evaluation of our current\nor past operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of operating\nresults using non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to\ninvestors by facilitating the analysis of the Company’s core test-level operating results\nacross reporting periods and when comparing those same results to those published by our\npeers. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in evaluating future\nprospects. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures for financial and\noperational decision making, planning and forecasting purposes and to manage the\nbusiness. These non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of financial\ninformation in accordance with U.S. GAAP financial results, should not be considered\nmeasures of liquidity, and are unlikely to be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures\nprovided by other companies.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n“Adjusted EBITDA” is defined by NeoGenomics as net (loss) income from continuing\noperations before: (i) interest income, (ii) interest expense, (iii) tax (benefit) or expense, (iv)\ndepreciation and amortization expense, (v) stock-based compensation expense, and, if\napplicable in a reporting period, (vi) restructuring charges, (vii) intellectual property (“IP”)\nlitigation costs, (viii) CEO transition costs, and (ix) other significant or non-operating\n(income) or expenses, net.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Cost of Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit\nMargin\n“Adjusted cost of revenue” is defined by NeoGenomics as cost of revenue before: (i)\namortization of acquired intangible assets, and, if applicable in a reporting period, (ii) stock-\nbased compensation expense.\n“Adjusted gross profit” is defined by NeoGenomics as total revenue less adjusted cost of\nrevenue.\n“Adjusted gross profit margin” is defined by NeoGenomics as adjusted cost of revenue\ndivided by total revenue.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net (Loss) Income\n“Adjusted net (loss) income” is defined by NeoGenomics as net (loss) income from\ncontinuing operations plus: (i) amortization of intangible assets, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense, and, if applicable in a reporting period, (iii) restructuring charges, (iv)\nIP litigation costs, (v) CEO transition costs, and (vi) other significant or non-operating\n(income) or expenses, net. If GAAP net (loss) income is negative and adjusted net (loss)\nincome is positive, adjusted net (loss) income will also be adjusted to reverse any\nrecognized interest expense (including any amortization of discounts) on the convertible\nnotes using the if-converted method unless the effect of this adjustment on both the\nadjusted net (loss) income and weighted average diluted common shares outstanding would\nbe anti-dilutive. If GAAP net (loss) income is positive and adjusted net (loss) income is\nnegative, adjusted net (loss) income will also be adjusted to reverse any recognized interest\nexpense (including any amortization of discounts) on the convertible notes using the if-\nconverted method.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Diluted EPS\n“Adjusted diluted EPS” is defined by NeoGenomics as adjusted net (loss) income divided by\nadjusted diluted shares outstanding. If GAAP net (loss) income is negative and adjusted net\n(loss) income is positive, adjusted diluted shares outstanding will also include any options or\nrestricted stock that would be outstanding as dilutive instruments using the treasury stock\nmethod and the weighted average number of common shares that would be outstanding if\nthe convertible notes were converted into common stock on the original issue date based on\nthe number of days such common shares would have been outstanding in the reporting\nperiod, until the effect of these adjustments are anti-dilutive. If GAAP net (loss) income is\npositive and adjusted net (loss) income is negative, adjusted diluted shares outstanding will\nexclude any options or restricted stock that would be outstanding as dilutive instruments\nusing the treasury stock method and the weighted average number of common shares that\nwould be outstanding if the convertible notes were converted into common stock on the\noriginal issue date based on the number of days such common shares would have been\noutstanding in the reporting period.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\n(in thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss (GAAP) $ (17,699) $ (18,516) $ (63,402) $ (73,642)\nAdjustments to net loss:\nInterest income (4,673) (4,525) (14,099) (12,057)\nInterest expense 1,642 1,685 4,993 5,226\nIncome tax benefit (150) (2,935) (1,145) (8,169)\nDepreciation 9,623 9,349 29,274 27,872\nAmortization of intangibles 8,362 8,784 25,085 26,350\nEBITDA (non-GAAP) $ (2,895) $ (6,158) $ (19,294) $ (34,420)\nFurther adjustments to EBITDA:\nCEO transition costs — — — 500\nStock-based compensation expense 8,470 7,180 25,085 17,643\nRestructuring charges 1,009 2,125 4,951 9,883\nIP litigation costs(4) 6,113 — 12,356 —\nOther significant expenses, net(5) 677 158 4,637 532\n$ 13,374 $ 3,305 $ 27,735 $ (5,862)\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n_________________\n(4) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, IP litigation costs include a legal fees and a settlement payment.

The information set forth herein does not purport to be complete or\nto contain all of the information you may desire. Statements contained herein are made as of the date of this presentation unless stated otherwise, and neither this presentation,\nnor any sale of securities, shall under any circumstances create an implication that the information contained herein is correctas of any time after such date or that information\nwill be updated or revised to reflect information that subsequently becomes available or changes occurring after the date hereof.\nThis presentation contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 relating to business, operations, and financial\nconditions of the Company. Words such as, but not limited to, “look forward to,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “suggest”, “project”, “forecast”, “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “would,”\n“should” and “could,” and similar expressions or words, identify forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking\nstatements are based upon reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that its expectations will be realized. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in\nthe Company’s forward-looking statements due to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this\npresentation and are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise orupdate this presentation to reflect events or\ncircumstances after the date hereof.\nInformation contained in this presentation concerning our industry and the markets in which we operate, including our general expectations and market position, market\nopportunity and market size, is based on information from various sources, on assumptions that we have made that are based on such information and other similar sources and\non our knowledge of, and expectations about, the markets for our service offerings. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not\nto give undue weight to such estimates.\nThis presentation contains financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross margin and adjusted net income, which areconsiderednon-GAAPfinancial measures\nunder applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations. These non-GAAPfinancial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a\nsubstitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). AdjustedEBITDA, adjusted gross margin and adjusted net\nincome, unusual or other items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. The Company’s definitions of thesenon-GAAPmeasures may differ from\nsimilarly titled measures used by others. The Company generally uses these non-GAAPfinancial measures to facilitate management’s financial and operational decision-making,\nincluding evaluation of the Company’s historical operating results, comparison to competitors’ operating results and determination of management incentive compensation.\nThese non-GAAPfinancial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to\ncorresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business. Because non-GAAPfinancial\nmeasures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company’s reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAPfinancial measures to the most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measures are included in the tables in this presentation. We cannot estimate or project these items and they may have a substantial and unpredictable impact on\nour results presented in accordance with GAAP.\n2\nMission\nWe save lives by improving patient care.\nVision\nWe are becoming the world’s leading\nprovider of comprehensive cancer testing,\ndata and solutions through uncompromising\nquality, exceptional customer experience,\nand innovative products and services.\nWe focus on the ~85% of patients\nreceiving care in community setting\nWe treat patients in their own communities\n~85% ~15% Academic hospitals/\nCommunity Setting\ncancer centers\nCommunity\nsetting offers:\n• More personalized\ncare, strong patient-\nprovider relationships\n• Accessibility,\nproximity to home\nand loved ones\n• Cost-effectiveness\nNIH, National Cancer Institute \"Bringing Research 4\nto the Community to Reduce Cancer Disparities,\"\nSeptember 2017\nOur Community Translation Platform\nIs core to our Long-Term Market Differentiation\nAcademic Oncology\nCenters and Biopharma\n• Broad oncology test menu (600+); Flexible partnership model (TC/PC)\n• Comprehensive oncology offerings in Solid and Heme targeted to\ncommunity generalist\nCustomer Experience\n• Best-in-class TAT’s; Geographically balanced footprint\nOperational Excellence • Operating efficiencies driving lower COGS\n• LIMS and automation\nInteroperability\n• Delivery through customer portal or bi-directional EMR integration\n• Unified result delivery channel across all testing modalities\n• Simplified, user-friendly and operationally seamless\nCommunity Setting\nPathology and Oncology\n5\nMomentum Continues\nClinical Volume (unit thousands) Clinical Revenue Per Test\n3Q 2024 Highlights 9% 5%\n$463\n315\n312\n• Double digit revenue growth\n$454\n• Testing volumes increased 9% vs prior year\n301\n$447\n• Adjusted Gross Margin increased to 48% 295\n$441\n$440\n290\n• 26% growth in NGS revenue\n• AEBITDA improves 305% with 5 consecutive\nquarters of positive AEBITDA\nQ3'23 Q4'23 Q1'24 Q2'24 Q3'24 Q3'23 Q4'23 Q1'24 Q2'24 Q3'24\n• Over 350,000 specimens accessioned\nRevenues ($millions) Adj.
