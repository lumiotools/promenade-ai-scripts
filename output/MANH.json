Those statements, including the guidance provided above, are forward looking. Actual results may differ materially. See our cautionary note regarding “forward-looking statements” below.\n\nManhattan Associates will make this earnings release and published expectations available on the investor relations section of the Manhattan Associates website at [ir.manh.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.manh.com%2F&esheet=54139872&newsitemid=20241022598637&lan=en-US&anchor=ir.manh.com&index=1&md5=4f33378df5eb2e739d246f1f27b4f202). Following publication of this earnings release, any expectations with respect to future financial performance contained in this release, including the guidance, should be considered historical only, and Manhattan Associates disclaims any obligation to update them.\n\n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nManhattan Associates’ conference call regarding its third quarter financial results will be held today, October 22, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The Company will also discuss its business and expectations for the year and next quarter in additional detail during the call. We invite investors to a live webcast of the conference call through the Investor Relations section of the Manhattan Associates website at [ir.manh.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fir.manh.com%2F&esheet=54139872&newsitemid=20241022598637&lan=en-US&anchor=ir.manh.com&index=2&md5=eee572aa49d27643f6d86751ab6291fa). To listen to the live webcast, please go to the website at least 15 minutes before the call to download and install any necessary audio software. The Internet webcast will be available until Manhattan Associates’ fourth quarter 2024 earnings release.\n\n**GAAP VERSUS NON-GAAP PRESENTATION**\n\nManhattan Associates provides adjusted operating income and margin, adjusted income tax provision, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in this press release as additional information regarding the Company’s historical and projected operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or alternatives to, GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The Company believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors’ ability to understand and compare the Company’s results and guidance, because the measures provide supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of its business, as distinct from results that include items not indicative of ongoing operating results, and because the Company believes its peers typically publish similar non-GAAP measures. This release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Form 8-K earnings release filing for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating income and margin, adjusted income tax provision, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the impact of equity-based compensation – net of income tax effects. They also exclude the tax benefits or deficiencies of vested stock awards caused by differences in the amount deductible for tax purposes from the compensation expense recorded for financial reporting purposes. We include reconciliations of the Company’s GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP adjustments in the supplemental information attached to this release.\n\n**ABOUT MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES**\n\nManhattan Associates is a global technology leader in supply chain and omnichannel commerce. We unite information across the enterprise, converging front-end sales with back-end supply chain execution.

We do not receive a GAAP tax benefit for a portion of our equity-based compensation, mainly because of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits tax deductions for compensation granted to certain executives.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**|  2023| **2024**|  2023  \nCost of services| **$10,835**|  $7,643| **$31,482**|  $21,337  \nResearch and development| **5,117**|  4,141| **15,812**|  11,711  \nSales and marketing| **2,189**|  1,878| **6,295**|  5,333  \nGeneral and administrative| **5,712**|  5,368| **17,025**|  15,217  \nTotal equity-based compensation| **$23,853**|  $19,030| **$70,614**|  $53,598  \n  \n(b)| Adjustments represent the excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies of the equity awards vested during the period. Excess tax benefits (deficiencies) occur when the amount deductible on our tax return for an equity award is more (less) than the cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes. As discussed above, we exclude equity-based compensation from adjusted non-GAAP results to be consistent with other companies in the software industry and for the other reasons explained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Therefore, we also exclude the related tax benefit (expense) generated upon their vesting.  \n---|---  \n  \n**MANHATTAN ASSOCIATES, INC.
