Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We have a lot\nto cover, as much has been accomplished since our last call three months ago. During this period,\nwe materially advanced our AirSCWO technology along the path towards commercialization, as\nwell as expanded its ability to destroy a wide range of organic waste streams. In addition, we\ndeployed our AirSCWO system to Orlando and are now actively integrating our technology into\ntheir wastewater treatment plant. Further, we temporarily relocated our core manufacturing\noperations to a large facility just outside Orlando to accommodate our increased manufacturing\nfootprint needs, and, finally, we made multiple key hires across our organization. We will cover\nthese and other important matters during our time together.\nI'd like to start with a discussion of our technology. We believe our AirSCWO system sits at the\nforefront of cleantech innovation, offering a vital solution to global wastewater treatment and\nwaste destruction challenges. The core of our system is our patented supercritical water oxidation\ntechnology designed to permanently destroy and mineralize a broad spectrum of organic, non-\nhazardous and hazardous waste streams, producing dischargeable clean water, safe mineral\neffluent, safe vent gas and recoverable heat energy. Our technology is designed to handle\ntraditional wastes such as biosolids, landfill leachate, oily sludge, foam, fractionate, military\nwastes, and organic industrial wastes, as well as emerging contaminants such as PFAS, pesticides\nand microplastics from municipal, federal and industrial waste streams.\nWe have made substantial progress in our AirSCWO product development activities and have seen\nmaterial improvements in our technology as we continue along the path towards\ncommercialization. Recent improvements have enhanced system reliability, precision and\nefficiency, which we believe have prepared us for large scale deployment. Based on the testing\nconducted at Merrell Brothers for the past 18 months, we upgraded our reactor design to broaden\nits capabilities, upgrade our intake feed process to harden and improve reliability under severe\nconditions, improved and distributed our electrical systems to be simpler and more reliable, and\nupgraded trim fueling and temperature control systems for precise process control, enabling the\nAirSCWO system to operate at steady state when processing waste. These improvements were all\naimed at simplifying operations and improving reliability. With this progress, the AirSCWO\nsystem has been moved to Orlando to begin demonstrating its capabilities to process sludge for an\nextended duration under full load while being fed online directly from Orlando's wastewater\ntreatment facility. In addition to sludge processing, we will also conduct demonstrations\nprocessing other PFAS contaminated materials, including AFFF. We are now integrating our\nsystem into Orlando's operations and I will discuss our Orlando deployment more fully later in this\ncall.\nTranscript Provided by\nWe currently plan to offer four commercial scale AirSCWOs models to meet the destruction\ncapacity needs we see across our municipal, federal and industrial end markets. Our AS1\n[Phonetic] is designed to process up to one metric ton of wet waste per day. This unit is a highly\nmobile unit designed for rapid deployment for site cleanup and other emergency services at\nmunicipal, federal and industrial facilities. Over the short term, we intend to utilize this highly\nmobile unit to perform on site, short duration destruction demonstrations throughout the US.\nOur AS6 [Phonetic] is designed to process up to six metric tons of wet waste per day and is also\nmobile. The AS6 will service small municipal and industrial wastewater and water treatment plants\nand federal agency sites. Our AS30 [Phonetic] is designed to process up to 30 metric tons of wet\nwaste per day and we will be semi permanent. We believe the AS30 will generate strong demand\nwithin our municipal and industrial segments who process upwards of 6 million gallons per day of\nwastewater and we envision this unit to be ideal for regional TSDFs and landfills.\nOur AS100 [Phonetic] is designed to process up to 100 metric tons of wet waste per day and will\nbe a permanent installation. We believe the AS100 will be ideal for large or regional, municipal\nand industrial facilities. The AS100 is a bespoke system which we will design based on specific\ncustomer needs.\nNow let's turn to the wastewater treatment and destruction market. We believe the global market\nopportunity for our AirSCWO waste destruction technology to be measured in the hundreds of\nbillions of dollars. While the global market is truly massive, we consciously decided to focus our\nefforts on cultivating the US market first and have pulled back from international engagement at\nthis time. With this in mind, we have a robust pipeline of municipal, federal and industrial\nopportunities worth approximately 1.6 billion and growing. This public awareness of emerging\ncontaminants grows. Traditional technologies focused on waste removal such as land application,\nlandfill, incineration, deep well injection and hauling and storage, which changed the market\ndecades ago, are now increasingly viewed as insufficient as they only move the problem in liability\nfrom one medium, one geography and one organization to another.\nWe believe our commercial scale AirSCWO system will offer a comprehensive and final solution\nfor the most challenging organic wet waste. This elegant, effective process is designed to eliminate\norganic waste, preventing toxins from entering our lands, waters and bodies. From a cost\nperspective, we believe our technology is competitive with current waste removal alternatives\nwhen concerning all cradle to grave costs, including future liabilities. Legal settlements and federal\nremediation budgets indicate substantial financial obligations associated with these liabilities.\nRecent EPA regulations, state mandates, and the bipartisan concerns over emerging contaminants\nensure that stricter and more robust disposal practices and requirements will continue regardless\nof the November election. These developments are accelerating the transition, which was already\nwell underway, to emerging commercial scale destruction solutions like our AirSCWO system.\nWith this background in mind, let's discuss the markets in which we participate. First, the 120\nbillion US municipal wastewater and drinking water management market, which includes over\n16,000 wastewater plants that treat 34 billion gallons of wastewater daily and produce 87,000 wet\nTranscript Provided by\ntons of sludge daily approximately 200 water utilities, which produce 4 billion cubic feet, or 29\nbillion gallons of spent GAC or ion exchange resin, annually. 950 municipal landfills, which\nproduce leachate that is discharged to wastewater treatment plants and more than 52,000 state and\nlocal firefighting units, which are storing millions of gallons of toxic firefighting foam called\nAFFF. All these sectors have waste streams which must be disposed off or destroyed.\nSecond, the 15 billion us federal waste management market includes 715 DoD sites, 50 DOE sites,\nand 150 airports under the oversight of the FAA. These agencies have stockpiles of waste streams\nsuch as AFFF firefighting foam, chemicals, narcotics, biosolids, and other wastes which must be\ntreated, stored, or destroyed. To highlight the magnitude of the issue, the federal government\nrecently appropriated $400 million to clean up Pease Air National Guard Base in New Hampshire.\nThis is only one of 715 DoD sites which require cleanup. In fact, industry experts have estimated\nDoD cleanup alone will cost 250 billion, and we believe this number could grow materially over\ntime.\nThird, the 80 billion us industrial waste management market includes a diverse group of industries,\nfrom landfills and oil and gas to healthcare and battery manufacturing verticals. Industrial\nmanufacturing facilities generate tons and tons of organic waste annually that are either pre treated\non site and discharged to wastewater treatment plants, treated and directly discharged into our\nwater bodies or transported offsite for expensive treatment and disposable of final residuals.\nDownstream handlers and disposal facilities are now beginning to reject waste material because\nof the increasing threat of liability and remediation costs. There currently is no final, impermanent\ndestruction solution for these waste streams. Our goal is to be that solution.\nWhile the industrial market is a broad category, we are actively pursuing opportunities within the\nlandfill leache, oil and gas, pharmaceutical and battery markets. We recently highlighted the\napplicability of our technology in the pharmaceutical industry in lithium ion battery\nmanufacturing, and recycling industry. Together, these two industries represent a market\nopportunity of more than 1 billion annually in the US alone. During future calls, we will further\nelaborate on the opportunities we are pursuing within the industrial market segment. Fourth, the\nus treatment, storage and disposal facility, or TSDF market includes more than 860 RCRA\noperating permitted sites in the US. This market consists of independent service providers who\noffer waste disposal solutions to the broader market, private companies with their own onsite\ndisposal technologies, and military sites. TSDF storage techniques include containers, tanks, drip\npads, and waste piles. TSDF treatment techniques include various processes such as blending,\nneutralizing, incinerating, and land treatment, which are designed to make waste less hazardous,\nalter its composition, or outright destroy it and TSDF waste disposal methods include landfilling,\ndeep well injection, and outright storage. Customers in all three markets that we target, municipal,\nfederal, and industrial work with TSDFs across the US for certain ways, at times exclusively.\nNow, let's turn to our near-term areas of focus. During our Q1 call, we discussed our intention to\nmeet our contractual obligations within the municipal and federal markets, commercialize\nAirSCWO and expand our market opportunities, secure strategic disposal facility partnerships,\nexpand our team, and expand our laboratory, engineering and manufacturing operations. First, let's\nturn to our intention to meet our contractual obligations. On the municipal side, we are contracted\nto perform waste destruction demonstrations with the City of Orlando Water Reclamation division,\nTranscript Provided by\nwhich is the fifth largest wastewater facility in Florida; and Orange County Sanitation District, the\nthird largest wastewater treatment facility in California. On the federal side, we have signed waste\ndestruction demonstration contracts with multiple federal agencies, which must be completed\nduring 2024 and 2025.\nAs mentioned earlier, we've deployed our AirSCWO systems in the City of Orlando's Iron Bridge\nWater Pollution Control facility and our technology is now on site. Our team has begun integrating\nour technology into Orlando's operations, a process estimated to take four to six weeks. Note, we\nhave shared pictures of the Orlando facility and our technology on-site through social media.\nDuring our Orlando residency, we are planning a seven-month full-scale demonstration where we\nwill process biosolids as well as complete several previously announced federal agency PFAS\ndestruction demonstrations. We will provide updates once our system is operational.\n374Water is also building a second AirSCWO system for delivery to Orange County Sanitation in\n2025. Prior to this deployment, we will complete a factory acceptance test and, upon delivery, the\nsystem will undergo a six-month operational period managed by 374Water engineers, followed by\nanother six-month operational period managed by OCSAN staff. Following our successful\ndemonstrations, the City of Orlando and OCSAN have announced their intentions to upgrade to\nour larger AS30 system and have already secured relevant funding. Following the AS30\ninstallations, OCSAN also intends to purchase multiple AS100 units to manage waste for their\nentire plant. The City of Orlando has expressed a similar intent.\nThese municipal and federal destruction demonstrations mark important milestones in our efforts\nto advance our AirSCWO technology and serve as critical proof points on the efficacy of our\ntechnology. We also believe these demonstrations will generate even further demand across our\nmunicipal, federal, and industrial market segments.\nSecond, we are focused on commercializing our AirSCWO technology in expanding its use case.\nTo this end, we are building additional AirSCWO units to increase the pace of waste destruction\ndemonstrations and accelerate our technology development efforts across waste streams. To be\nclear, my mandate over the next 12 to 18 months is to commercialize our AirSCWO system. We\nare currently building a second AS6 earmarked for OCSAN and have plans to build a third to\ncomplete other large-scale demonstrations and extended customer residencies. We are also\nbuilding our first mobile AS1 unit and plan to begin building a second in the near-term. Until now,\nour capacity to complete waste destruction demonstrations has been limited due to having only\none AirSCWO system. The construction of these AS1 units will help reduce the bottleneck,\nallowing us to more rapidly conduct waste destruction demonstrations across our market verticals.\nIn addition, we plan to begin designing the AS30 unit in 2024 and hope to begin manufacturing\nour first unit sometime in 2025. We currently envision the first two AS30 units will be earmarked\nfor the City of Orlando and OCSAN, though we are also fielding interest from other industry\nparticipants across these larger capacity units as well. Our AirSCWO system also includes pre-\ntreatment and post-treatment solutions. These solutions include dewatering, buffering, and pH\ncontrol to name a few features. These solutions ensure our AirSCWO system received waste in the\nright form for ease of processing and destruction. As we encounter new forms of waste, the pre\nand post-treatment processes may be adjusted or refined.\nTranscript Provided by\nFinally, our laboratory has been extremely active, completing a wide range of AirSCWO's\ntreatability studies across industries. Our lab has been so busy; in fact, we made the decision to\nmore than double our lab and testing capacity. We use our lab-based AirSCWO system to qualify\nthe treatability of waste streams and the process parameters for our commercial scale AirSCWO\nsystem. In addition to being a vital R&D tool, this is a revenue-generating business for our\ncompany and our initial sales tool for demonstrating the capabilities of our AirSCWO technology.\nThird, we are in active discussions with TSDF partners to build our destruction-as-a-service\nbusiness. Our strategy here is multifold. First, we seek to create partnerships with independent\nservice providers in relevant geographies across the US. These entities not only hold the necessary\nfederal and state non-hazardous and hazardous waste permits, but also accept millions of gallons\nor tons of waste every year from customers in our three markets. We believe these on-site\ndeployments could secure joint long-term recurring revenue opportunities for our destruction-as-\na-service business and our TSDF partners.\nSecond, we seek to partner with private companies that operate their own permitted disposal\ntechnologies. Increasingly, chemical, petroleum, pesticide, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, and\nother heavy industrial manufacturers operate their own disposal facilities and technologies to save\ncosts, limit liability, and increased sustainability. We believe our waste destruction technology\ncould be appealing to this subset of customers also. As we move forward, there are multiple\nrevenue models we will explore in this sub-vertical.\nThe deployment to TSDF also allows us to test and demonstrate our AirSCWO technology on\nadditional hazardous waste streams, we would otherwise be unable to process. In addition, this\nwill enable us to work in concert with our TSDF partners in local, state, and federal regulators\ntransparently, especially for highly-sensitive waste like certain military waste. Further, these\ndeployments should also enable us to develop bespoke air quote systems to meet their specific\ncustomer needs. Finally, the emergence of the PFAS forever chemicals destruction market, for\nexample, the destruction of AFFF, GAC, IX, to name just a few, is a tailwind which should increase\ndemand for destruction technology at TSDF sites, as certain customers will require waste\ndestruction to take place at these permitted facilities.\nFourth, we are investing in our personnel across our organization to increase the pace of technology\ninnovation and accelerate product commercialization. We recently bolstered the leadership team\nwith the addition of Debbie Cooper, our Chief Administrative Officer and Chief of Staff. Deb has\ntremendous experience building and transforming organizations and has been a great asset in\nhelping us create more structure across our operations as well as building out our strategic plan to\nenhance our ability to execute on our obligations, while scaling operations to exploit new ones.\nI would also like to announce and welcome Pete Mandel as the newest member of our leadership\nteam. Pete is joining the organization as our full-time in-house General Counsel and will be starting\nwith us on August 19. Pete brings deep experience in corporate and securities laws serving in\nmultiple general counsel roles, along with extensive experience working in big law. He will be a\nkey adviser to our business and member of our leadership team as we continue to build our\nbusiness, secure strategic partnerships, and execute on our initiatives. I would like to thank Jeff\nTranscript Provided by\nQuick, who has served in both GC and interim CEO roles for all his contributions to our company\nover the past two years. Jeff will be providing an extended transition period with Pete to ensure\ncontinuity.\nIn addition, we initiated a search for a Chief Technology Officer, which is an important new\nposition at 374Water. The CTO will be charged with scaling our research, development, and\nengineering organization to bring the added structure to our company and accelerate our\ntechnology development and commercialization process. We have partnered with Spencer Stuart\nto assist us in securing the right CTO.\nAdditionally, we are actively recruiting engineers, field personnel, lab technicians, and\nmanufacturing talent to more rapidly commercialize our technology, complete technology\ndemonstrations, and engineer and build additional systems of various sizes. Finally, we are\nexpanding our engineering, manufacturing, and laboratory facilities to support our enhanced pace\nof technology development and product commercialization as well as to better serve our\ncustomers. We recently completed a residency at the Merrell Bros. HQ in Kokomo, Indiana, where\nwe were not only actively running, developing, and demonstrating our AirSCWO technology, but\nalso manufacturing our AirSCWO system and dewatering skills.\nAs part of our deployment to Orlando, we secured a short-term lease on a significantly larger\ndedicated manufacturing facility nearby to continue the deconstruction of our second AS6 unit as\nwell as begin manufacturing a highly mobile AS1. We will remain here until early next year when\nwe plan to secure an even larger facility to house our core engineering and manufacturing\noperations.\nWe also previously announced our intention to double the size and capacity of our lab operations\nand we will be accomplishing this with our move to a new facility in September. This expansion\nincludes the addition of a new AirSCWO system as well as new service offerings, which will\nenable us to broaden our capabilities and provide faster results for our growing list of clients. In\naddition, we believe this expansion will allow us to more rapidly validate the effectiveness of our\nAirSCWO technology across a broad range of organic waste streams to further expand the\napplication use case.\nWe are actively working on optimizing our operational efficiencies and exploring new market\nopportunities, all aimed at long-term value creation, while remaining steadfast in our commitment\nto innovation and excellence. A primary financial goal for the company is to extend its runway,\nwhile scaling the business. During our future earnings calls, we will provide further updates on\nour near-term strategic activities as well as provide a more in-depth discussion of our long-term\nstrategy and playbook process. While we have a lot of work to do, the future is truly bright and I'm\nexcited to be here.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Adrienne to update you on our financials.\nAdrienne Anderson - Chief Financial Officer, 374Water Inc.\nTranscript Provided by\nThank you, Chris. Today, I'll discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2024, which\nreflects our business evolution as we began scaling our business and enhancing our financial\nposition.\nI'll touch on a few key metrics for the first half of 2024. During the first half of the year, the\ncompany generated revenue of $352,000 compared to $851,000 for the six months of 2023. As we\nstart to reach the end of the assembly and fabrication work on our sold unit, our direct cost decline,\nwhich have a direct correlation to our decline in revenue of $499,000 in the first half of 2024\ncompared to 23%. This is based on our percentage of completion revenue recognition method.\nFurther, during the second quarter, we focused our attention on deploying our owned AirSCWO\nunit to the City of Orlando for the waste destruction demonstrations previously discussed.\nTotal operating expenses increased from $3.5 million in the first half of 2023 to $4.9 million in\nthe first half of 2024, driven primarily by an increase in our research and development expenses\nof approximately $474,000, and increase in our general and administrative expenses of\napproximately $250,000, and an increase in our professional fees of approximately $677,000. The\nincreases in our research and development and general and administrative expenses stem from our\ncontinued effort to commercialize our AirSCWO system and our strategic growth plan to ensure\nwe have sufficient personnel and an executive team to support our expected growth. The increase\nin our professional fees are primarily non-recurring expenses related to the settlement of a legal\nmatter and changes in our executive leadership and Board of Directors that occurred during the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we have a working capital of $7.2 million, consisting of $8.8 million of\ncurrent assets, comprised primarily of cash, receivables, and inventory, offset by $1.5 million of\ncurrent liabilities comprised of accounts payable and accrued expenses arising from the normal\ncourse of business. We currently have no outstanding debt obligations.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Chris.\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nThanks Adrienne. We would like to move to Q&A.\nOperator\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions]\nOur first question is coming from Tate Sullivan with Maxim Group. Your line is live.\nQ: Thank you. And thank you for the comments. Can you talk about what you liked about Orlando\nin terms of moving the first system to be deployed in Orlando and then also the lease space there?\nDid you also look at other states or other cities as well, please?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nTranscript Provided by\nYes. Yes, great question. So, when we were looking at deploying our technology, we were initially\ncontemplating and had announced previously that we were going to out to California and it's\nspecifically Orange County Sanitation. The reality is that the facility or our relationship going\ndown to Florida was such that we were actually able to perform other tests, not just biosolids tests\nat that facility. So, for us, it was much more optimal at this stage to go there to complete those\ntests. In conjunction with that, because we were busting at the seams in terms of our manufacturer\nand needing more space, we also chose to move down our manufacturing operations for the time\nbeing down to the Orlando area to continue to build out units. Ultimately, we are looking at\nmultiple other geographies for our much larger manufacturing facility, though we have not made\nany decision there yet.\nQ: And you mentioned the two inputs for the Orlando unit in terms of biosolids and PFAS tests.\nHow will that work? Will you have to unhook the unit from the biosolids stream and then do it on\n[inaudible] combine the inputs, how will you manage that process with two separate tests?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes, we'll do them in a separate tests, yes. So, we'll do biosolids processing and then we'll\nseparately perform these other tests, and it's an easy change out in terms of those waste streams.\nQ: Okay. And then you mentioned some service revenue and I know you're developing those that\nopportunity and more to come, but you did have services revenue in the second quarter. Can you\ndescribe what some of that is, please?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes, those are really related to our laboratory tests. So, we have a very active lab, which we are\nincreasing the size of that quite dramatically and about to move into a new facility, which is\nactually going to triple the square feet we have for our lab tests, where we're doing early destruction\ndemonstrations and then we move to much larger demonstrations, the commercial scale as\nnecessary.\nQ: And customers, industrial customers, municipal customers, pay you to see how you destroy\ntheir material? Is that correct?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes. What they're doing is they're paying us to understand the efficacy or the capability of our\nAirSCWO system to destroy their waste streams, and so it's across the board in terms of all of the\ndifferent markets and verticals that we are pursuing. We are receiving waste streams from them.\nWe bring them on site into our lab and then we perform these destruction tests, sometimes with\nthem in person, other times with them remote, but we are doing that and we are seeing an increase,\nI think, naturally, but a dramatic increase in demand for those types of services.\nQ: And similar to that when the unit is operational in Orlando, will you be paying -- will AirSCWO\nbe paying for the operating cost to the unit or will the City of Orlando?\nTranscript Provided by\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes. No, it will be us.\nQ: Okay. And then related to that, I noticed shifting the inventory to equipment and process in the\nquarter, so even when the first unit is operational, will you still have a retained ownership of that\nequipment as well?\nAdrienne Anderson - Chief Financial Officer, 374Water Inc.\nI can answer that, Chris. We do still maintain ownership of the unit in Orlando and, for the\nforeseeable future, I believe that will be an owned asset at this point. So, since we deployed the\nunit to Orlando, we reclassified the cost of that unit from inventory to a long-term asset.\nQ: Understood. And then last for me, and thank you for all the questions. You mentioned a lot of\nindications that interest you would frame the future units from California and Orlando for the\nlarger units or are they actual contracts at this point? How would you frame that?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes. So, we have direct interest on the AirSCWO 30s and those are all funded at this point. And\nthen we're in discussions with both organizations to move in from that to the much larger -- the\n100s, AS100s.\nQ: Excellent. Okay. Well, thank you for all the updates.\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes, absolutely. Thank you so much for the questions.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Graham Price with Raymond\nJames. Your line is live.\nQ: Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. So, first one for me, just wondering for\nboth Orlando and Orange County, just wondering if you can give a sense of how long the\ndemonstration phase will take before the agency feels ready to move into full-scale deployment?\nI just wanted to clarify, is that the seven months that you mentioned earlier or is that a longer\ntimeframe?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes. Yes, thanks for the question, and great to have you on the call here. Our demonstration with\nthe City of Orlando is that seven-month time period. And during that period, maybe we'll have\nTranscript Provided by\nearly indications, and they want to jump to immediately move to the 30 but, yes, that's the seven\nmonths. As far as Orange County Sanitation, we have two kind of periods. It's a total of a 12-\nmonth demonstration where we are running the unit ourselves for six months on site, and then it\ntransitions -- as we're training up their personnel, it would transition to their personnel running the\nunit for another six. Again, as we go through those demonstrations, we'll be obviously having\nactive dialogues with both organizations, which may accelerate the development and purchase of\nthe 30s.\nQ: Okay, got it. And maybe along those same lines, can you talk about some of the key metrics\nthat they'll be watching to make those determinations?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nWell, it will be throughput and the ability to process waste, how long it takes between, let's call it,\ndown cycles to do any repairs and maintenance and so forth. So, the key for them is they want to\nhave a technology that is fit-for-purpose and that we can schedule maintenance and go forth. And\nright now, we are focused on five days on, kind of, two days off schedule with them in the test.\nQ: Got it, understood. And then maybe lastly from me and thinking more broadly, just wondering\nhow you think about the EPA's regulation of PFAS and how that might change if we see a change\nin administration?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes, great question. I mean it's something we talk about internally all the time. I think in many\nways, the trains left the station on a lot of that. And when you look at the amount of litigation that's\noccurring in the space, certainly on the industrial side, with Dow and others, you're talking about\nhundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of potential awards that will take place. And so for\nme, while a new administration may slightly change the overall -- and this is all speculative, of\ncourse, but the required implementation time period, from my perspective, the train's left the\nstation and we're seeing an incredible amount of interest around our technology to deal with these\nPFAS contaminants.\nQ: Got it. Understood. Thank you very much. I'll jump back in the queue.\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nAll right. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Hanlon [Phonetic], who's a private investor.\nYour line is live.\nQ: Thank you for taking question. My concern is the rate of cash burn doesn't look like it's going\nto last more than six months or so, maybe you could just add a few?\nTranscript Provided by\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes, yes, for sure. Thanks for the question and thanks for being on the line here, Jim. Look, we\nare evaluating our cash position currently and looking at ways to improve that. Ultimately, our\nbusiness, we are in a situation where we are utilizing cash to run our operations. So, we definitely\nare focused on fixing that issue.\nQ: Fixing it in terms of getting some income in or further shareholder dilution?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nWell, we're definitely looking at additional revenue coming in through these various tests, large-\nscale demonstrations, and so forth, that's part of the equation. We're also evaluating both additional\ndebt and equity financing.\nQ: Any more you can add to that? I'm just concerned as a shareholder where the price is now and\nfurther dilution on a per share price?\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nI mean, at the end of the day, we'll need to raise additional capital and there's multiple sources for\nthat. So, our goal is to do to raise capital in the least dilutive way to our shareholders that makes\nsense for the long-term.\nQ: Thank you for taking my questions.\nChris Gannon - President and Chief Executive Officer, 374Water Inc.\nYes.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Over the past\nquarter, we have continued executing on our strategic initiatives taking major strides towards the\ncommercialization of our AirSCWO technology to capture the expansive and growing markets\nfor destruction of organic waste, estimated to exceed 250 billion globally. Our vision remains\nclear and executable, namely to deliver a scalable solution for organic waste destruction across\nmunicipal, federal, industrial and TSDF sectors.\nToday, we will discuss our technology and our major advancements towards commercialization,\nour recent deployment to Orlando, upcoming demonstrations, recent waste stream destruction\nsuccesses as well as the market opportunities we are pursuing, including near-term destruction-\nas-a-service revenue opportunities, our go-forward capital strategy and our growth strategy. As\nin prior calls, I will start with a discussion of our technology.\nWe believe our AirSCWO system sits at the forefront of clean tech innovation, offering a vital\nsolution to global wastewater treatment and organic waste destruction challenges. The core of\nour AirSCWO system is our patented supercritical water oxidation technology designed to\npermanently destroy and mineralize a broad spectrum of organic nonhazardous and hazardous\nwaste streams, producing safe, dischargeable clean water, safe mineral affluent, safe vent gas and\nrecoverable heat energy.\nImportantly, AirSCWO eliminates recalcitent, organic waste, including emerging contaminants\nlike PFAS in the SCWO process without creating waste byproducts. Our AirSCWO technology\nis designed to destroy organic contaminates across municipal, federal and industrial waste\nstreams. Traditional waste include biosolids, landfill leachate, oily sludge, home fractionate,\nmilitary waste, granular activated carbon, ion exchange resin and other organic industrial waste.\nWhile emerging contaminants include PFAS, like AFFF firefighting foam, pharmaceuticals,\npesticides and plastics. In addition to our AirSCWO system, our technology incorporates certain\npre- and post-treatment systems. These solutions ensure our AirSCWO system receives waste in\nthe right form for ease of processing and destruction. Three treatment systems consist of\nmasseraters and/or crushers, screens, mixing tanks, chemical feed and dewatering solutions;\nwhile post-treatment systems consist of clarifiers and filters.\nAs we encounter new forms of waste, the pre- and post-treatment processes will be adjusted\nand/or refined to accommodate the particulars of these waste streams. We plan to offer four\ncommercial scale AirSCWO models and corresponding pre- and post-treatment technologies to\nTranscript Provided by\nfully support our end customers' organic waste destruction needs. These AirSCWO models\nconsist of our AS1, AS6, AS30 and larger capacity systems like our AS100s and larger. Our\nhighly mobile AS1 unit is designed to process up to one metric ton per day of wet waste, and is\nideal for on-site demonstrations, cleanups and small-scale destruction-as-a-service or DAAS\nprojects.\nOur mobile AS6 unit is designed to process up to six metric tons per day of wet waste, and is\nideal for smaller municipal, federal and industrial sites. We plan to utilize this mobile unit for\nboth permanent on-site destruction and mobile DAAS opportunities. Our AS30 is designed to\nprocess up to 30 metric tons of wet waste per day and is semi-permanent. We believe this unit is\nideal for midsized municipal, federal and industrial sites as well as regional TSDFs and landfills.\nFinally, our largest bespoke AS100 systems will be designed to process 100 or more tons of wet\nwaste per day and will be permanent installations. We believe these systems will be well suited\nfor the largest municipal wastewater treatment facilities like the City of Orlando and Orange\nCounty as well as large industrial facilities, which process large volumes of waste daily.\nOver the past six months, we have made substantial improvements to our AirSCWO system,\nwhich has materially advanced our technology towards commercialization across multiple waste\nstreams. Our technology effectively processes solid waste, which can be preprocessed and\ndispersed for treatment, including wastewater sludges and biosolids, spent granular activated\ncarbon or GAC, ion-exchange resins and hard-to-degrade plastics and liquid waste such as\nfirefighting foam or AFFF, industrial solvents and [indiscernible] made streams.\nRecent system improvements include upgrades to our pretreatment systems, feedstock delivery\nto our reactor, water process controls, mixing geometry, and atmospheric monitoring, controls\nand automation systems, AirSCWO processing and post-treatment to name just a few of the\nsignificant improvements we have made to our system recently. These and other system\nupgrades contributed to our confidence in completing the commercial scale deployment to\nOrlando.\nThis deployment has allowed us to process biosolids at scale in a real-world wastewater\ntreatment facility environment as well as begin to execute on a range of waste destruction\ndemonstrations for clients and test additional liquid and solid waste streams at scale to prove our\nsystems capabilities across multiple organic waste streams. Through our technology\ndevelopment and testing processes, we have been working along parallel pass related to sludge\nand liquid waste. We are now pursuing near-term revenue opportunities across both waste\nstreams. I will discuss these revenue opportunities shortly.\nIn September, we announced a successful deployment, commissioning and full operability of our\nAirSCWO system which consists of our core AirSCWO technology and our biosolids dewatering\nunit at the City of Orlando's Iron Bridge Regional Water Reclamation facility, which offers us a\nreal world stage to demonstrate our system. The Orlando deployment marks a major milestone in\nour technology commercialization journey and affords us the opportunity to process not only\nbiosolids, but also other solid and liquid municipal, federal and industrial waste streams.\nTranscript Provided by\nIn fact, we are doing just that. We are executing various contracted demonstrations as well as our\nown internal commercial scale waste destruction projects to advance our technology to further\nunlock other key market verticals. I will provide further updates on our Orlando deployment and\nnext steps there in future calls.\nTurning now to our Orange County Sanitation or OC San for short. As previously disclosed, we\nare building an AirSCWO system for delivery to OC San in 2025. Prior to this deployment, we\nwill complete a factory acceptance test, and upon delivery, the system will undergo a six-month\noperational period managed by 374Water engineers, followed by another six-month operational\nperiod managed by OC San staff. We were pleased to host the team from OC San at the Orlando\nfacility in October to show them the system in a real-world environment and had a day of\nproductive conversations about our strategy and ongoing partnership.\nAs a reminder, following the successful demonstrations, the City of Orlando and OC San have\nannounced their intentions to upgrade to our larger AS30 system and have already secured\nrelevant funding. Following the AS30 installations, OC San also intends to purchase multiple\nAS100 or larger units to manage waste for their entire plants. The City of Orlando has expressed\na similar intent.\nNow let's turn to materials that contain per and polyfluoroalkyln substances or PFAS for short,\nwhich are synthetic chemicals known for their persistence in the environment, which caused\nadverse effects in humans and animals. We have been hard at work developing our technology to\neffectively destroy PFAS waste streams. This work has paid off as our technology has\nsuccessfully processed and destroyed a host of PFAS contaminated waste with the structural\nresults north of 99.99% and more.\nOne such PFAS contaminant is Aqueous Film-Forming Foam or AFFF firefighting foam.\nDeveloped by the U.S. Navy and 3M in the 1960s, AFFF is used to suppress Class B fires\ninvolving plantable liquids like gasoline, oil and jet fuel. Since that time, AFFF has been widely\nused in state and local fire departments, military bases, airports, refineries and chemical plants\nfor fire suppression.\nAFFF is highly persistent, leading to long-term contamination of soil and water resources.\nFurther, exposure to AFFF has been linked to various health issues, including cancers, immune\nsystem effects, birth defects and developmental challenges in children. Due to environmental and\nhealth concerns, several regulations have been enacted to limit or prohibit the use of AFFF. The\nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2020, mandated that the DoD phase out the\nuse of PFAS containing AFFF by October 2024.\nIn addition, various states have implemented bans or restrictions on AFFF use. For example,\nCalifornia prohibited the sale or distribution of AFFF-containing PFAS starting January 1, 2022,\nand banned its use for training purposes. Importantly, many states across the U.S. are also\nevaluating similar bans and are initiating programs that move towards destruction of their\nstockpiles of AFFF.\nTranscript Provided by\nWe have completed numerous internal AFFF destruction tests on our lab-scale system and\ncommercial scale AS1 and AS6 systems, which have demonstrated 99.999% plus AFFF\ndestruction results. These tests have also informed additional technological improvements to our\nAirSCWO system. Based on these successes and improvements, we now feel confident in\npursuing near-term AFFF destruction-as-a-service revenue opportunities within the local, state,\nfederal and industrial markets.\nWe are also advancing our development efforts to address GAC, IX and fomate destruction. So\nfar, we have experienced meaningful results and are currently focused on pretreatment process\nchanges to deliver these waste and easily process form to our AirSCWO technology. We intend\nto continue to expand our testing of these waste streams in response to changing regulations to\naddress PFAS in water and wastewater.\nGranular activated carbon or GAC for short, is used by various industries for its absorption\nproperties, including water treatment facilities, industry, pharmaceutical manufacturing, air\npurification systems, oil and gas and environmental remediation firms. GAC is used to absorb\ncontainments from liquids and gases. While GAC effectively removes contaminants, spent GAC\ncan become a hazardous waste if it absorbs toxic substances. Improper disposal of spent GAC\ncan lead to secondary environmental contamination.\nIon exchange resins or IX for short, our polymers used to remove ions from solutions, commonly\nemployed in water softening and purification processes. Over time, these resins become saturated\nwith contaminants are referred to as spent ion exchange resins. These resins are used in various\nindustries, including water treatment, chemical manufacturing, and nuclear power. Spent ion\nresins can become hazardous substances making their disposal a potential environmental concern\nas improper handling can lead to the release of toxic materials into the environment.\nFoam fractionation or foam frac of landfill leachate is a treatment process that concentrates\npollutants such as PFAS and various organic contaminants from liquid waste into a foamate,\nmaking them easy to manage. While SCWO destroys organic pollutants, any heavy metals that\nmay be present are not degraded. Instead, they are separated and captured in the stable non-\nreactive inert form, allowing for safe disposal or potential recovery and reuse.\nWe have achieved great success running GAC, IX, foamate and other industrial solvents and lab\nscale and AS1 commercial scale and have seen the destruction levels greater than 99.99%. In the\ncoming months, we will be running full destruction trials on our AS6 and anticipate similar\ndestruction results.\nNow turning to our lab operations. Based on our internal technology development and customer\nneeds, we moved our lab operations to a state-of-the-art Biosafety Level 1 laboratory in\nWorsville, North Carolina. This new facility more than triples our lab testing capacity, enabling\nfaster throughput and ability to handle more complex materials. We utilized this facility to\ncomplete initial lab-scale waste destruction tests for our customers to showcase the effectiveness\nof our AirSCWO technology in the supercritical water oxidation process to destroy organic\nwaste.\nTranscript Provided by\n374Water's Lab is often the first experience for customers to learn about the power of AirSCWO\nto destroy organic waste and provides a revenue source for the company. We also utilize our lab\nas an important part of our research, development, and engineering organization to develop\npretreatment protocols on waste streams, identify and evaluate potential challenges with\nprocessing various waste streams through our AirSCWO system and develop a robust approach\nto effectively processing in those waste streams.\nNow let's turn our attention to the waste treatment and destruction market. As a reminder, we\nestimate the global market opportunity for our AirSCWO waste destruction technology to be\nmeasured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. While the global market is truly massive, we\nconsciously made the decision to focus on cultivating the U.S. market at this time. With this in\nmind, we have a robust and growing municipal, federal, industrial and TSDF backlog and\npipeline of more than $1.8 billion.\nAs public awareness of emerging contaminants grows, traditional technologies focused on waste\nremoval such as land application, landfilling, incineration, deep well injection and hauling and\nstorage, which changed the market decades ago are now increasingly viewed as insufficient as\nthey only move the problem and liability from one median, one geography and one organization\nto another.\nWe believe our commercial scale AirSCWO system will offer a comprehensive and final\nsolution for the most challenging organic waste streams. From a cost perspective, we believe our\ntechnology is competitive with current waste removal alternatives when considering all accretive\ndegree of costs, including future liabilities. Further, recent legal settlements in federal\nremediation budgets indicate substantial financial obligations and funding associated with\naddressing existing and future liabilities.\nRecent EPA regulations, state mandates and the bipartisan concern over emerging contaminants\nensure stricter and more robust disposal practices and requirements will continue regardless of\nthe results of the recent election. These developments are accelerating the transition, which was\nalready well underway to emerging commercial scale destruction solutions like our AirSCWO\nsystem.\nWith this in mind, let's discuss the markets in which we participate. First, let's discuss the $120\nbillion U.S. drinking water and municipal wastewater management market, which includes\napproximately 152,000 water utilities, 16,000 wastewater treatment facilities, several thousand\ncapped and uncapped landfills and more than 52,000 state and local firefighting units. All of\nthese areas have waste streams, which must be managed, disposed of and/or destroyed.\nU.S. drinking water utilities are increasingly impacted by contaminants like PFAS, microplastics\nand pharmaceuticals, leading to widespread adoption of treatment methods like granular\nactivated carbon and ion exchange to filter these substances. As these materials become saturated\nwith PFAS, processes like supercritical water oxidation are essential for safely destroying the\nspent GAC and IX offering a more complete solution for PFAS disposal. We believe we are well\npositioned to provide a compelling solution here.\nTranscript Provided by\nU.S. municipal wastewater treatment market is experiencing significant challenges as it relates to\nthe management and disposal of biosolids, which are highly contaminated with PFAS,\nmicroplastics and other harmful substances. Traditional methods of biosolid disposal, including\nland application as fertilizer or soil supplements, landfill burial, incineration are simply not\nadequate.\nIn fact, the state of Florida's House Bill HB 1405 places stricter limits on sludge land application\ndue to nutrient pollution, particularly near sensitive water bodies, increasing demand for\nalternative sludge management. Note previously, Florida used land application as one of their\nprimary biosolids disposal methods. As a result of these recent changes, Florida municipalities\nnow transferred this additional biosolid waste out of state, extremely long distances to dispose of\nthem in landfills, which increases their costs dramatically. The regulatory landscape, including\nFlorida mandates, has created a perfect storm, which landfills increasingly closing their doors as\nbiosolids and are on the rise. Municipalities are urgently seeking solutions, and we are well\npositioned to deliver here.\nNow let's turn to landfills. There are over 3,000 landfills across the U.S. facing leachate issues,\nincluding nearly 1,700 open landfills and over 1,300 closed landfills. Landfill leachate is a liquid\nthat forms when water percolates through waste material in a landfill, picking up various\ndissolved and suspended substances. This contaminated liquid is a result of rainfall, surface\nrunoff and decomposing waste within the landfill, which can include organic materials,\nchemicals, heavy metals, pathogens as well as biosolids. We are in discussions with waste\nmanagement companies surrounding landfill leachate destruction demonstrations within the lab.\nWe anticipate these early demonstrations will translate into full-scale construction of service\nopportunities for our company shortly.\nNow let's discuss AFFF firefighting foam. Both scale, removal and disposal of PFAS-laden\nAFFF firefighting foam is now underway at the state and municipal government levels. 16 U.S.\nstates currently offer AFFF buyback programs to help fire departments safely dispose of this\ntoxic firefighting foam. These programs enable fire departments and agencies to return obsolete\nor unused AFFF stocks, which are then safely stored and processed for disposal.\nFunding for the destruction of collected AFFF varies by state. For example, Ohio's program run\nby the Ohio EPA and State Fire Marshal is funded by a settlement from a PCB-related case. In\ncontrast, North Carolina's take-back program leverages the state support and collaborates with\nthe North Carolina Collaboratory to research and apply PFAS destruction technologies. We are\nnow starting to bid on AFFF waste destruction opportunities using our AirSCWO destruction-as-\na-service model. We believe state and municipal AFFF destruction opportunities represent near-\nterm revenue opportunities for our company.\nAs of today, our municipal backlog and pipeline stands north of $600 million. Now the $15\nbillion U.S. federal waste management market, which includes 715 DoD sites, 50 DOE sites and\n150 airports under the oversight of the FAA. These agencies have stockpiles of waste streams\nsuch as AFFF firefighting foam, chemicals, narcotics, biosolids and other waste, which must be\ntreated, stored and destroyed. These agencies are actively seeking solutions to eliminate this\nPFAS contamination\nTranscript Provided by\nThe DoD estimates cleanup costs of over $29 billion for PFAS contamination. Full-scale\nremoval and disposal of PFAS contained firefighting equipment and a AFFF firefighting foam is\nnow underway in military basis around the country. Hundreds of millions of dollars are already\nbeing allocated to eliminate AFFF from all U.S. military facilities. Federal funding for this\ncleanup activity is available and growing. We see a very real market opportunity here. As such,\nwe intend to bid on AFFF destruction opportunities using our AirSCWO destruction destruction-\nas-a-service model. We believe federal government atrial disruption opportunities represent a\nvery real near-term revenue opportunity for our company, and we intend to capitalize.\nWe also see growing demand for destruction of PFAS contaminated media, such as granular\nactivated carbon and ion exchange waste streams using the cleanup of soil at DoD facilities.\nOver time, we expect to broaden our focus to include GAC and IX waste destruction, leveraging\nthe billions of dollars of federal funding earmarked to support destruction and cleanup efforts.\nFurther and importantly, we anticipate continued strong bipartisan political support for PFAS\nremediation and destruction will remain with the DoD as they continue to spearhead federal\naction.\n374Waters contractually engaged into 2025 with multiple DoD entities for evaluating PFAS and\nother organic waste stream destruction effectiveness. As of today, our federal backlog and\npipeline exceeds $900 million. Now for the $80 billion U.S. industrial waste management\nmarket, which includes a diverse group of industries from landfills and oil and gas to health care\nand battery manufacturing verticals.\nAs a reminder, industrial facilities generate tons and tons of organic waste annually, that are\neither pretreated on-site and discharged to wastewater treatment plants, treated and discharged\ndirectly into our water bodies or transported offsite for expensive treatment and disposal of final\nresiduals. Downstream handlers and disposal facilities are now beginning to reject waste material\nbecause of the increasing threat of liability and remediation costs.\nWe continue to experience traction across the industrial market, targeting subverticals like oil\nand gas, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and battery manufacturing. We have and we will continue\nto provide waste destruction tests to industrial market participants to demonstrate AirSCWO's\nefficacy in destroying and eliminating liability associated with their persistent organic waste\nstreams.\nI will now walk through each of these markets. The oil and gas industry generates significant\nvolumes of nonhazardous and hazardous waste, including drill cuttings, produced water and\nsludge, all of which require a specialized treatment. U.S. oil and gas waste treatment market is\nvalued at roughly $10.5 billion in 2024, and is expected to grow, driven by regulatory pressures\nand a focus on environmental responsibility. In addition, the oil and gas market has significant\nstockpiles of AFFF firefighting foam, which again represents an important near-term destruction-\nas-a-service revenue opportunity for our company.\nThe U.S. battery recycling market value north of $500 million in 2024 is expected to grow\nrapidly, driven by the increased demand for electric vehicles and the need for sustainable battery\nTranscript Provided by\ndisposal methods. With a projected CAGR of 38% through 2030, this expanding market\nrepresents a significant opportunity for AirSCWO. Key industry players recognize potential to\nserve as a central waste management solution, providing safe and sustainable processing while\nhelping battery recyclers meet environmental regulations. The technology application within\nbattery recycling highlights its role in advancing sustainability within hazardous waste\nmanagement.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is facing increasing regulatory scrutiny and environmental\ndemands, driving the need for effective sustainable waste treatment solutions. Valued at north of\n$600 million in 2024, U.S. pharmaceutical waste management market is projected to grow as the\nindustry emphasize responsible disposal practices. SCWO is particularly well suited for this\nmarket given its ability to break down complex and high-risk compounds effectively.\nPharmaceutical manufacturers are actively seeking AirSCWO as a solution to handle diverse\nwaste profiles with minimal environmental impact, positioning the technology is essential for the\nsector's compliance and sustainability goals. The chemical manufacturing sector accounts for\nroughly 50% of the industrial waste market, which translates into roughly 15 billion pounds of\nproduced waste annually, and the annual industrial waste market from chemical production is\nvalued at over $1 billion.\nChemical waste can be in solid, liquid or sludge form generated by chemical production,\nmanufacturing and other industrial activities. Many chemicals can be hazardous, toxic or\ncarcinogenic substances and can be in the form of synthetic organics, organic solvents, oils,\nplasticizers and the like. Industrial players are increasingly turning to sustainable solutions not\nonly due to regulatory requirements and public pressures, but because the use of recovery\ntechnologies like 374Water's AirSCWO system can save costs, streamline internal operations\nand eliminate potential liabilities.\nWe currently see no effective commercial scale final and permanent destruction solution for\nthese industrial markets. We see a mix of capital sale and destruction-as-a-service opportunities\nacross the industrial market landscape, which will benefit our business. As of today, our\nindustrial backlog and pipeline exceeds $300 million.\nFinally, the U.S. treatment, storage and disposal facility or TSDF market, which includes more\nthan 860 RCRA operating permitted sites in the U.S. We are actively engaged with global and\nnational materials, waste handling and waste management companies to set up a national\nnetwork of facilities to service customers from our three core markets: municipal, federal and\nindustrial, and provide a turnkey destruction-as-a-service or DAAS offering, which will drive\nrecurring revenues.\nAs such, we are seeking to partner with the existing TSDFs who are known to our customers,\nhave experienced in the nonhazardous, in hazardous waste treatment spaces and finally have the\nappropriate local, state and federal permits. We will provide further updates as we sign these\nstrategic and innovative partnerships that will drive recurring revenues and solve multi-\nstakeholder market problems. We believe the TSDF DAAS market opportunity is measured in\nthe hundreds of millions of dollars to our company.\nTranscript Provided by\nNow let's shift to how we sell our technology. As discussed previously, we offer three AirSCWO\nprocurement close to our customers: capital purchase, lease and destruction-as-a-service or\nDAAS. Large municipalities typically desire to outright purchase the equipment within their\nfacilities. So there may be some instances where these large municipalities opt for our DAAS\nmodel. Smaller municipalities, landfill operators and many industrial clients are drawn to our\nDAAS model which provides access to our waste destruction technology without significant\nupfront investment.\nFederal government customers, including the military have also consistently articulated desire\nfor our DAAS model, with centralized destruction facilities as well as run-type structures to\nfacilitate on-site destruction. Finally, TSDF market participants have been focused on our DAAS\nmodel and waste destruction and revenue sharing. While we are in the early stages of making\nthese agreements, we are increasingly bullish on these opportunities to generate meaningful\nrevenue. We will naturally keep you informed as our procurement vehicles in our discussions of\nthese market verticals evolve.\nNow let's turn to how we fund all of these opportunities. As previously disclosed, we are actively\nraising capital to expand our company, and we'll be providing public disclosures on our progress\nhere shortly. As mentioned previously, we have a backlog and pipeline of $1.8 billion in near-\nterm capital sale and destruction-as-a-service revenue opportunities, which require capital to\nexecute.\nIn addition, we have discussed the need to expand our team to more rapidly commercialize our\nAirSCWO technology across several waste streams, including biosolids, AFFF firefighting foam,\nlandfill leachate and other PFAS contaminated liquids as well as build, sell and deploy our\ntechnology across these markets. First, we plan to expand our engineering, feel and\nmanufacturing teams to fast-track technology commercialization and deployment.\nWe are focused on advancing engineering efforts through parallel development paths to identify\nand resolve potential failure modes, ensuring the technology's resilience. At the same time, the\ncompany intends to deploy field teams to conduct demonstrations across various market\nsegments to gather critical data and validate the technology as well as begin to execute on DAAS\nrevenue opportunities, particularly within the AFFF destruction market.\nSecond, we plan to make key strategic hires. We are currently meeting with accomplished Chief\nTechnology Officer candidates with deep, proven backgrounds in technology development,\ncommercialization and deployment, and we intend to announce our new CTO shortly. The CTO\nis an important hire as we scale our engineering organization to effectively execute our\ndevelopment, commercialization and technology deployment goals.\nThird, we intend to establish a dedicated manufacturing and engineering facility that will\nenhance production capacity, improved quality control and support ongoing innovation as the\ncompany scales to meet growing market demands. Fourth, we are actively building two AS1\nunits which are hypermobile for on-site demonstrations and destructions, including near-term\nrevenue-generating AFFF DAAS work. In addition, we are constructing multiple AS6 units, one\nTranscript Provided by\nto deploy to Orange County Sanitation in 2025, another to potentially deploy to a TSDF partner,\nand one, to begin generating AFFF DAAS revenue.\nFinally, we are in the process of creating an independent industry advisory board consisting of\nexperts with critical connections and expertise across our municipal, federal, industrial and\nTSDF market verticals. This advisory board will support leadership and the Board of Directors to\nstrategically and quickly explore and unlock new market opportunities, which will enable us to\nmore rapidly scale our business.\nIn summary, 374Water's AirSCWO technology is tackling some of the world's most critical\nwaste challenges with a solution that is both unmatched in its commercial efficacy and scale. We\nhave made substantial progress on the path to commercialize our technology across both solid\nand liquid waste streams. We continue to build a robust backlog and pipeline of actionable\nopportunities which now totals more than $1.8 billion.\nIn addition, we are pursuing near-term revenue opportunities across our AirSCWO capital sales,\nemerging destruction-as-a-service business model destruction demonstrations and our lab tests.\nThe progress we've made over the past six months is significant, and I am confident in our ability\nto continue driving value for our shareholders.\nThank you for your support and interest, and we look forward to sharing more updates in the\ncoming months.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Adrienne to update you on our financials.\nAdrienne Anderson - CFO, 374Water, Inc.\nThank you, Chris. Today, I'll discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2024, which\nreflects our business evolution as we began scaling our business and enhancing our financial\nposition. I'll touch on a few key metrics for the first three quarters of 2024.\nFor the nine months of 2024, the company generated revenue of $434,000 compared to\napproximately $864,000 for the nine months of 2023. As we start to reach the end of the\nassembly and fabrication work on our sold unit, our direct cost decline, which has resulted in a\nreduction of our equipment revenues of approximately $527,000, offset by an increase in our\nservice revenues from our treatability studies of approximately $97,000.\nFurther, during the quarter, we deployed our owned AirSCWO unit to the City of Orlando for the\nwaste destruction demonstrations previously discussed. We anticipate recognizing revenue from\nthis deployment as we complete these demonstrations during Q4 2024.\nTotal operating expenses increased from $5.2 million in the first nine months of 2023 to $7.8\nmillion in the first nine months of 2024, driven primarily by an increase in our general and\nadministrative expenses of approximately $730,000, an increase in our professional fees of\napproximately $1.58 million and an increase in research and development expenses of $581,000.\nTranscript Provided by\nIncreases in general and administrative expenses stem from the continued efforts to build out and\nestablish our executive team as well as the relocation of our manufacturing facility and continued\ncommercialization and growth efforts. Increase in our professional fees are primarily non-\nrecurring expenses related to the settlement of a legal matter and the changes in our executive\nleadership and Board of Directors that have been previously disclosed. The increase in our\nresearch and development expenses is primarily due to an increase in engineering expenses and\nour continued efforts to commercialize our systems.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have a working capital of $4.5 million and no outstanding debt\nobligations.\nWith that, I will turn the call back over to Chris.\nChris Gannon - President & CEO, 374Water, Inc.\nThank you, Adrienne. We would now like to move to Q&A.\nOperator\nCertainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator\nInstructions]. Your first question for today is from Graham Price with Raymond James.\nQ: Hi, thanks for taking the question. For my first one, I just wanted to ask one on the regulatory\nlandscape, given the election. So if the Trump administration curtails the EPA's ability to\nregulate PFAS. Just wondering how you would think about that? Would that create a scenario of\nkind of state-by-state hodgepodge for PFAS rules? Or how would you see that playing out?\nChris Gannon - President & CEO, 374Water, Inc.\nWell, Graham, I appreciate the question. When I think about that, I really feel like the train has\nleft the station. There are so many different lawsuits and other things going on, big awards and\nso forth geared towards dealing with this issue. It's in the news, gosh, every day now as well\nabout the issue. So while that may occur, they may delay or push out the full implementation. I\ndon't think that's going to have a material impact on the opportunity set that we have in front of\nus.\nQ: Got it. Thank you for that. Maybe for my follow-up, kind of along the same lines? Any\nchanges do you see in your work with the DoD under new leadership?\nChris Gannon - President & CEO, 374Water, Inc.\nNo, not at this time. We're in obviously constant contact with them. We have a host of different\nfederal government demonstrations, and we're not hearing anything from them about worry that\nthose are going to get delayed. When you think about the military branches and all of the various\nfacilities that are highly contaminated, the military is very focused on cleaning up where they\nlive. And so again, I don't see that materially changing for us or other participants in the industry.\nTranscript Provided by\nQ: Got it. Understood. Thank you very much. I'll jump back in the queue.\nChris Gannon - President & CEO, 374Water, Inc.\nThank you so much.\nOperator\nYour next question for today is from Justin Smith with Maxim Group.\nQ: Hi, good afternoon. Yes, so my question was just if you guys could please give a little more\ndetail on maybe the logistics and the operations at the Orlando facility kind of what type of\ntesting are you guys doing exactly? Is it the percentage of PFAS that the AirSCWO systems can\nremove? And then are those customer demonstrations currently going on right now at the\nfacility? And if so, maybe what are some of the most important metrics that the customers are\nlooking at during these demonstrations? Thank you.\nChris Gannon - President & CEO, 374Water, Inc.\nJustin, thanks for the question, and thanks for being on the call here today. So in terms of the\nCity of Orlando, we are fully up and running there. We have conducted some demonstrations for\ncustomers on site there. But right now, we are focused on processing biosolids to meet that\nagreement with the City of Orlando as well.\nAs far as what people are looking at, they're looking at a lot of different items as they evaluate\nthe efficacy of our technology. One is that it's a continuous flow system that its operating very\nstably, and it is processing waste as we promised. The other is they are looking at not only what\nthat waste stream is as it goes into our system, but what's coming out, and they are taking\nsamples, extensive samples throughout the processing period to send off to labs they're choosing\nto, again, be very focused on the destruction of the various waste streams.\nCertainly, everyone is looking at PFAS within those waste streams and evaluating the efficacy of\nour destruction of long and short chain PFAS. As a reminder, when you destroy long chain\nPFAS, it often turns to short chain PFAS, and the short chain PFAS is incredibly difficult to\ndestroy. Our system is able to be tuned to, and have the resonance time or the length that that\nwaste stream is within our reactor. And we have seen incredible results in terms of the complete\ndestruction of PFAS at a very, very, very high percentage.\nQ: All right. Great. That was all very helpful. Appreciate it. And then just for a quick follow-up.\nRegarding the unit for Orange County sanitation, how long is that factor expected to take before\nthat unit can be shipped?\nChris Gannon - President & CEO, 374Water, Inc.\nTranscript Provided by\nYes. So that's basically a day test and then based on those results. And we will, of course, have to\nperform that test down in Orlando, which is where we're building the unit, and then we would\nship it out.\nQ: Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll hop back in the queue. Appreciate it.\nChris Gannon - President & CEO, 374Water, Inc.\nThanks so much, Justin.\nOperator\nWe have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to\nChris for closing remarks.\nChris Gannon - President & CEO, 374Water, Inc.\nWell, thank you everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to talking more in the near\nfuture. Also, please look for updates as we have additional press releases and different papers\ncoming out as well over the near term. Very exciting time for our business, a lot going on, and\nwe, again, look forward to engaging with you in the future. Bye for now.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you\nfor your participation.\nTranscript Provided by"
