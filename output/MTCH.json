On a trade date basis.\n2. Operating Income in Q3’24 includes $37 million of impairments of intangible assets and other charges 2\nrelated to the shutdown of Hakuna and other of our live streaming services.\nDear Shareholders,\nMatch Group delivered Total Revenue consistent with our outlook and Adjusted Operating Income\n(“AOI”) that exceeded our expectations in the third quarter.\nIn Q3, Tinder Payer trends improved on a year-over-year basis (“Y/Y”), declining 4% Y/Y versus down\n8% Y/Y in Q2, and on a sequential basis, with 311,000 sequential Payer additions. Tinder Direct\nRevenue was slightly below our expectations, driven by modestly lower RPP. Tinder monthly\nactive users (“MAU”) remained down 9% Y/Y and we opted to delay à la carte (“ALC”) initiatives\nfor further iteration as they were impacting subscription revenue more than we had anticipated,\nwhich we expect will have some downstream impacts in Q4.\nWe remain encouraged by Tinder’s progress on product initiatives to transform the brand. We\nexpect to see tangible markers of improvement as Tinder’s new features roll out over the coming\nquarters.\nHinge Direct Revenue grew 36% Y/Y and reached an all-time high in downloads in the quarter. It was\nthe second most downloaded3 dating app in aggregate across its English-speaking and European\nexpansion markets, where it widened its lead over its next largest competitor throughout the\nquarter. In October, Hinge leap-frogged to become the second most downloaded dating app in\nthe U.S. for the first time ever, took the number one spot in France, and further strengthened its\nnumber one position in several other markets.\nAt Match Group Asia (“MG Asia”), live video chat app Azar has solid momentum in Europe, and U.S.\nexpansion is underway. In the Japanese dating market, we’re seeing signs of stabilization in user\ntrends. At Evergreen and Emerging (“E&E”), consolidation efforts are progressing as planned, with\nBLK and Chispa fully migrated to the shared platform in the quarter, and the Emerging brands\ncontinue to grow and present opportunities for further expansion.\nThroughout 2024, we’ve taken meaningful steps to put the portfolio on better financial footing,\nincluding exiting Hakuna and other of our live streaming services, and making progress on our\nconsolidation efforts at E&E. These actions are helping to drive improved margins and cash flow.\nWe’re focused on appropriately managing the differing growth stages of our brands, leveraging\nthe strength of our category-leading portfolio, and driving efficiencies. Simultaneously, we remain\ncommitted to our innovation efforts, including AI-driven initiatives, which we believe will improve\nthe user experience, accelerate growth at our existing brands, and may support the launch of\nexciting new brands as well.\nWe look forward to sharing more on our long-term plans, product roadmaps, and strategies to\ndrive shareholder value at our Investor Day on December 11, 2024.\n.\nBernard Kim (\"BK\") Gary Swidler\nChief Executive Officer President &\nChief Financial Officer\n3.

Among all\ndating apps, as defined by Match Group.\n3\nQ3 2024 Business Unit Financial Results\nBeginning this quarter, we will present our business units as four operating segments: Tinder®,\nHinge®, MG Asia, and E&E. Providing greater detail about these business units offers better\ninsight into the company’s overall performance. As a result of these changes, we will no\nlonger report revenue by geography because we believe it is less relevant to understanding\nthe drivers of our performance.\n4\nBusiness Unit Updates\nTinder: Continued Evolution of Product and Brand Story\nIn Q3, Tinder Direct Revenue was $503 million, down 1% (up 1% FXN) from the prior year\nquarter. Tinder Payers declined 4% Y/Y in Q3, an improvement from an 8% Y/Y decline in Q2,\nand sequential net additions were 311,000, the most since Q3 2022. RPP was up 4% Y/Y to\n$16.87.\nTinder began testing several ALC initiatives in Q3, including Passport ALC, Likes You ALC,\nand a new feature called First Impressions. These initiatives were well received by users but\nmore cannibalistic to subscription revenue than expected and will require further iteration\nand testing before being fully rolled out. While this had only a modest impact on Q3 Direct\nRevenue, we do expect a more significant revenue impact in Q4.\nTinder MAU was down 9% Y/Y in Q3, which was the same rate of decline as in Q2, falling\nshort of our expectations for continued improvement in Y/Y trends. From mid-September\nthrough October, we saw more pressure on new users (registrations and reactivations) than\nwe expected, which has led to pressure on MAU.\nTinder’s primary focus remains driving its product transformation efforts forward to\nimprove ecosystem health and user outcomes, which we believe are necessary for durable\nimprovements in user, Payer, and revenue trends.\nTesting features to improve Tinder’s ecosystem. In Q3, Tinder\nbegan testing mandating face photos on a user's profile\nin several markets. This requirement prevents a user from\nsending likes without uploading a face photo. Initial tests have\nbeen positive. Tinder also began testing, in a small market,\ntechnology that further helps verify the authenticity of a\nprofile, another critical step toward improving the perception\nof realness on the platform. Tinder is carefully assessing the\nimpacts of these two features on the ecosystem and user\nexperience before launching more broadly.\nImproving user outcomes, especially for women. In August,\nTinder began testing a new feature called Spotlight Drops,\nwhich highlights a set of profiles with common interests. Tinder also recently started testing\na revamped Explore tab which includes new tiles that allow users to find others with similar\ninterests and intents, leading to better engagement trends. We believe Spotlight Drops and\nthe new Explore tab are foundational steps toward improving user outcomes, especially for\nwomen, and creating a more dynamic discovery experience.\n5\nEfforts targeting college-aged users and improving brand perception. Tinder returned\nto college campuses in September with updates to Tinder U, including simplified\nonboarding, college-specific profile elements, and student pricing. These product initiatives,\ncomplemented by robust marketing, helped drive the highest ever single day enrollment\nsince Tinder U launched five years ago.\nTinder also introduced its fourth College Swipe Off, a nationwide contest for college students.\nThe college with the highest Swipe® activity, Temple University, will receive a free on-campus\nconcert featuring Grammy-nominated artists Gunna and GloRilla. Across ambassador\nschools, College Swipe Off garnered approximately 52 million Swipes.\nTinder’s ongoing global It Starts with a Swipe™ campaign continues to drive improvements\nin users’ perception of Tinder’s “hookup stigma”4, which has improved 7 points in the U.S.\nfrom March 2023 to September 2024.\n4. Source: Internal Tinder survey of U.S. market.\n6\nHinge: Clear User Momentum and Rapidly Growing Revenue\nHinge achieved exceptional results in the quarter, with 36% Y/Y Direct Revenue growth driven\nby 21% Payer, 12% RPP, and 20% MAU growth Y/Y. Hinge continues to drive extraordinary user\nmomentum in both core English-speaking and European expansion markets.\nIn Q3, Hinge’s global downloads reached an all-time high, ranking it as the second most\ndownloaded5 dating app in aggregate across its core English-speaking and European\nexpansion markets. Hinge’s share of downloads widened throughout the quarter in the\nEuropean markets compared to the next most-downloaded app. Downloads increased by\nmore than 20% Y/Y across the Nordic and DACH regions, and more than 40% in France in\nSeptember.\nRemaining true to its brand narrative as the app that’s Designed to be Deleted® Hinge\nlaunched Your Turn Limits globally in September. The feature directly combats ghosting—a\nknown user pain point—by increasing a user’s focus on current matches, and ultimately\nhelps get users out on great dates faster. Tests of Your Turn Limits showed a ~20% increase\nin user responsiveness to their matches.\nHinge also launched two new marketing campaigns in August, including No Ordinary Love,\na digital and printed anthology of six real, authentic, and unfiltered Hinge dating journeys in\nthe U.S. and UK; and “The Moment I Knew” across European markets, which celebrates the\n‘aha’ moments when Hinge daters knew they’ve met their person on the app.\n5.

MAU based on internal data.\n7\nMG Asia: Azar® Expansion Continues; User Stability in Japan\nIn Q3, MG Asia Direct Revenue declined 6% Y/Y (down 1% FXN). Excluding Hakuna from the\nprior year quarter, MG Asia Direct Revenue declined 2% Y/Y.\nAzar’s personalized AI technology, which provides\nusers with a safer community-based video chat\nenvironment, is clearly resonating. Total MAU rose\n14% Y/Y globally in Q3. Similarly, Azar’s expansion\ninto Europe continues to be well-received, with\nMAU growing 27% Y/Y across the region. In\nOctober, Azar began its initial push into the U.S.\nWe believe Azar can attract users, especially Gen\nZ, looking for a more spontaneous and casual\nexperience.\nAt Pairs™, ongoing marketing initiatives and\nproduct refinements have led to stabilizing user\ntrends, including 4% Y/Y growth in Q3 downloads6. This positive trend is reflective of Japanese\ndating market trends overall, where downloads across the category reached their highest\nlevel since late 2022.\nE&E: Stabilizing Revenue and Achieving Consolidation Milestones\nIn Q3, E&E Direct Revenue declined 9% Y/Y, driven by a 14% Y/Y decline in Evergreen brands’\nDirect Revenue, partially offset by a 14% Y/Y increase in Emerging brands’ Direct Revenue.\nExcluding our live streaming services, E&E Direct Revenue was down 4% Y/Y.\n6.

Combined downloads across Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\nIncludes all dating apps in the online dating category in Japan as defined by Match Group.\n8\nThe Evergreen brands consist of longstanding\nbrands, including Match®, Meetic®, Plenty of\nFish®, and OkCupid®, that maintain meaningful\nuser bases and revenue, with improving\nprofitability as a result of recent consolidation\nefforts. Our Emerging brands consist of\nbrands tailored for specific demographic\ngroups, including Latinx singles (Chispa™),\nBlack singles (BLK®), gay men (Archer®),\nMuslims (Salams®), Christians (Upward®) and\nEast Asians (Yuzu™). We can offer all these\ndemographically tailored brands because\nthey leverage a common platform and team,\nenabling us to serve specific groups well and cost effectively. Over the coming years, we expect\nto fill in our portfolio to serve other demographic groups who are currently underserved by\nour existing Emerging brands. Collectively, our Emerging Brands reached three million MAU\nin Q3 from zero in 2018 when we began to incubate these brands.\nEfforts to eliminate redundancies and consolidate platforms at E&E are ongoing, with the\nsuccessful migration of BLK and Chispa to the new combined E&E platform completed\nin Q3. E&E’s platform consolidation efforts are expected to lead to substantial operational\nefficiency improvements and cost savings, which we continue to expect to realize partially in\n2025 and fully in 2026. The operational efficiencies include dramatically improving time-to-\nmarket for product features and enhanced user experiences by enabling each E&E brand to\noffer the best-in-class features from across the E&E portfolio.\n7.

U.S. only.\n9\nFinancial Outlook\nQ4 2024\nFor Q4, we expect Match Group Total Revenue of $865 million to $875 million, essentially flat\nY/Y. When excluding revenue from the now-exited Hakuna and other of our live streaming\nservices from the prior year quarter, we expect Match Group Total Revenue to be up 2% to\n3% Y/Y.\nFor Tinder, we expect Direct Revenue of $480 to $485 million, down 2% to 3% Y/Y, given the\nMAU headwinds and ALC initiative delays. We expect mid-single-digit Y/Y declines in Payers,\npartially offset by modest improvements in RPP.\nAcross our other brands, we expect Direct Revenue to be $370 to $375 million, representing 3%\nto 5% Y/Y growth. Within our other brands, we expect Hinge Direct Revenue of approximately\n$145 million, representing ~25% Y/Y growth. We expect Indirect Revenue to be approximately\n$15 million in the quarter.\nWe expect Q4 Match Group AOI to be $335 to $340 million, including approximately $7\nmillion in employee severance and similar charges and the Canada Digital Services Tax. We\nexpect AOI to be down 6% to 7% Y/Y, but up 4% to 6% Y/Y excluding the $40 million escrow\nrefund as a result of the settlement of the Google litigation in Q4’23. We expect Q4 Match\nGroup AOI margin of 39% at the midpoints of the ranges.\n10\nConference Call\nMatch Group will audiocast a conference call to answer questions regarding its third\nquarter financial results on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Securities\nMatch Group has various tranches of dilutive securities. The table below details these securities and their\npotentially dilutive impact (shares in millions; rounding differences may occur).\nAverage Exercise\nPrice 11/1/2024\nShare Price $35.69\nAbsolute Shares 251.1\nEquity Awards\nOptions $17.95 1.2\nRSUs and subsidiary denominated equity awards 15.1\nTotal Dilution - Equity Awards 16.3\nOutstanding Warrants\nWarrants expiring on September 15, 2026 (6.6 million outstanding) $134.76 —\nWarrants expiring on April 15, 2030 (6.8 million outstanding) $134.82 —\nTotal Dilution - Outstanding Warrants —\nTotal Dilution 16.3\n% Dilution 6.1%\nTotal Diluted Shares Outstanding 267.4\nThe dilutive securities presentation above is calculated using the methods and assumptions described below; these are\ndifferent from GAAP dilution, which is calculated based on the treasury stock method.\nOptions — The table above assumes the option exercise price is used to repurchase Match Group shares.\nRSUs and subsidiary denominated equity awards — The table above assumes RSUs are fully dilutive. All performance-\nbased and market-based awards reflect the expected shares that will vest based on current performance or market\nestimates. The table assumes no change in the fair value estimate of the subsidiary denominated equity awards from the\nvalues used for GAAP purposes at September 30, 2024.\nExchangeable Senior Notes — The Company has two series of Exchangeable Senior Notes outstanding. In the event of an\nexchange, each series of Exchangeable Senior Notes can be settled in cash, shares, or a combination of cash and shares.\nAt the time of each Exchangeable Senior Notes issuance, the Company purchased call options with a strike price equal to\nthe exchange price of each series of Exchangeable Senior Notes (“Note Hedge”), which can be used to offset the dilution\nof each series of the Exchangeable Senior Notes. No dilution is reflected in the table above for any of the Exchangeable\nSenior Notes because it is the Company’s intention to settle the Exchangeable Senior Notes with cash equal to the face\namount of the notes; any shares issued would be offset by shares received upon exercise of the Note Hedge.\nWarrants — At the time of the issuance of each series of Exchangeable Senior Notes, the Company also sold warrants\nfor the number of shares with the strike prices reflected in the table above. The cash generated from the exercise of the\nwarrants is assumed to be used to repurchase Match Group shares and the resulting net dilution, if any, is reflected in the\ntable above.\n24\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nMatch Group reports Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, Free Cash Flow, and Revenue Excluding Foreign\nExchange Effects, all of which are supplemental measures to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Adjusted\nOperating Income, Adjusted Operating Income Margin, and Free Cash Flow measures are among the primary metrics by which we\nevaluate the performance of our business, on which our internal budget is based and by which management is compensated. Revenue\nExcluding Foreign Exchange Effects provides a comparable framework for assessing the performance of our business without the effect\nof exchange rate differences when compared to prior periods. We believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools\nthat we use in analyzing our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Match Group endeavors to compensate for the\nlimitations of the non-GAAP measures presented by providing the comparable GAAP measures and descriptions of the reconciling\nitems, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measures. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling\nadjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures, which we describe below. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results that may be expected for a full year.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and\n(3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if\napplicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements, as applicable.\nWe believe Adjusted Operating Income is useful to analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison\nbetween our performance and that of our competitors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted Operating Income measure\nbecause they are non-cash in nature. Adjusted Operating Income has certain limitations because it excludes certain expenses.\nAdjusted Operating Income Margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income divided by revenues. We believe Adjusted Operating\nIncome Margin is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance\nand that of our competitors. Adjusted Operating Income margin has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact\nto our consolidated statement of operations of certain expenses.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is useful\nto investors because it represents the cash that our operating businesses generate, before taking into account non-operational cash\nmovements. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for\nthe period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate\nFree Cash Flow along with our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nWe look at Free Cash Flow as a measure of the strength and performance of our businesses, not for valuation purposes. In our view,\napplying “multiples” to Free Cash Flow is inappropriate because it is subject to timing, seasonality and one-time events. We manage\nour business for cash, and we think it is of utmost importance to maximize cash – but our primary valuation metric is Adjusted\nOperating Income.\nRevenue Excluding Foreign Exchange Effects is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates. The\npercentage change in Revenue Excluding Foreign Exchange Effects is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues\nover prior period revenues where current period revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates. We believe the impact\nof foreign exchange rates on Match Group, due to its global reach, may be an important factor in understanding period over period\ncomparisons if movement in rates is significant. Since our results are reported in U.S. dollars, international revenues are favorably\nimpacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to\nother currencies. We believe the presentation of revenue excluding foreign exchange effects in addition to reported revenue helps\nimprove the ability to understand Match Group’s performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not\nindicative of Match Group’s core operating results.\n25\nNon-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Our Non-GAAP Measures\nStock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options, RSUs, performance-\nbased RSUs and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted\nshares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only\nto the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of\nthe contingency period). To the extent stock-based awards are settled on a net basis, we remit the required tax-withholding amounts\nfrom our current funds.\nDepreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate\nthe cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term,\nif shorter.\nAmortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to\nacquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer\nlists, trade names and technology, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to (i) acquired indefinite-\nlived intangible assets, which consist of trade names and trademarks, and (ii) goodwill, which are not subject to amortization. An\nimpairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. We believe that intangible\nassets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment\ncharges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\nAdditional Definitions\nMatch Group Asia (“MG Asia”) primarily consists of the brands Pairs and Azar.\nEvergreen & Emerging (“E&E”) consists primarily of the brands Match, Meetic, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, and a number of demographically\nfocused brands.\nDirect Revenue is revenue that is received directly from end users of our services and includes both subscription and à la carte revenue.\nIndirect Revenue is revenue that is not received directly from end users of our services, substantially all of which is advertising revenue.\nPayers are unique users at a brand level in a given month from whom we earned Direct Revenue. When presented as a quarter-to-date\nor year-to-date value, Payers represents the average of the monthly values for the respective period presented. At a consolidated level\nand a business unit level to the extent a business unit consists of multiple brands, duplicate Payers may exist when we earn revenue\nfrom the same individual at multiple brands in a given month, as we are unable to identify unique individuals across brands in the\nMatch Group portfolio.\nRevenue Per Payer (“RPP”) is the average monthly revenue earned from a Payer and is Direct Revenue for a period divided by the\nPayers in the period, further divided by the number of months in the period.\nMonthly Active User (“MAU”) is a unique registered user at a brand level who has visited the brand’s app or, if applicable, their website\nin the last 28 days as of the measurement date. At a consolidated level, duplicate users will exist within MAU when the same individual\nvisits multiple brands in a given month.\nLeverage on a gross basis is calculated as principal debt balance divided by Adjusted Operating Income for the period referenced.\nLeverage on a net basis is calculated as principal debt balance less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments divided by\nAdjusted Operating Income for the period referenced.\n26\nOther Information\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis letter and our conference call, which will be held at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on November 7, 2024, may contain “forward-looking\nstatements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Through our trusted brands, we provide tailored services to meet the varying preferences of our users. Our\nservices are available in over 40 languages to our users all over the world.\nAs used herein, “Match Group,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us,” and similar terms refer to Match Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context\nindicates otherwise.\nBasis of Presenta\u0000on and Consolida\u0000on\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accoun\u0000ng principles (“GAAP”). The\nconsolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, all en\u0000\u0000es that are wholly-owned by the Company and all en\u0000\u0000es in which the\nCompany has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transac\u0000ons and accounts have been eliminated.\nIn management’s opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated\nfinancial statements and reflect, in management’s opinion, all adjustments, consis\u0000ng of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair\npresenta\u0000on of our consolidated financial posi\u0000on, consolidated results of opera\u0000ons and consolidated cash flows for the periods presented. Interim results\nare not necessarily indica\u0000ve of the results that may be expected for the full year. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be\nread in conjunc\u0000on with the consolidated statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAccoun\u0000ng Es\u0000mates\nManagement of the Company is required to make certain es\u0000mates, judgments, and assump\u0000ons during the prepara\u0000on of its consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP. These es\u0000mates, judgments, and assump\u0000ons impact the reported amounts of assets, liabili\u0000es, revenue, and expenses\nand the related disclosure of con\u0000ngent assets and liabili\u0000es. Actual results could differ from these es\u0000mates.\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its es\u0000mates and judgments including those related to: the fair values of cash equivalents, the carrying\nvalue of accounts receivable, including the determina\u0000on of the allowance for credit losses; the determina\u0000on of revenue reserves; the carrying value of\nright-of-use assets; the useful lives and recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment; the recoverability of goodwill and\nindefinite-lived intangible assets; the fair value of equity securi\u0000es without readily determinable fair values; con\u0000ngencies; unrecognized tax benefits; the\nvalua\u0000on allowance for deferred income tax assets; and the fair value of and forfeiture rates for stock-based awards, among others. The Company bases its\nes\u0000mates and judgments on historical experience, its forecasts and budgets, and other factors that the Company considers relevant.\nAccoun\u0000ng for Investments and Equity Securi\u0000es\nInvestments in equity securi\u0000es, other than those of our consolidated subsidiaries, are accounted for at fair value or under the measurement alterna\u0000ve\nof the Financial Accoun\u0000ng Standards Board’s (“FASB”) equity securi\u0000es guidance, with any changes to fair value recognized within other income (expense),\nnet each repor\u0000ng period. Under the measurement alterna\u0000ve, equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost minus\nimpairment, if any, plus or minus changes resul\u0000ng from observable price changes in orderly transac\u0000ons for iden\u0000cal or a similar investment of the same\nissuer; value is generally determined based on a market approach as of the transac\u0000on date. A security will be considered iden\u0000cal or similar if it has iden\u0000cal\nor similar rights to the equity securi\u0000es held by the Company. The Company reviews its equity securi\u0000es without readily determinable fair values for\nimpairment each repor\u0000ng period when there are qualita\u0000ve factors\n11\nTable of Contents\nMATCH GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Con\u0000nued)\nor events that indicate possible impairment. Factors we consider in making this determina\u0000on include nega\u0000ve changes in industry and market condi\u0000ons,\nfinancial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. When indicators of impairment exist, the Company prepares quan\u0000ta\u0000ve\nassessments of the fair value of our investments in equity securi\u0000es, which require judgment and the use of es\u0000mates. When our assessment indicates that\nthe fair value of the investment is below the carrying value, the Company writes down the security to its fair value and records the corresponding charge\nwithin other income (expense), net.\nRevenue Recogni\u0000on\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised services are transferred to our customers, and in the amount that reflects the considera\u0000on the\nCompany expects to be en\u0000tled to in exchange for those services.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of advance payments that are received or are contractually due in advance of the Company's performance. The Company’s\ndeferred revenue is reported on a contract by contract basis at the end of each repor\u0000ng period. The Company classifies deferred revenue as current when\nthe term of the applicable subscrip\u0000on period or expected comple\u0000on of our performance obliga\u0000on is one year or less.

Addi\u0000onally, ASU No. 2023-07 requires the disclosure of the \u0000tle and posi\u0000on of the Chief Opera\u0000ng Decision\nMaker. ASU No. 2023-07 does not change how a public en\u0000ty iden\u0000fies its opera\u0000ng segments, aggregates them, or applies the quan\u0000ta\u0000ve thresholds to\ndetermine its reportable segments. The new standard is effec\u0000ve on a retrospec\u0000ve basis for fiscal years beginning a\u0000er December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning a\u0000er December 15, 2024, with early adop\u0000on permi\u0000ed. We expect ASU No. 2023-07 to impact only our disclosures with\nno impacts to our results of opera\u0000ons, cash flows, or financial condi\u0000on.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, which focuses on the income tax rate reconcilia\u0000on and income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09\nrequires a tabular rate reconcilia\u0000on using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items\nfurther broken out by nature and jurisdic\u0000on to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold on an annual basis. In addi\u0000on, en\u0000\u0000es are required to\ndisclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received, disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign, and by jurisdic\u0000on, if the amount is at least 5% of total\nincome tax payments, net of refunds received. The new standard is effec\u0000ve for annual periods beginning a\u0000er December 15, 2024, with early adop\u0000on\npermi\u0000ed. An en\u0000ty may apply the amendments in this ASU prospec\u0000vely by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and\ncon\u0000nuing to provide the pre-ASU No. 2023-09 disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospec\u0000vely by providing the revised\ndisclosures for all periods presented. We expect ASU No. 2023-09 to impact only our disclosures with no impacts to our results of opera\u0000ons, cash flows, or\nfinancial condi\u0000on.\n13\nTable of Contents\nMATCH GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (Con\u0000nued)\nNOTE 2—INCOME TAXES\nAt the end of each interim period, the Company es\u0000mates the annual effec\u0000ve income tax rate and applies that rate to its ordinary year-to-date\nearnings or loss. The income tax provision or benefit related to significant, unusual, or extraordinary items, if applicable, that will be separately reported or\nreported net of their related tax effects, is individually computed and recognized in the interim period in which it occurs. In addi\u0000on, the effect of changes in\nenacted tax laws or rates, tax status, and judgment on the realizability of beginning-of-the-year deferred tax assets in future years or unrecognized tax\nbenefits is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs.\nThe computa\u0000on of the es\u0000mated annual effec\u0000ve income tax rate at each interim period requires certain es\u0000mates and assump\u0000ons including, but not\nlimited to, the expected pre-tax income (or loss) for the year, projec\u0000ons of the propor\u0000on of income (and/or loss) earned and taxed in foreign jurisdic\u0000ons,\npermanent and temporary differences, and the likelihood of the realiza\u0000on of deferred tax assets generated in the current year. The accoun\u0000ng es\u0000mates\nused to compute the provision or benefit for income taxes may change as new events occur, more experience is acquired, addi\u0000onal informa\u0000on is obtained\nor our tax environment changes. To the extent that the es\u0000mated annual effec\u0000ve income tax rate changes during a quarter, the effect of the change on prior\nquarters is included in the income tax provision in the quarter in which the change occurs.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $41.2 million and $47.3 million,\nrespec\u0000vely. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $113.5 million and $130.1 million,\nrespec\u0000vely. The effec\u0000ve tax rates for both the three and nine-month periods in 2024 and 2023 were higher than the U.S. statutory federal rate primarily\ndue to the effects of nondeduc\u0000ble stock-based compensa\u0000on, state income taxes, and foreign income taxed at higher rates. These effects were par\u0000ally\noffset by the lower tax rate on U.S. income derived from foreign sources and research credits. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 also\nincluded a benefit realized upon the conclusion of certain state income tax audits.\nMatch Group is rou\u0000nely under audit by federal, state, local, and foreign authori\u0000es in the area of income tax. These audits include a review of the\n\u0000ming and amount of income and deduc\u0000ons, and the alloca\u0000on of such income and deduc\u0000ons among various tax jurisdic\u0000ons. The Company is open to U.S.\nfederal audit for tax years a\u0000er December 31, 2019, and returns filed in various other jurisdic\u0000ons are open to examina\u0000on for tax years beginning with 2014.\nAlthough we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax posi\u0000ons, the final tax outcome of these ma\u0000ers may vary significantly from our\nes\u0000mates.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penal\u0000es, were $46.5 million and $45.8 million,\nrespec\u0000vely. If unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 are subsequently recognized, income tax expense would be reduced by $43.2 million, net of\nrelated deferred tax assets and interest. The comparable amount as of December 31, 2023 was $41.0 million. The Company believes that it is reasonably\npossible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $1.1 million by September 30, 2025 due to expira\u0000ons of statutes of limita\u0000ons, which would\nreduce the income tax provision.\nThe Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penal\u0000es related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Accruals of interest and\npenal\u0000es for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material. At September 30, 2024, noncurrent income taxes payable includes\naccrued interest and penal\u0000es of $1.4 million. The comparable amount as of December 31, 2023 was $0.9 million.\n14\nTable of Contents\nMATCH GROUP, INC.

For both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no adjustments to the carrying value of\nequity securi\u0000es without readily determinable fair values.\nFor all equity securi\u0000es without readily determinable fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has elected the\nmeasurement alterna\u0000ve. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, under the measurement alterna\u0000ve elec\u0000on, the Company\ndid not iden\u0000fy any fair value adjustments using observable price changes in orderly transac\u0000ons for an iden\u0000cal or similar investment of the same issuer.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that priori\u0000zes the inputs used in pricing the asset\nor liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n• Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted market prices for iden\u0000cal assets and liabili\u0000es in ac\u0000ve markets.\n• Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabili\u0000es in ac\u0000ve markets,\nquoted market prices for iden\u0000cal or similar assets or liabili\u0000es in markets that are not ac\u0000ve, and inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data. The fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial assets are primarily obtained from observable market\nprices for iden\u0000cal underlying securi\u0000es that may not be ac\u0000vely traded. Certain of these securi\u0000es may have different market prices from mul\u0000ple\nmarket data sources, in which case an average market price is used.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is li\u0000le or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assump\u0000ons, based on the best\ninforma\u0000on available in the circumstances, about the assump\u0000ons market par\u0000cipants would use in pricing the assets or liabili\u0000es.\nThe following tables present the Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nQuoted Market\nPrices in Ac\u0000ve\nMarkets for Significant Other Total\nIden\u0000cal Assets Observable Inputs Fair Value\n(Level 1) (Level 2) Measurements\n(In thousands)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 181,586 $ — $ 181,586\nTime deposits — 131,000 131,000\nShort-term investments:\nTime deposits — 5,323 5,323\nTotal $ 181,586 $ 136,323 $ 317,909\n15\nTable of Contents\nMATCH GROUP, INC.

The Company’s financial assets, comprised of equity securi\u0000es without readily determinable fair values, are\nadjusted to fair value when observable price changes are iden\u0000fied or an impairment charge is recognized.

The Company has re-allocated goodwill to each of the four repor\u0000ng units based on\ntheir rela\u0000ve fair values as of September 30, 2024. This change in repor\u0000ng units is considered a triggering event that requires a goodwill impairment\nassessment to be performed immediately before and a\u0000er the change. These goodwill impairment tests were performed by comparing the es\u0000mated fair\nvalue of each repor\u0000ng unit to its carrying value and no impairments were iden\u0000fied.

The Company establishes reserves for specific legal ma\u0000ers when it\ndetermines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably es\u0000mable. Management has also iden\u0000fied certain other\nlegal ma\u0000ers where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established. Although management currently believes\nthat resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results\nof opera\u0000ons, or financial condi\u0000on of the Company, these ma\u0000ers are subject to inherent uncertain\u0000es and management’s view of these ma\u0000ers may\nchange in the future. The Company also evaluates other con\u0000ngent ma\u0000ers, including income and non-income tax con\u0000ngencies, to assess the likelihood of\nan unfavorable outcome and es\u0000mated extent of poten\u0000al loss. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other\ncon\u0000ngencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of opera\u0000ons, or financial condi\u0000on of the Company.

See FTC v. Match Group, Inc., No. 3:19:cv-02281-K (Northern District of Texas). The complaint alleges that, prior to mid-\n2018, for marke\u0000ng purposes Match.com no\u0000fied non-paying users that other users were a\u0000emp\u0000ng to communicate with them, even though Match.com\nhad iden\u0000fied those subscriber accounts as poten\u0000ally fraudulent, thereby inducing non-paying users to subscribe and exposing them to the risk of fraud\nshould they subscribe. The complaint also challenges the adequacy of Match.com’s disclosure of the terms of its six-month guarantee, the efficacy of its\ncancella\u0000on process, and its handling of chargeback disputes. The complaint seeks among other things permanent injunc\u0000ve relief, civil penal\u0000es, res\u0000tu\u0000on,\ndisgorgement, and costs of suit. On March 24, 2022, the\n25\nTable of Contents\nMATCH GROUP, INC.

On July 19, 2022, the FTC\nfiled an amended complaint adding Match Group, LLC as a defendant. On September 11, 2023, both par\u0000es filed mo\u0000ons for summary judgment. The case is\nset for trial in June 2025. Our consolidated financial statements do not reflect any provision for a loss with respect to this ma\u0000er, as we do not believe there is\na probable likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. Further, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility of an exposure to loss that would be\nmaterial to our business. We believe we have strong defenses to the FTC’s claims regarding Match.com’s prac\u0000ces, policies, and procedures and will con\u0000nue\nto defend vigorously against them.\nIrish Data Protec\u0000on Commission Inquiry Regarding Tinder’s Prac\u0000ces\nOn February 3, 2020, we received a le\u0000er from the Irish Data Protec\u0000on Commission (the “DPC”) no\u0000fying us that the DPC had commenced an inquiry\nexamining Tinder’s compliance with the EU’s General Data Protec\u0000on Regula\u0000on (“GDPR”), focusing on Tinder’s processes for handling access and dele\u0000on\nrequests and Tinder’s user data reten\u0000on policies. On January 8, 2024, the DPC provided us with a preliminary dra\u0000 decision alleging that certain of Tinder’s\naccess and reten\u0000on policies, largely rela\u0000ng to protec\u0000ng the safety and privacy of Tinder’s users, violate GDPR requirements. We filed our response to the\npreliminary dra\u0000 decision on March 15, 2024. Our consolidated financial statements do not reflect any provision for a loss with respect to this ma\u0000er, as we\ndo not believe there is a probable likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. However, based on the preliminary dra\u0000 decision and giving due considera\u0000on to the\nuncertain\u0000es inherent in this process, there is at least a reasonable possibility of an exposure to loss, which could be anywhere between a nominal amount\nand $60 million, which we do not believe would be material to our business. We believe we have strong defenses to these claims and will defend vigorously\nagainst them.\n26\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condi\u0000on and Results of Opera\u0000ons\nBeginning with this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, Match Group will present our business units as\nfour opera\u0000ng segments consis\u0000ng of Tinder, Hinge, Match Group Asia, and Evergreen & Emerging. We believe providing addi\u0000onal informa\u0000on about these\nbusiness units will provide investors more insight into how we manage our por\u0000olio of brands to drive value at the Match Group level. Addi\u0000onally, we will\ninclude a “Corporate and unallocated costs” category for expenses, the components of which are defined below. As a result of these changes, we will no\nlonger report revenue by geography as we believe it is less insigh\u0000ul following the shi\u0000 to mul\u0000ple business units.\nKey Terms:\nOpera\u0000ng and financial metrics:\n• Tinder consists of the world-wide ac\u0000vity of the brand Tinder®.\n• Hinge consists of the world-wide ac\u0000vity of the brand Hinge®.\n• Match Group Asia (“MG Asia”) consists of the world-wide ac\u0000vity of the brands primarily focused on Asia and the Middle East, including Pairs™ and\nAzar®.\n• Evergreen & Emerging (“E&E”) consists of the world-wide ac\u0000vity primarily of the brands Match®, Mee\u0000c®, OkCupid®, Plenty Of Fish®, and a\nnumber of demographically focused brands.\n• Corporate and unallocated costs includes 1) corporate expenses (such as execu\u0000ve management, investor rela\u0000ons, corporate development, and\nboard of directors and public company lis\u0000ng fees), 2) por\u0000ons of corporate services (such as legal, human resources, accoun\u0000ng, and tax), and 3)\ncertain centrally managed services and technology that have not been allocated to the individual business segments (such as central trust and\nsafety opera\u0000ons and certain shared so\u0000ware).\n• Direct Revenue is revenue that is received directly from end users of our services and includes both subscrip\u0000on and à la carte revenue.\n• Indirect Revenue is revenue that is not received directly from an end user of our services, substan\u0000ally all of which is adver\u0000sing revenue.\n• Payers are unique users at a brand level in a given month from whom we earned Direct Revenue. When presented as a quarter-to-date or year-to-\ndate value, Payers represents the average of the monthly values for the respec\u0000ve period presented. At a consolidated level and a business unit\nlevel to the extent a business unit consists of mul\u0000ple brands, duplicate Payers may exist when we earn revenue from the same individual at\nmul\u0000ple brands in a given month, as we are unable to iden\u0000fy unique individuals across brands in the Match Group por\u0000olio.\n• Revenue Per Payer (“RPP”) is the average monthly revenue earned from a Payer and is Direct Revenue for a period divided by the Payers in the\nperiod, further divided by the number of months in the period.\nOpera\u0000ng costs and expenses:\n• Cost of revenue - consists primarily of the amor\u0000za\u0000on of in-app purchase fees, hos\u0000ng fees, compensa\u0000on expense (including stock-based\ncompensa\u0000on expense) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in data center and customer care func\u0000ons, live video costs, credit\ncard processing fees, and data center rent, energy, and bandwidth costs.

At the beginning of 2024, our live streaming services and Hakuna applica\u0000on collec\u0000vely\nwere projected to have 2024 annual total revenue of approximately $60 million. We incurred expenses of approximately $2.1 million in severance and other\ncosts related to the closure of these services in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nOpera\u0000ng income decreased 14% and Adjusted Opera\u0000ng Income increased 3%. Opera\u0000ng income and Adjusted Opera\u0000ng Income each benefited from\nthe increase in revenue of $13.9 million which was driven by growth at Hinge, and a decrease in cost of revenue due to lower live streaming costs related to\nthe termina\u0000on of live streaming services in 2024. These benefits were par\u0000ally offset by an increase in product development expenses related to employee\ncompensa\u0000on due to increases in headcount at Tinder and an increase in selling and marke\u0000ng expense, primarily at Tinder and Hinge. Opera\u0000ng income was\nfurther impacted by (i) impairments of intangible assets at E&E and MG Asia in 2024 as a result of the termina\u0000on of our live streaming services and Hakuna\nbrand, (ii) increased deprecia\u0000on expense due to increases in internally developed so\u0000ware placed in service, and (iii) increases in stock-based compensa\u0000on\nexpense, primarily as result of new stock-based awards granted in the current year.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nOpera\u0000ng income decreased 9% and Adjusted Opera\u0000ng Income increased 4%, primarily due to the factors described above in the three-month\ndiscussion. Opera\u0000ng income and Adjusted Opera\u0000ng Income were further impacted by increases in cost of revenue related to increases in web hos\u0000ng fees\nand in-app purchase fees, and increases in general and administra\u0000ve expense mainly due to increases in employee compensa\u0000on and increases in digital\nsales taxes.\nAt September 30, 2024, there was $400.1 million of unrecognized compensa\u0000on cost, net of es\u0000mated forfeitures, related to stock-based awards, which\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years.\n35\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 $ Change % Change 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest expense $ 40,120 $ (260) (1)% $ 40,380\nInterest expense remained rela\u0000vely flat as compared to the prior year.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 $ Change % Change 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInterest expense $ 120,511 $ 1,038 1% $ 119,473\nInterest expense remained rela\u0000vely flat as compared to the prior year.\nOther income, net\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 $ Change % Change 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOther income, net $ 7,100 $ (805) (10)% $ 7,905\nOther income, net in 2024 includes interest income of $11.3 million, par\u0000ally offset by $4.0 million in net foreign currency losses.\nOther income, net in 2023 includes interest income of $7.8 million, par\u0000ally offset by $0.7 million in net foreign currency losses.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 $ Change % Change 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOther income, net $ 27,099 $ 12,370 84% $ 14,729\nOther income, net in 2024 includes interest income of $31.7 million, par\u0000ally offset by $4.7 million in net foreign currency losses.\nOther income, net in 2023 includes interest income of $18.8 million, par\u0000ally offset by $4.8 million in net foreign currency losses.\n36\nTable of Contents\nIncome tax provision\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 $ Change % Change 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nIncome tax provision $ 41,159 $ (6,169) (13)% $ 47,328\nEffec\u0000ve income tax rate 23% 22%\nIn 2024 and 2023, the effec\u0000ve tax rates of 23% and 22%, respec\u0000vely, were higher than the statutory rate primarily due to the effects of nondeduc\u0000ble\nstock-based compensa\u0000on, state income taxes, and foreign income taxed at higher rates.

Adjusted Opera\u0000ng Income is among the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our\nbusiness, on which our internal budget is based, and by which management is compensated. Revenue excluding foreign exchange effects provides a\ncomparable framework for assessing how our business performed without the effect of exchange rate differences when compared to prior periods. We\nbelieve that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in\naddi\u0000on to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a subs\u0000tute for or superior to GAAP results. Match Group endeavors to\ncompensate for the limita\u0000ons of the non-GAAP measures presented by providing the comparable GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence and\ndescrip\u0000ons of the reconciling items, including quan\u0000fying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measures. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling\nadjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures, which we discuss below.\nAdjusted Opera\u0000ng Income\nAdjusted Opera\u0000ng Income is defined as opera\u0000ng income excluding: (1) stock-based compensa\u0000on expense; (2) deprecia\u0000on; and (3) acquisi\u0000on-\nrelated items consis\u0000ng of (i) amor\u0000za\u0000on of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses\nrecognized on changes in the fair value of con\u0000ngent considera\u0000on arrangements, as applicable. We believe this measure is useful to analysts and investors as\nthis measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our compe\u0000tors. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted\nOpera\u0000ng Income measure because they are non-cash in nature. Adjusted Opera\u0000ng Income has certain limita\u0000ons because it excludes the impact of certain\nexpenses.\nNon-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Adjusted Opera\u0000ng Income\nStock-based compensa\u0000on expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock op\u0000ons, restricted stock units (“RSUs”),\nperformance-based RSUs and market-based awards. These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares\noutstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable\nperformance or market condi\u0000on(s) have been met (assuming the end of the repor\u0000ng period is the end of the con\u0000ngency period). To the extent stock-\nbased awards are se\u0000led on a net basis, we remit the required tax-withholding amounts from current funds.\nDeprecia\u0000on is a non-cash expense rela\u0000ng to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of\ndepreciable assets to opera\u0000ons over their es\u0000mated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisi\u0000ons. At the \u0000me\nof an acquisi\u0000on, the iden\u0000fiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer lists, trade names, and technology, are valued\nand amor\u0000zed over their es\u0000mated lives. Value is also assigned to (i) acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of trade names and trademarks,\nand (ii) goodwill, which are not subject to amor\u0000za\u0000on. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair\nvalue. We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisi\u0000on and the related amor\u0000za\u0000on and\nimpairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables reconcile opera\u0000ng income (loss) to Adjusted Opera\u0000ng Income (Loss) for the Company’s reportable segments and at a\nconsolidated level:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nImpairments and\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of Adjusted Opera\u0000ng\nOpera\u0000ng Income (Loss) Stock-based Compensa\u0000on Deprecia\u0000on Intangibles Income (Loss)\n(In thousands)\nTinder $ 234,812 $ 22,601 $ 9,420 $ — $ 266,833\nHinge 42,241 8,599 620 — 51,460\nMG Asia (18,956) 5,844 8,031 22,860 17,779\nEvergreen & Emerging 2,965 13,310 5,918 19,230 41,423\nCorporate and unallocated costs (50,402) 14,134 1,313 — (34,955)\nTotal $ 210,660 $ 64,488 $ 25,302 $ 42,090 $ 342,540\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nAmor\u0000za\u0000on of Adjusted Opera\u0000ng\nOpera\u0000ng Income (Loss) Stock-based Compensa\u0000on Deprecia\u0000on Intangibles Income (Loss)\n(In thousands)\nTinder $ 256,513 $ 16,990 $ 7,991 $ — $ 281,494\nHinge 23,190 7,515 557 — 31,262\nMG Asia (2,324) 7,288 2,962 8,401 16,327\nEvergreen & Emerging 25,778 13,508 4,660 2,088 46,034\nCorporate and unallocated costs (59,598) 16,444 1,140 — (42,014)\nTotal $ 243,559 $ 61,745 $ 17,310 $ 10,489 $ 333,103\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nImpairments and\nStock-based Amor\u0000za\u0000on of Adjusted Opera\u0000ng\nOpera\u0000ng Income (Loss) Compensa\u0000on Deprecia\u0000on Intangibles Income (Loss)\n(In thousands)\nTinder $ 664,396 $ 66,557 $ 28,425 $ — $ 759,378\nHinge 90,978 29,978 1,702 — 122,658\nMG Asia (31,789) 20,683 16,957 39,204 45,055\nEvergreen & Emerging 39,566 41,978 15,910 24,205 121,659\nCorporate and unallocated costs (163,227) 38,979 3,921 — (120,327)\nTotal $ 599,924 $ 198,175 $ 66,915 $ 63,409 $ 928,423\n39\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nStock-based Amor\u0000za\u0000on of Adjusted Opera\u0000ng\nOpera\u0000ng Income (Loss) Compensa\u0000on Deprecia\u0000on Intangibles Income (Loss)\n(In thousands)\nTinder $ 718,521 $ 50,779 $ 16,447 $ — $ 785,747\nHinge 47,395 19,019 1,405 — 67,819\nMG Asia (1,784) 16,119 7,908 27,042 49,285\nEvergreen & Emerging 69,127 36,213 13,494 6,879 125,713\nCorporate and unallocated costs (176,615) 41,815 3,173 — (131,627)\nTotal $ 656,644 $ 163,945 $ 42,427 $ 33,921 $ 896,937\nEffects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates on Revenue\nThe impact of foreign exchange rates on the Company, due to its global reach, may be an important factor in understanding period over period\ncomparisons if movement in exchange rates is significant. Since our results are reported in U.S. dollars, interna\u0000onal revenue is favorably impacted as the U.S.\ndollar weakens rela\u0000ve to other currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S. dollar strengthens rela\u0000ve to other currencies. We believe the presenta\u0000on\nof revenue excluding the effects from foreign exchange, in addi\u0000on to reported revenue, helps improve investors’ ability to understand the Company’s\nperformance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency vola\u0000lity that is not indica\u0000ve of Match Group’s core opera\u0000ng results.\nRevenue excluding foreign exchange effects compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. Revenue\nexcluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by transla\u0000ng current period revenue using prior period exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue\nexcluding foreign exchange effects is calculated by determining the change in current period revenue over prior period revenue where current period revenue\nis translated using prior period exchange rates.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the impact of foreign exchange effects on total revenue and Direct Revenue by business unit, and RPP on a total basis, for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 $ Change % Change 2023 2024 $ Change % Change 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTotal Revenue, as reported $ 895,484 $ 13,884 2% $ 881,600 $ 2,619,197 $ 120,921 5% $ 2,498,276\nForeign exchange effects 11,028 58,920\nTotal Revenue excluding foreign exchange\neffects $ 906,512 $ 24,912 3% $ 881,600 $ 2,678,117 $ 179,841 7% $ 2,498,276\nTinder Direct Revenue, as reported $ 503,217 $ (5,304) (1)% $ 508,521 $ 1,464,649 $ 40,236 3% $ 1,424,413\nForeign exchange effects 7,922 34,582\nTinder Direct Revenue, excluding foreign\nexchange effects $ 511,139 $ 2,618 1% $ 508,521 $ 1,499,231 $ 74,818 5% $ 1,424,413\nHinge Direct Revenue, as reported $ 145,425 $ 38,160 36% $ 107,265 $ 402,747 $ 122,398 44% $ 280,349\nForeign exchange effects (563) (301)\nHinge Direct Revenue, excluding foreign\nexchange effects $ 144,862 $ 37,597 35% $ 107,265 $ 402,446 $ 122,097 44% $ 280,349\nMG Asia Direct Revenue, as reported $ 72,164 $ (4,601) (6)% $ 76,765 $ 217,307 $ (11,724) (5)% $ 229,031\nForeign exchange effects 3,679 22,877\nMG Asia Direct Revenue, excluding foreign\nexchange effects $ 75,843 $ (922) (1)% $ 76,765 $ 240,184 $ 11,153 5% $ 229,031\nE&E Direct Revenue, as reported $ 158,390 $ (15,859) (9)% $ 174,249 $ 487,925 $ (35,656) (7)% $ 523,581\nForeign exchange effects (203) 1,121\nE&E Direct Revenue, excluding foreign\nexchange effects $ 158,187 $ (16,062) (9)% $ 174,249 $ 489,046 $ (34,535) (7)% $ 523,581\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 $ Change % Change 2023 2024 $ Change % Change 2023\nRPP, as reported $ 19.26 $ 0.87 5% $ 18.39 $ 19.06 $ 1.71 10% $ 17.35\nForeign exchange effects 0.24 0.43\nRPP, excluding foreign exchange effects $ 19.50 $ 1.11 6% $ 18.39 $ 19.49 $ 2.14 12% $ 17.35\n41\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancial Posi\u0000on\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents:\nUnited States $ 589,118 $ 647,177\nAll other countries 266,414 215,263\nTotal cash and cash equivalents 855,532 862,440\nShort-term investments 5,323 6,200\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 860,855 $ 868,640\nLong-term debt:\nCredit Facility due March 20, 2029(a) $ — $ —\nTerm Loan due February 13, 2027 425,000 425,000\n5.00% Senior Notes due December 15, 2027 450,000 450,000\n4.625% Senior Notes due June 1, 2028 500,000 500,000\n5.625% Senior Notes due February 15, 2029 350,000 350,000\n4.125% Senior Notes due August 1, 2030 500,000 500,000\n3.625% Senior Notes due October 1, 2031 500,000 500,000\n2026 Exchangeable Notes due June 15, 2026 575,000 575,000\n2030 Exchangeable Notes due January 15, 2030 575,000 575,000\nTotal long-term debt 3,875,000 3,875,000\nLess: Unamor\u0000zed original issue discount 2,789 3,479\nLess: Unamor\u0000zed debt issuance costs 24,939 29,279\nTotal long-term debt, net $ 3,847,272 $ 3,842,242\n______________________\n(a) The maturity date of the Credit Facility is the earlier of (x) March 20, 2029 and (y) the date that is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Term Loan\nor the exis\u0000ng senior notes due 2027, 2028, or 2029, or any new indebtedness used to refinance the Term Loan or such senior notes that matures\nprior to the date that is 91 days a\u0000er March 20, 2029, in each case if and only if at least $250 million in aggregate principal amount of such debt is\noutstanding on such date.\nLong-term Debt\nFor a detailed descrip\u0000on of long-term debt, see “Note 4—Long-term Debt, net” to the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 1—\nConsolidated Financial Statements.”\n42\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow Informa\u0000on\nIn summary, the Company’s cash flows are as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es $ 678,009 $ 620,672\nNet cash used in inves\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es (51,072) (47,576)\nNet cash used in financing ac\u0000vi\u0000es (636,126) (436,506)\n2024\nNet cash provided by opera\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es in 2024 includes adjustments to earnings of $198.2 million of stock-based compensa\u0000on expense, $66.9\nmillion of deprecia\u0000on, and $63.4 million of impairments and amor\u0000za\u0000on of intangibles.

These changes were par\u0000ally offset by an increase in accounts payable and other liabili\u0000es of $15.7 million due to the \u0000ming of\npayments and an increase to working capital from taxes payable and receivable of $7.8 million primarily related to the \u0000ming of tax payments and receipt of\ntax refunds.\nNet cash used in inves\u0000ng ac\u0000vi\u0000es in 2023 consists primarily of capital expenditures of $50.0 million primarily related to internal development of\nso\u0000ware and purchases of computer hardware.\nNet cash used in financing ac\u0000vi\u0000es in 2023 is primarily due to purchases of treasury stock of $445.1 million, payments of $5.9 million of withholding\ntaxes paid on behalf of employees for net-se\u0000led stock-based awards, and purchases of non-controlling interests for $1.9 million. These uses of cash were\npar\u0000ally offset by $16.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock-based awards.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents as well as cash flows generated from opera\u0000ons. As of September 30,\n2024, $499.4 million was available under the Credit Facility.\nThe Company has various obliga\u0000ons related to long-term debt instruments and opera\u0000ng leases. For addi\u0000onal informa\u0000on on long-term debt,\nincluding maturity dates and interest rates, see “Note 4—Long-term Debt, net” to the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 1—Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.” For addi\u0000onal informa\u0000on on opera\u0000ng lease payments, including a schedule of obliga\u0000ons by year, see “Note 13—Leases” to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in “Item 8—Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company believes it has sufficient cash flows from opera\u0000ons to sa\u0000sfy these future obliga\u0000ons.\n43\nTable of Contents\nThe Company an\u0000cipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connec\u0000on with the development and expansion of its opera\u0000ons.\nThe Company expects that 2024 cash capital expenditures will be between $50 million and $55 million, rela\u0000vely flat to 2023 cash capital expenditures.\nWe have entered into various purchase commitments, primarily consis\u0000ng of web hos\u0000ng services. Our obliga\u0000ons under these various purchase\ncommitments are $105.6 million for 2025, and $14.2 million for 2026.\nAt September 30, 2024, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than as described above.\nOn January 30, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in aggregate\nvalue of shares of Match Group stock. Under the share repurchase program, shares of our common stock may be purchased on a discre\u0000onary basis from\n\u0000me to \u0000me, subject to general business and market condi\u0000ons and other investment opportuni\u0000es, through open market purchases, privately nego\u0000ated\ntransac\u0000ons or other means, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The share repurchase program may be commenced, suspended or discon\u0000nued at\nany \u0000me. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 19.1 million shares for $635.6 million on a trade date basis under the share\nrepurchase program. Between October 1 and November 1, 2024, we repurchased 3.0 million shares for $112.1 million. As of November 1, 2024, $252.3\nmillion in aggregate value of shares of Match Group stock remains available under the share repurchase program.\nAs of September 30, 2024, all of the Company’s interna\u0000onal cash can be repatriated without significant tax consequences.\nOur indebtedness could limit our ability to: (i) obtain addi\u0000onal financing to fund working capital needs, acquisi\u0000ons, capital expenditures, debt service,\nor other requirements; and (ii) use opera\u0000ng cash flow to pursue acquisi\u0000ons or invest in other areas, such as developing proper\u0000es and exploi\u0000ng business\nopportuni\u0000es. The Company may need to raise addi\u0000onal capital through future debt or equity financing to make addi\u0000onal acquisi\u0000ons and investments or\nto provide for greater financial flexibility. Addi\u0000onal financing may not be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagement of the Company is required to make certain es\u0000mates, judgments and assump\u0000ons during the prepara\u0000on of its consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These es\u0000mates, judgments and assump\u0000ons impact the reported amount of assets, liabili\u0000es, revenue and\nexpenses and the related disclosure of con\u0000ngent assets and liabili\u0000es. Actual results could differ from these es\u0000mates.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the Company’s cri\u0000cal accoun\u0000ng policies and es\u0000mates since\nthe disclosure in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n44\nTable of Contents\nItem 3.

Controls and Procedures\nThe Company monitors and evaluates on an ongoing basis its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial repor\u0000ng in order to\nimprove their overall effec\u0000veness. In the course of these evalua\u0000ons, the Company modifies and refines its internal processes as condi\u0000ons warrant.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securi\u0000es Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Match Group management, including our\nprincipal execu\u0000ve and principal financial officers, evaluated the effec\u0000veness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by Rule 13a-\n15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evalua\u0000on, management has concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effec\u0000ve as\nof the end of the period covered by this report in providing reasonable assurance that informa\u0000on we are required to disclose in our filings with the Securi\u0000es\nand Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the \u0000me periods specified in the Commission's\nrules and forms, and includes controls and procedures designed to ensure that informa\u0000on required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit\nunder the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal execu\u0000ve and principal financial officers, as\nappropriate to allow \u0000mely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere were no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial repor\u0000ng during the period covered by this report that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial repor\u0000ng.\n45\nTable of Contents\nPART II\nOTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nOverview\nWe are, and from \u0000me to \u0000me may become, involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business ac\u0000vi\u0000es, such as\ntrademark and patent infringement claims, trademark opposi\u0000ons, and consumer or adver\u0000sing complaints, as well as stockholder deriva\u0000ve ac\u0000ons, class\nac\u0000on lawsuits, mass arbitra\u0000ons, and other ma\u0000ers. The amounts that may be recovered in such ma\u0000ers may be subject to insurance coverage. The\nli\u0000ga\u0000on ma\u0000ers described below involve issues or claims that may be of par\u0000cular interest to our stockholders, regardless of whether any of these ma\u0000ers\nmay be material to our financial posi\u0000on or opera\u0000ons based upon the standard set forth in the SEC’s rules.\nPursuant to the Transac\u0000on Agreement, entered into in connec\u0000on with our separa\u0000on from IAC/InterAc\u0000veCorp, now known as IAC Inc. (“IAC”), we\nhave agreed to indemnify IAC for ma\u0000ers rela\u0000ng to any business of Former Match Group, including indemnifying IAC for costs related to the ma\u0000ers\ndescribed below other than the ma\u0000er described under the heading “Newman Deriva\u0000ve and Stockholder Class Ac\u0000on Regarding Separa\u0000on Transac\u0000on”.\nThe official names of legal proceedings in the descrip\u0000ons below (shown in italics) reflect the original names of the par\u0000es when the proceedings were\nfiled as opposed to the current names of the par\u0000es following the separa\u0000on of Match Group and IAC.\nConsumer Class Ac\u0000on Li\u0000ga\u0000on Challenging Tinder’s Age-Tiered Pricing\nOn May 28, 2015, a puta\u0000ve state-wide class ac\u0000on was filed against Tinder in state court in California. See Allan Candelore v. Tinder, Inc., No. BC583162\n(Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles). The complaint principally alleges that Tinder violated California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act by offering and\ncharging users over a certain age a higher price than younger users for subscrip\u0000ons to its premium Tinder Plus service. On July 15, 2024, the court granted\nPlain\u0000ff’s mo\u0000on to cer\u0000fy a class based upon California Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold subscribers age 29 and over. We believe that we have strong defenses to\nthe allega\u0000ons in the Candelore lawsuit and will con\u0000nue to defend vigorously against it.\nFTC Lawsuit Against Former Match Group\nOn September 25, 2019, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Texas against the company\nformerly known as Match Group (“Former Match Group”). See FTC v. Match Group, Inc., No. 3:19:cv-02281-K (Northern District of Texas). The complaint\nalleges that, prior to mid-2018, for marke\u0000ng purposes Match.com no\u0000fied non-paying users that other users were a\u0000emp\u0000ng to communicate with them,\neven though Match.com had iden\u0000fied those subscriber accounts as poten\u0000ally fraudulent, thereby inducing non-paying users to subscribe and exposing\nthem to the risk of fraud should they subscribe. The complaint also challenges the adequacy of Match.com’s disclosure of the terms of its six-month\nguarantee, the efficacy of its cancella\u0000on process, and its handling of chargeback disputes. The complaint seeks among other things permanent injunc\u0000ve\nrelief, civil penal\u0000es, res\u0000tu\u0000on, disgorgement, and costs of suit. On March 24, 2022, the court granted our mo\u0000on to dismiss with prejudice on Claims I and II\nof the complaint rela\u0000ng to communica\u0000on no\u0000fica\u0000ons and granted our mo\u0000on to dismiss with respect to all requests for monetary damages on Claims III\nand IV rela\u0000ng to the guarantee offer and chargeback policy. On July 19, 2022, the FTC filed an amended complaint adding Match Group, LLC as a defendant.\nOn September 11, 2023, both par\u0000es filed mo\u0000ons for summary judgment. The case is set for trial in June 2025. We believe we have strong defenses to the\nFTC’s claims regarding Match.com’s prac\u0000ces, policies, and procedures and will con\u0000nue to defend vigorously against them.\nIrish Data Protec\u0000on Commission Inquiry Regarding Tinder’s Prac\u0000ces\nOn February 3, 2020, we received a le\u0000er from the Irish Data Protec\u0000on Commission (the “DPC”) no\u0000fying us that the DPC had commenced an inquiry\nexamining Tinder’s compliance with the EU’s General Data Protec\u0000on Regula\u0000on (“GDPR”), focusing on Tinder’s processes for handling access and dele\u0000on\nrequests and Tinder’s user data reten\u0000on policies. On January 8, 2024, the DPC provided us with a preliminary dra\u0000 decision\n46\nTable of Contents\nalleging that certain of Tinder’s access and reten\u0000on policies, largely rela\u0000ng to protec\u0000ng the safety and privacy of Tinder’s users, violate GDPR\nrequirements. We filed our response to the preliminary dra\u0000 decision on March 15, 2024. We believe we have strong defenses to these claims and will defend\nvigorously against them.\nNewman Deriva\u0000ve and Stockholder Class Ac\u0000on Regarding Separa\u0000on Transac\u0000on\nOn June 24, 2020, a Former Match Group shareholder filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Former Match Group and its board of\ndirectors, as well as Match Group, IAC Holdings, Inc., and Barry Diller seeking to recover unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the Company and\ndirectly as a result of his ownership of Former Match Group stock in rela\u0000on to the separa\u0000on of Former Match Group from its former majority shareholder,\nMatch Group. See David Newman et al. v. IAC/Interac\u0000ve Corp. et al., C.A. No. 2020-0505-MTZ (Delaware Court of Chancery). The complaint alleges that that\nthe special commi\u0000ee established by Former Match Group’s board of directors to nego\u0000ate with Match Group regarding the separa\u0000on transac\u0000on was not\nsufficiently independent of control from Match Group and Mr. Diller and that Former Match Group board members failed to adequately protect Former\nMatch Group’s interest in nego\u0000a\u0000ng the separa\u0000on transac\u0000on, which resulted in a transac\u0000on that was unfair to Former Match Group and its shareholders.\nOn January 21, 2021, the case was consolidated with other shareholder ac\u0000ons, and an amended complaint was filed on April 14, 2021. See In Re Match\nGroup, Inc. Deriva\u0000ve Li\u0000ga\u0000on, Consolidated C.A. No. 2020-0505-MTZ (Delaware Court of Chancery). On September 1, 2022, the court granted defendants’\nmo\u0000on to dismiss with prejudice. On October 3, 2022, plain\u0000ffs filed an amended no\u0000ce of appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court, and on April 4, 2024,\nthe Delaware Supreme Court reversed and remanded the Chancery Court’s dismissal, except for the Chancery Court’s dismissal of deriva\u0000ve claims, which the\nSupreme Court affirmed. We believe we have strong defenses to the allega\u0000ons in this lawsuit and the appeal and will defend vigorously against them.\nFTC Inves\u0000ga\u0000on of Certain Subsidiary Data Privacy Representa\u0000ons\nOn March 19, 2020, the FTC issued an ini\u0000al Civil Inves\u0000ga\u0000ve Demand (“CID”) to the Company requiring us to produce certain documents and\ninforma\u0000on regarding the allegedly wrongful conduct of OkCupid in 2014 and our public statements in 2019 regarding such conduct and whether such\nconduct and statements were unfair or decep\u0000ve under the FTC Act. On May 26, 2022, the FTC filed a Pe\u0000\u0000on to Enforce Match Civil Inves\u0000ga\u0000ve Demand.\nSee FTC v. Match Group, Inc., No. 1:22-mc-00054 (District of Columbia). We believe we have strong defenses to the FTC's inves\u0000ga\u0000on and pe\u0000\u0000on to enforce\nand will defend vigorously against them.\nBardaji Securi\u0000es Class Ac\u0000on\nOn March 6, 2023, a Match Group shareholder filed a complaint in federal district court in Delaware against Match Group, Inc., its Chief Execu\u0000ve\nOfficer, its former Chief Execu\u0000ve Officer, and its President and Chief Financial Officer seeking to recover unspecified monetary damages on behalf of a class\nof acquirers of Match Group securi\u0000es between November 3, 2021 and January 31, 2023. See Leopold Riola Bardaji v. Match Group, Inc. et al, No. 1:23-cv-\n00245-UNA (District of Delaware). The complaint alleges that Match Group, Inc. misrepresented and/or failed to disclose that its Tinder business was not\neffec\u0000vely execu\u0000ng on its new product ini\u0000a\u0000ves; as a result, Tinder was not on track to deliver its planned product ini\u0000a\u0000ves in 2022; and therefore, Match\nGroup, Inc.’s statements about its Tinder’s business, product ini\u0000a\u0000ves, opera\u0000ons, and prospects lacked a reasonable basis. On July 24, 2023, lead plain\u0000ff\nNorthern California Pipe Trades Trust Funds filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint added allega\u0000ons regarding misrepresenta\u0000ons rela\u0000ng to\nMatch Group's acquisi\u0000on of Hyperconnect and the business' subsequent integra\u0000on and performance. On September 20, 2023, defendants filed a mo\u0000on to\ndismiss. On July 12, 2024, the court granted defendants’ mo\u0000on to dismiss without prejudice. We believe that we have strong defenses to the allega\u0000ons in\nthis lawsuit and will defend vigorously against them.\nOksayan Class Ac\u0000on\nOn February 14, 2024, a puta\u0000ve class ac\u0000on lawsuit was filed against Match Group, Inc. in the Northern District of California by six plain\u0000ffs from\nCalifornia, New York, Georgia, and Florida. Among other things, Plain\u0000ffs allege that the Tinder, Hinge, and The League apps are designed to be \"addic\u0000ve\" in\nviola\u0000on of various consumer protec\u0000on, product liability, negligence, and other laws. Plain\u0000ffs claim that these services’ business models and features addict\nunsuspec\u0000ng users, leading to increased depression, loneliness, among other things. Plain\u0000ffs further allege that Tinder, Hinge, and The League failed to warn\nthem of the risks of addic\u0000on and that the apps are engaging in fraudulent business prac\u0000ces by marke\u0000ng their apps in a misleading way. Plain\u0000ffs\n47\nTable of Contents\nseek monetary damages, as well as injunc\u0000ve relief (implemen\u0000ng warnings, discon\u0000nuing certain marke\u0000ng campaigns, providing resources). On June 10,\n2024, plain\u0000ffs filed an amended complaint, and on July 22, 2024, we filed a mo\u0000on to compel plain\u0000ffs’ claims to arbitra\u0000on. Plain\u0000ffs filed a second\namended complaint on August 12, 2024, and we filed a mo\u0000on to dismiss on September 18, 2024. We believe that we have strong defenses to the allega\u0000ons\nin this lawsuit and will defend vigorously against them.\nItem 1A.

All\nstatements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements.” The use of words such as “an\u0000cipates,” “es\u0000mates,” “expects,” “plans,” and\n“believes,” among others, generally iden\u0000fy forward-looking statements.
