As technology evolved – seemingly at warp\nspeed – digital banking became the next big thing, and non-\ntraditional financial services providers like big techs and fintechs\nwere suddenly competing with traditional community and regional\nfinancial institutions for a piece of the financial services pie.\nExecutive Overview | 01\nFinancial Health\nThen, the economic disruption brought on by the pandemic\nadded fuel to the already-burning fire of a national financial\nhealth crisis. Branch shutdowns across the country left consumers\nscrambling to find alternative ways to conduct their financial\nbusiness, and with an abundance of financial apps available –\noffering everything from checking and savings accounts to credit\ncards and investment services – consumers grew comfortable\nutilizing multiple sources to meet their changing financial needs.\nThis rapid and pervasive adoption of digital technology\nseemed like the perfect way to manage finances in a world\nwhere traditional face-to-face banking was temporarily\nsuspended, but it ultimately created an environment of\nfinancial fragmentation. Now, with consumers dividing their\nfinancial resources between multiple providers, it has become\nincreasingly difficult for them to get a complete and accurate\npicture of their financial health. And without a clear picture,\nconsumers are unable to make informed decisions, leaving\nthem ill-prepared to properly manage their finances.\nFortunately, the economic upheaval of the past few years has\nhad a positive side effect: it’s given people an opportunity to\nBased on 2021 data, financial take a long, hard look at their finances – and has sparked a\ndesire to get their financial houses in order.

In\nother words, they want to be financially healthy. And they want\nstruggling financially.\ntheir primary financial institution to help make that happen.\nwhat is financial health?\nBroadly speaking, financial health describes the state of\nan individual’s personal monetary affairs. There are many\ndimensions to financial health, including savings, debt,\nspending, and financial planning.1 A financial health business,\naccording to Jennifer Tescher, President and CEO of Financial\nHealth Network, is one that drives bottom-line success by\nhelping accountholders improve their financial health.2\nExecutive Overview | 02\nFinancial Health\nTescher founded Financial Health Network in 2004 to explore\nways to use technological changes in financial services\nto benefit those who need it most. The organization has a\ngrowing membership network of more than 160 companies\nand organizations that support its mission of uniting business\nleaders, policymakers, and innovators to design and implement\nsolutions that improve financial health for all people.3\nTescher identifies three important facts about financial health:\n1. The term “financial health” is not an abstract, unclassifiable\nconcept. It has a definition: Financial health comes about\nAs of May 2021, a staggering\nwhen you have a day-to-day system that enables you to\n66% of individuals in the U.S. build resilience and thrive financially.4 This applies to your\nwere not financially healthy. financial institution, and also to your accountholders.\n2. For community and regional financial institutions engaged\nin a financial health business, financial health can be\nmeasured quantitatively and tracked over time as a key\nperformance indicator (KPI).\n3. By measuring and tracking the financial health of\naccountholders, financial institutions can address, unlock,\nand improve several key business metrics, including\nretention, engagement, and cross-sell.\nDeveloping and implementing strategies to guide the\nfinancial well-being efforts of their accountholders is one way\nbanks and credit unions can address and help mitigate the\nfinancial health crisis in their own communities. It’s a huge\nopportunity to stand out in a crowded financial services\nmarket – especially as fintechs and other non-traditional\nproviders boldly invade territory that once belonged solely\nto the community bank or credit union down the street.\nindustry disruption +\ndigital transformation =\nfinancial fragmentation\nThe way that people prefer to handle their financial transactions\nis changing dramatically. Today’s consumers want more\nfrom financial institutions than just checking and savings\naccounts. They’re looking for investing, budgeting, planning,\nExecutive Overview | 03\nFinancial Health\nand other specialized financial services, and if those services\naren’t provided by their primary financial institution, they\ndon’t hesitate to look elsewhere for financial solutions. For\nmany consumers – especially the younger generation –\n“elsewhere” often means individual financial provider apps.\nA recent Javelin report shows that non-banks now provide 65%\npercent of financial relationships for millennial consumers\n(those born from 1981–1996) and 69% for Gen Z consumers\n(those born from 1997–2012). Additionally, a large number of\nconsumers get their financial services from many different\nproviders – both traditional and non-traditional financial\ninstitutions. It’s not uncommon for a consumer to use between\n20 and 30 different financial applications and services.5 In\nfact, the percentage of U.S. consumers using fintech rose\nfrom 58% in 2020 to 88% just a year later, in 2021.6\n80% of consumers want their\nThis digital transformation that’s occurring in the banking\nfinancial institution to help\nand financial industry has brought speed, convenience, and\nthem improve their financial\nefficiency into the lives of consumers across the globe.

When the pieces\nof an individual’s financial life are scattered among so many\nactually helping.\ndifferent sources, there is no longer one source of the truth for\ntheir financial lives – and it becomes difficult for individuals\nto get a complete, accurate picture of their finances. Without\na clear, comprehensive financial picture, many consumers\nfind it difficult to make good financial decisions7, which\ncan negatively affect their overall financial health.\nCommunity and regional financial institutions must embrace\nthe digital transformation occurring in the financial industry to\nremain relevant and compete successfully with non-traditional\ncounterparts. They must also look for any consumer pain points\nthat new technology creates – and capitalize on opportunities\nto provide innovative solutions. When it comes to financial\nfragmentation, community and regional financial institutions have\na unique opportunity to do something that big techs, fintechs,\nand megabanks can’t: leverage their personal relationships with\naccountholders to provide customized resources and services.\nExecutive Overview | 04\nFinancial Health\nFor financial institutions to successfully provide\naccountholders with customized solutions, they must\nfirst identify and understand accountholders’ needs.\nAnd that process begins with measurement.\nmeasuring financial health\nData aggregation enables consumers to see the truth of their\nfinancial lives in one place – and community and regional financial\nFinancially healthy people\ninstitutions should be the central source for measuring, assessing,\nare better, more loyal, and and delivering that financial truth to their accountholders.\nmore profitable consumers.\nFinancial institutions often use the Net Promoter Score (NPS)\nto gauge the level of satisfaction of their accountholders.\nBut an NPS score isn’t necessarily a good indicator of\nfinancial health because it doesn’t ask the right questions.\nIn an NPS survey, participants rate their level of satisfaction\nwith an institution, its products, or its customer service. But\nassessing financial health requires more than that.\nFinancial health considers the totality of an individual’s\nfinancial life: whether they are spending, saving, borrowing,\nand planning in ways that will enable them to be resilient\nand pursue opportunities. That’s why the FinHealth Score®\nis a more accurate measurement of financial health.8\nDeveloped by Financial Health Network, the FinHealth Score is\na metric that uses survey questions to assess financial health.\nThe survey questions align with eight indicators of financial\nhealth across four categories: Spend, Save, Borrow, and Plan.\nSpend\n• Spend less than income.\n• Pay bills on time and in full.\nSave\n• Have sufficient liquid savings.\n• Have sufficient long-term savings.\nExecutive Overview | 05\nFinancial Health\nBorrow\n• Have manageable debt.\n• Have a prime credit score.\nPlan\n• Have appropriate insurance.\n• Plan ahead financially.\nAn aggregate FinHealth Score and four subscores (spend,\nsave, borrow, and plan) are calculated for individuals who\nVulnerable (a score from\nanswer all eight survey questions.

The good news is that, as of May 2021,\nmore than 34% of individuals in the U.S. – or 86 million people –\nwere considered financially healthy, up from 32% in 2020.\nExecutive Overview | 06\nFinancial Health\nHowever, that means there’s also some not-so-good news: As\nof May 2021, a staggering 66% of individuals in the U.S. were\nnot financially healthy. Fifty-two percent (131 million people)\nwere coping and 14% (35 million people) were vulnerable –\nmeaning that the majority of Americans struggled to spend,\nsave, borrow, or plan in ways that would allow them to\nrecover successfully from challenges or take advantage of\nopportunities to improve their circumstances.11 Moreover,\n39% of Americans lacked three months of savings, 25% had\nAs financial first responders, unmanageable debt, and 39% did not plan ahead financially.12\ncommunity and regional\nThe Pulse survey results also show that not only are many\nfinancial institutions have an\nAmericans struggling financially, but there are extensive\nopportunity to address the gender and racial disparities among those who report\nfinancial crisis as a whole, and being financially healthy.

And as\nfinancial first responders, community and regional financial\ninstitutions have an opportunity to address the financial crisis\nas a whole, and more specifically, close the racial and gender\ngaps in financial health that their accountholders face.\nExecutive Overview | 07\nFinancial Health\nIn times of financial difficulty, your accountholders reach out\nto you for solutions. When they do, your primary responsibility\nis to be there in moments of need to provide them with the\neducation, resources, and tools that build financial stability.\nAccording to Plaid, an organization focused on democratizing\nfinancial services through technology, financial health is an\nuntapped opportunity for financial institutions. A 2021 Plaid article\nnotes that consumers are moving to financial services providers\nthat help them make smart choices with their money. This is\nshown by the rapid growth of Chime, a digital bank that offers\nfinancial health-related services including fee-free overdrafts,\nearly paycheck access, and help with building credit history and\nCommunity and\ngrowing savings.14 A 2020 Accenture study also supports the\nregional financial\nidea that consumers want help managing their money, finding\ninstitutions are rooted in that 61% of consumers (up from 53% in 2018) would welcome\nrelationship banking. budget information based on their monthly spending.15\nIn its Financial Health Pulse: 2020 U.S. Trends Report, Financial\nHealth Network found that 80% of consumers want their\nfinancial institution to help them improve their financial health,\nbut only 14% feel that their credit union or bank is actually\nhelping. Similarly, Accenture found that in 2020, only 29% of\nconsumers trusted their financial institution “a lot” to look after\ntheir financial well-being, down from 43% just two years prior, in\n2018.16That’s a significant gap between what consumers expect\nand what they’re getting – and it represents a huge opportunity\nfor community and regional financial institutions to create\ninnovative, specialized products and services to bridge that gap.\nWhen your accountholders are financially healthy, it’s not just\ngood for them. It’s good for you, too. Financially healthy people\nare better, more loyal, and more profitable consumers. They’re\nthree times more likely to recommend their financial institution\nto friends and family, two times more likely to continue their\nrelationship over the next five years, and five times more likely\nto be interested in buying additional products and services.17\nExecutive Overview | 08\nFinancial Health\nleading your\naccountholders into a\nfinancially healthy future\nsources\n1.
