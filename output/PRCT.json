As a result, we delivered another successful quarter with annual revenue growth of 66% and record gross margins of 63.2%.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $58.4 million, an increase of 66% compared to the prior year period. U.S. revenue was $52.2 million, representing growth of 62% compared to the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increased system sales, higher system average selling prices, and increased handpiece and other consumable revenue. U.S. handpiece and consumable revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $29.6 million, an increase of 74% compared to the prior year period. U.S. system revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $19.6 million, an increase of 46% compared to the prior year period. As of September 30, 2024, the install base of robotic systems in the U.S. was 445 systems. International revenue was $6.2 million for the quarter, an increase of 122% compared to the prior year period.\n\nGross margin for the third quarter 2024 was 63.2% compared to 53.8% in the prior year period. Gross margin improvement was primarily due to improved overhead absorption and increased U.S. robotic system average selling prices.\n\nOperating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $59.3 million, compared with $44.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by increased sales and marketing expenses primarily to expand the commercial organization and increased research and development expenses.\n\nNet loss was $21.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $24.6 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $12.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $19.4 million in the prior year period.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of September 30, 2024, totaled $199.8 million.\n\n**Full Year 2024 Financial Guidance**\n\n  * The Company projects revenue for the full year 2024 to be in the range of $222.5 million to $223.0 million, which represents 63% and 64% growth respectfully over the Company’s prior year revenue. This compares to previous revenue guidance of $217.0 million.\n  * The Company projects full year 2024 gross margin to be approximately 61%. This compares to previous guidance of approximately 59%.\n  * The Company projects full year 2024 total operating expense of approximately $231.5 million, which is unchanged from previously issued guidance.\n  * The Company projects full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA loss to be ($60.0) million. This compares to previous guidance of ($67.5) million.\n\n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). For more information about the Company’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section below titled “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited).”\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** PROCEPT BioRobotics will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results on Monday, October 28, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nInvestors interested in listening to the conference call may do so by following one of the below links:\n\n  * Webcast link for interested listeners: \n    * https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/yhamkcsz\n  * Dial-in registration for sell-side research analysts: \n    * https://register.vevent.com/register/BI271ff7de75a342d8941d642d1900ba40\n\n\n\n**About PROCEPT BioRobotics Corporation** PROCEPT BioRobotics is a surgical robotics company focused on advancing patient care by developing transformative solutions in urology. PROCEPT BioRobotics manufactures the AQUABEAM® and HYDROS™ Robotic Systems. The HYDROS Robotic System is the only AI-Powered, robotic technology that delivers Aquablation therapy. PROCEPT BioRobotics designed Aquablation therapy to deliver effective, safe, and durable outcomes for males suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms or LUTS, due to BPH that are independent of prostate size and shape or surgeon experience. BPH is the most common prostate disease and impacts approximately 40 million men in the United States. The Company has developed a significant and growing body of clinical evidence with over 150 peer-reviewed publications, supporting the benefits and clinical advantages of Aquablation therapy.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)** This press release references Adjusted EBITDA, a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company believes that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors about the Company in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in financial and operational decision making. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore any non-GAAP measures the Company uses may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This release contains forward‐looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including with respect to the Company’s projected financial performance for full year 2024, statements regarding the potential utilities, values, benefits and advantages of Aquablation® therapy performed using PROCEPT BioRobotics’ products, including AquaBeam® Robotic System, which involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results and expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements.
