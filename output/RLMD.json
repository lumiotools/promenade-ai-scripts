(Nasdaq: RLMD, “Relmada”, “the Company”), a late-stage biotechnology company addressing diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), today provided a corporate update and announced preliminary and unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company will host a conference call today, Thursday, November 7, at 4:30 PM ET.\n\n“We believe that Relmada’s clinical programs are poised to achieve meaningful, near-term value inflection points. Our lead product candidate, REL-1017, is in a registrational Phase 3 program as a potential adjunct treatment for major depressive disorder. Two ongoing trials, Reliance II and Relight, have been designed to build on positive Phase 2 results, with enhanced site selection and more stringent patient enrollment criteria,” said **Sergio Traversa, Chief Executive Officer** of Relmada. “The Reliance II study also incorporates a pre-planned interim analysis to evaluate futility and sample size. We believe that the outcome, expected by year-end represents an important de-risking event for the REL-1017 program and the Company.”\n\n**Mr. Traversa** continued, “In addition, we expect to initiate a Phase 1 safety study for REL-P11 for metabolic disease shortly. The low-dose, modified-release psilocybin formulation improved multiple metabolic parameters in preclinical models and could provide a valuable therapeutic option in the evolving obesity and metabolic syndrome space. The Phase 1 study is expected to be conducted in Canada and will define the pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability profile of REL-P11 in obese subjects. A Phase 2a proof-of-concept study is expected to begin in H1 2025.”\n\n**Upcoming Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * **Reliance II Interim Analysis Expected by YE 2024**\n  * **Initiate Enrollment in the REL-P11 Program by YE 2024**\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $11.1 million, compared to $10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $0.7 million.

The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in study costs associated with the completion of two Phase 3 trials and the long-term, open-label, safety trial (Study 310) in 2023.\n  * General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $29.6 million compared to $36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately $7.2 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\n  * Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $43.0 million compared to $41.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $61.3 million, or $2.03 per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss of $73.6 million, or $2.45 per basic and diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $54.1 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $96.3 million at December 31, 2023.

(Nasdaq: RLMD, “Relmada”, “the Company”), a late-stage biotechnology company addressing diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), today provided a corporate update and announced preliminary and unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company will host a conference call today, Wednesday, August 7, at 4:30 PM ET.\n\n“Relmada’s clinical programs have made meaningful progress this year. We believe that the portfolio, led by the Phase 3 program for REL-1017 as a potential adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), is poised to reach important milestones that could represent inflection points for Relmada,” said Sergio Traversa, Chief Executive Officer of Relmada. “We believe that our two ongoing Phase 3 trials, Reliance II and Relight, have been carefully designed to enhance the probability of success by appropriate patient adjudication in each study. We expect to complete enrollment in Reliance II by year-end 2024, to be followed by Relight 6-months after that.”\n\nDr. Traversa continued, “The Reliance II study design incorporates a pre-planned interim analysis to evaluate futility and a sample size re-estimation, if necessary, aimed at de-risking the program. We expect to conduct this analysis and report the outcome before year-end 2024. In addition, we are advancing preparations to begin the clinical program for REL-P11, our low-dose, modified-release psilocybin formulation for potential treatment of metabolic disorders, and intend to initiate a Phase 1 study in Canada before year-end 2024. Importantly, we believe that our financial resources are adequate to support our planned operations through key milestones, into 2025.”\n\n**Upcoming Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * **Output of Reliance II Interim Analysis Expected before YE 2024** : Relmada intends to announce the output of a pre-planned interim analysis for the Phase 3 Reliance II study as soon as available. The interim analysis will assess futility and, if recommended, provide a sample size re-estimation for the study.\n  * **Completion of Enrollment in Phase 3 Reliance II Study Anticipated by YE 2024** : Relmada expects to complete enrollment in the randomized, controlled Phase 3 Reliance II study by YE 2024, to be followed by Relight approximately 6-months after. The two pivotal studies are designed to evaluate REL 1017’s potential to improve treatment outcomes, measured by a change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS10) at Day 28.\n  * **Initiate Enrollment in the REL-P11 Program by YE 2024** : Relmada plans to initiate a Phase 1 safety study in Canada for REL-P11 by YE 2024. The Phase 1 study will define the pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability profile of REL-P11 in obese subjects. Topline Phase 1 results and the initiation of a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study are expected in H1 2025. \n\n\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Research and development expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024, totaled $10.7 million, compared to $13.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of $3.0 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in study costs associated with the completion of two Phase 3 trials and the long-term, open-label, safety trial (Study 310).\n  * General and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024, totaled $8.1 million compared to $12.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately $4.2 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense.\n  * Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended June 30, 2024, totaled $13.3 million compared to $13.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n  * The net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was $17.8 million, or $0.59 per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss of $25.3 million, or $0.84 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Six Month Ended June 30, 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Research and development expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, totaled $24.0 million, compared to $29.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of $5.6 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in study costs associated with the completion of two Phase 3 trials and the long-term, open-label, safety trial (Study 310).\n  * General and administrative expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024, totaled $17.8 million compared to $24.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately $6.8 million.

Relmada is developing REL-1017 as a rapid-acting, oral, once-daily adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The clinical program includes two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, Reliance II (Study 302, NCT04855747) and Relight (Study 304, NCT06011577). The studies are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of REL-1017. The primary endpoint of each study is the change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS10) at Day 28.\n\n**About REL-P11** Relmada acquired the development and commercial rights to a novel psilocybin and derivatives program in July of 2021. Psilocybin has neuroplastogen™ effects that have the potential to ameliorate neurodegenerative conditions. Relmada identified the potential to use low dose psilocybin as a treatment for metabolic diseases and published the data at the American Society for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD 2023). Relmada intends to initiate a Phase 1 study of its proprietary low-dose, modified-release formulation of psilocybin, REL-P11, by YE 2024.\n\n**About Relmada Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nRelmada Therapeutics is a late-stage biotechnology company addressing diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), with a focus on major depressive disorder (MDD).

(the “Company”), along with certain\nstatements that may be made by management of the Company orally in presenting this material, may contain “forward-looking statements.”\nThese statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as “estimate,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “projected” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of\nfuture operating or financial performance or condition. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the Company’s\nmanagement and are subject to significant risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\ndescribed in the forward-looking statements, including potential failure of clinical trial results to demonstrate statistically and/or clinically\nsignificant evidence of efficacy and/or safety, failure of top-line results to accurately reflect the complete results of the trial, failure of the 310\nopen-label study to accurately reflect the results of the ongoing 302 and 304 blinded, randomized and controlled studies, failure to obtain\nregulatory approval of REL-1017 for the treatment of major depressive disorder, failure of the psilocybin program to advance to later stages of\ndevelopment, and the other risk factors described under the heading \"Risk Factors\" set forth in the Company's reports filed with the SEC from\ntime to time. Statements regarding future action, future performance and/or future results, those relating to the timing for completion, and results\nof, scheduled or additional clinical trials and the FDA’s or other regulatory review and/or approval and commercial launch and sales results (if\nany) of the Company’s formulations and products and regulatory filings related to the same may differ from those set forth in the forward-looking\nstatements.
