Power Partner award list received top marks from clients for being instrumental in helping leadership navigate the dynamic world of startups. These B2B partners support entrepreneurs across various facets of the business, including hiring, compliance, infrastructure development, cloud migration, fundraising, etc., allowing founders to focus on their core missions. \"This is our definitive listing of vendors and suppliers who have demonstrated excellence in serving small- and midsize customers,\" says Inc. editor in chief Mike Hofman. \"As part of the vetting process, our team of editors, researchers and reporters gathered information on companies' products and services, assessed their reputation as captured in online comments and forums, and collected customer testimonials to ensure that the sales pitch matches the actual client experience. In every case, we spoke to founders like you who were happy to attest to a vendor's genuine commitment to a mutually beneficial business partnership. We're happy to be the conduit for that positive word of mouth.\"\n\n\"We're honored to be recognized as a provider of some of the best tools that advance entrepreneurs' missions,\" said Allan Thygesen, Docusign Chief Executive Officer. \"Agreements form the foundation of your business, codifying your relationships with partners, customers, and employees. There's so little room for inefficiencies in growing businesses, and we're proud to provide a platform that reduces risks, saves resources, and creates a better experience during every step of the agreement journey.\"\n\nIn 2024, Docusign launched Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM), a new category of AI-powered software that captures the critical business value that's hiding in your agreements.

Stock-based compensation-related charges, including employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions, are impacted by many factors, including the timing of employee stock transactions, the future fair market value of our common stock, and our future hiring and retention needs, all of which are difficult to predict and subject to constant change. We have provided a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in the financial statement tables for our historical non-GAAP financial results included in this release.\n\n**Webcast Conference Call Information**\n\nThe company will host a conference call on September 5, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) to discuss its financial results.

The forward-looking statements made in this press release relate only to events as of the date on which such statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release or to conform such statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly-titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We present these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management view, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. However, these non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results.\n\n**Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share** : We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective GAAP measures, excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, fair value adjustments to strategic investments, acquisition-related expenses, lease-related impairment and lease-related charges, restructuring and other related charges, as these costs are not reflective of ongoing operations and, as applicable, other special items. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. When evaluating the performance of our business and making operating plans, we do not consider these items (for example, when considering the impact of equity award grants, we place a greater emphasis on overall stockholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants). We believe it is useful to exclude these expenses in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies and over multiple periods. In addition to these exclusions, we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non-GAAP net income. We utilize a fixed long-term projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, we have determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 20%.\n\n**Free cash flow** : We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available (if any), after purchases of property and equipment, for operational expenses, investment in our business, and to make acquisitions. Free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash in excess of our capital investments in property and equipment. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth.\n\n**Billings** : We define billings as total revenues plus the change in our contract liabilities and refund liability less contract assets and unbilled accounts receivable in a given period. Billings reflects sales to new customers plus subscription renewals and additional sales to existing customers. Only amounts invoiced to a customer in a given period are included in billings. We believe billings can be used to measure our periodic performance, when taking into consideration the timing aspects of customer renewals, which represents a large component of our business. Given that most of our customers pay in annual installments one year in advance, but we typically recognize a majority of the related revenue ratably over time, we use billings to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers.\n\nFor a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\n\n**DOCUSIGN, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** **(Unaudited)**

          "content": "Q2 FY25 Investor\nPrepared Remarks\nSeptember 5, 2024\nAllan Thygesen, CEO\nBlake Grayson, CFO\nThese prepared remarks should only be viewed together with this quarter's earnings webcast and\npress release. The webcast includes these prepared remarks and a question and answer session. To\naccess the webcast of the executive comments and Q&A session, please visit the IR section of our\nwebsite at investor.docusign.com. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is\nprovided in the tables at the end of this document.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 1\nAllan Thygesen\nCEO\nDocusign drove another quarter of improved stability and greater efficiency\nIntroduction\nwhile introducing the new IAM platform that we believe will be the foundation\nfor future growth. During Q2, revenue was $736 million, up 7% year-over-year\nfor the second consecutive quarter. Dollar net retention was consistent versus\nQ1 at 99%. Continued improvements in customer usage and utilization further\nsupported stability, which Blake will describe in more detail.\nNon-GAAP operating margins increased to 32%, an all-time high and\nsignificant improvement vs. Q2 fiscal ‘24 at 25%. Free cash flow generation\nremained strong, approaching $200 million, resulting in a 27% yield for the\nquarter. This efficiency allowed us to opportunistically allocate capital by\nrepurchasing $200 million worth of shares during Q2.\nOur strong results reflect continued progress across our three strategic pillars:\naccelerating product innovation, evolving omnichannel go-to-market\ncapabilities, and improving operating efficiency.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 2\nProduct Let’s turn to product innovation. In Q2, we shipped the first version of our Intelligent\nInnovation Agreement Management (IAM) platform. This is the most important launch in Docusign’s\nrecent history because of the value we believe IAM will create for our customers. IAM\naddresses the massive $2 trillion in lost economic value each year experienced by\norganizations when managing agreements.\nIn Q2, IAM launched to small and mid-sized commercial customers in the United States,\nCanada, and Australia. It’s very early days, but the initial results and customer feedback\nare promising. So far, IAM customer win rates are higher, average deal sizes are larger, and\ntime to close with customers is faster. Customer deal count and bookings are increasing\nmonth over month, with August being larger than June and July combined. Overall,\npreliminary IAM adoption momentum is tracking as planned, and we look forward to the\ncontinued rollout to additional segments and geographies throughout the rest of the\nfiscal year.\nCustomer feedback captures the value IAM is already delivering, with customers focused\non strong ease of use and fast time to value:\n● Legal service provider Mass Tort Strategies tells us that with IAM, they anticipate\n“saving thousands annually” now that their completed agreements are organized\nand easily searchable.\n● Midwestern healthcare provider Welia Health, said that they were impressed by\nhow quickly they put IAM to use and that, within a few days, they were using\nDocusign Navigator as the organization’s central agreement repository.\nWe’re focused on continuously introducing and enhancing IAM’s value to more customers.\nBefore the end of this fiscal year, we will make IAM available for departmental use within\nlarge enterprise customers, in multiple languages and additional geographies, and for\npurchase via self-serve channels. In 2025, we will unlock moving from department-level\nadoption to organization-wide deployments in large enterprises, add more languages, and\nintroduce more features to escape the agreement trap. Our rollout timeline allows us to\nuse customer feedback to refine our product and go-to-market strategies, ensuring we\nmeet customer needs with a long-term, sustainable approach.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 3\nOmnichannel Let’s turn to the second strategic pillar, our omnichannel go-to-market.\ngo-to-market\nIn Q2, we drove further stabilization in our core business. Overall customer growth\nremained consistent at 11% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, while\nenvelopes sent and contract utilization modestly improved compared to last year. Digital\nand international revenue continued to outpace overall growth and remain large,\nlong-term opportunities. In addition, we are focused on continuing to upgrade and enable\nour sales, partner, and self-serve strategies to sell IAM.\nThe direct salesforce continued to show improved execution. Direct customer growth\nremained strong with a 12% year-over-year increase; and large value customers with over\n$300,000 in ACV saw modest acceleration, benefitting from the impact of our retention\nefforts. CLM continued to outpace overall revenue growth. Lastly, IAM enablement across\nour salesforce was a key priority in Q2. In Q3, the remaining teams in our salesforce will\ncomplete IAM training and certification, including our enterprise-focused teams and\nteams outside the initial launch markets.\nTurning to our other routes to market, this quarter we’re providing more context on the\npartner and self-serve channels where we’ve increased focus and investment.\nIn the partner channel, we've strengthened our strategic relationships with Microsoft, SAP,\nand Salesforce. Our Microsoft collaboration now includes dedicated co-selling through the\nAzure Marketplace and Copilot integrations, driving increased customer volume. We aim to\nbuild similar success with SAP, especially with the newly launched CLM-Ariba integration\nannounced at SAP’s Sapphire events. Also, we continued to partner deeply with\nSalesforce, which remains our largest go-to-market partnership with tens of thousands of\njointly deployed customers. We’ll have more to share about this partnership at their\nDreamforce event in a few weeks.\nImproving our partner and sales channels has led to enterprise customers adopting\nDocusign across a growing set of use cases. A prime example is Canva, the leading online\ndesign and visual communication platform, which has deeply integrated Docusign\nworkflows to support its rapid growth. This quarter, the Microsoft integrations and\nco-selling agreements led to deeper agreements with global banking and insurance\ncustomers as well as with a Fortune 100 retailer. A leading human capital management\nprovider has integrated eSignature functionality directly into its core product offering,\nallowing its customers to drive faster onboarding with new employees. We anticipate\ncontinued partner-enabled usage evolution as IAM rolls out.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 4\nOmnichannel Evolving our self-serve capability has also been an important priority. Over the last 12\ngo-to-market months, we’ve invested in building this infrastructure. Digital revenue growth has outpaced\noverall growth, demonstrating continued positive impact from our focus on e-commerce\nand execution. Our goal is to continuously improve the ability for customers to discover, try,\nuse, and buy our products digitally, further enabling greater scale and efficiency across our\nbusiness.\nToday, new and existing customers worldwide can use our digital platform to more easily\nmove from free trials to paid accounts, upgrade their plans, and expand to additional\nproducts such as ID Verification and SMS Delivery – all without engaging a sales rep.\nWe’ve introduced improved personalization on Docusign.com and integrated new payment\noptions in international markets to improve conversion rates. We expect continued strong\ne-commerce execution and delivery as we expand our digital growth and prepare for\nself-service IAM purchasing.\nClosing We’re excited to welcome new Chief Revenue Officer Paula Hansen and Chief Technology\nOfficer Sagnik Nandy, who’ve both hit the ground running after starting in early August.\nPaula and Sagnik bring large-scale experience selling and building enterprise-customer\nsolutions, and complete an already strong leadership team.\nWe are excited to continue our transformation journey. IAM represents a massive\nopportunity to leverage our market leadership and unlock incredible value for customers\nas the system of record for agreements. We will continue to evolve, remain efficient, and\ninvest for the future.\nThank you to our entire team for bringing the IAM vision to life with our customers. We’re\nproud of what we’ve accomplished, and we’re just getting started.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 5\nBlake Grayson\nCFO\nIntroduction Our Q2 results continue to show stabilization in our core business. Besides the\nresiliency demonstrated by a number of key metrics, we continued to focus on\nbalancing efficiency gains with investment in long-term growth. We achieved\nthat balance in Q2 when we began the launch of our new IAM platform to\ngeneral availability, while producing the highest operating margin in our\ncompany’s history.\nWith regards to IAM, we’ve engaged with a portion of customers over the past\nthree months and we’re encouraged by early traction and customer feedback.\nWe’re in the very early days of both our multi-year transition to IAM, and in\nrealizing our aspiration of re-accelerating our long term growth. I’m excited to\npartner with our team to execute against this strategy.\nBusiness Q2 total revenue of $736 million and subscription revenue of $717 million, both\nStabilization grew 7% year-over-year. Billings were $725 million, up 2% year-over-year. As\nmentioned on last quarter’s call, the growth rate of Q2 billings year-over-year\nwas impacted by last year’s strong on-time renewal performance and the\ntiming impacts of various customer contracts this year. Also, as mentioned\npreviously, we expect Q2 billings growth to be our lowest quarterly growth rate\nin fiscal year 2025.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 6\nBusiness International revenue represented 28% of total revenue and grew at approximately double\nStabilization the rate of our overall revenue. Our global expansion strategy is an important component\nof our long-term vision, and we are optimistic about the continued growth opportunities in\nour international markets. This includes IAM, which will launch in the majority of our direct\ninternational markets by the end of this fiscal year.\nIn addition, investments in our PLG motion continue to deliver results, and in Q2, digital\nrevenue grew at more than double the rate of direct revenue. Specifically concerning PLG,\nwe are improving mechanisms to allow self-service plan upgrades, and our mix of billings\nthis quarter was slightly more weighted to digital than in the prior year.\nStabilizing trends continued from Q1 into Q2 as we saw year-over-year improvements in\nusage, utilization, and customer growth. That momentum underscores the resiliency of our\nbusiness despite continued macro uncertainty.\nDollar net retention rate was 99% in Q2, consistent with Q1. We expect that these recent\nstabilization trends will continue, and we anticipate our dollar net retention rate to remain\nconsistent through the remainder of fiscal year 2025.\nUsage trends continue to show modest improvement. The volume of envelopes sent\nincreased year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, while consumption, a measure\nof utilization, also continued to improve year-over-year, particularly in verticals like\nhealthcare, insurance and technology.\nWe continued to see strong growth and stability in new customer acquisition. In Q2, total\ncustomers again grew by 11% year-over-year to approximately 1.6 million. The continued\nmomentum in overall customer growth gives us confidence that our strategy of both\nself-service and direct sales options is resonating across segments and geographies. The\nunique scale and breadth of our customer base provides a strong foundation for the\nmeasured rollout of the IAM platform.\nThe number of large customers spending over $300k annually increased year-over-year\nand quarter-over-quarter to 1,066 in Q2. Additionally, bookings from customers with total\ncontract value over $1 million continued to grow at a double-digit pace year-over-year.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 7\nFinancial Turning to the financials, our focus on operating efficiency continued to yield strong results\nand this quarter.\noperating\nefficiency\nNon-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was 82.2%, relatively in-line with the prior year.\nWe delivered record-high non-GAAP operating income in Q2 at $237 million, up 40%\nyear-over-year resulting in a 32.2% operating margin, of which approximately 150 basis\npoints was attributable to one-time items associated with professional fees, which\nprimarily consisted of insurance reimbursements and the release of a litigation reserve. Q2\noperating margin was up 750 basis points versus last year and a significant improvement\nover the 18.0% operating margin generated two years ago. Our improvement over the\nprevious year underscores our ability to grow efficiently while continuing to invest in critical\nareas like R&D. We do expect operating margin to decline slightly in the second half of the\nyear as we invest to support our IAM launch and continued rollout, although we still expect\nto exit the year with improving operating margins on a year-over-year basis.\nWe ended Q2 with 6,612 employees vs. 6,748 at this time last year, approximately 2%\nlower, reflecting our disciplined approach to hiring and resource allocation. A measured\napproach to hiring to support our strategic initiatives, including R&D and PLG as well as\nthe Lexion acquisition, drove the quarter-over-quarter increase in headcount.\nIn terms of cash flow, Q2 was another strong quarter. We delivered $198 million of free\ncash flow, a 27% margin which was in line with Q2 of last year. As expected, our free cash\nflow yield moderated from Q1 as we compare against the significant working capital\nimprovements from prior quarters. That said, our collections efficiency remains strong, with\nless than 1% of our accounts receivable over 90 days past due. We expect that the Q3\ncash flow yield will decrease versus Q2, due to the timing of compensation payments and\ninvestments we’re making in the second half of this year. We continue to expect that our\nfiscal year 2025 free cash flow yield will more closely match our full year non-GAAP\noperating margin.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 8\nFinancial Our balance sheet showed continued strength, ending the quarter with $1 billion of cash,\nand cash equivalents, and investments. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Because of the\noperating\nstability in our balance sheet and consistency in free cash flow generation, we can\nefficiency\ncontinue investing in the business and opportunistically return cash to shareholders. In Q2,\nwe accelerated the pace of our buyback activity and repurchased a record $200 million in\nshare value, effectively redeploying 100% of our quarterly free cash flow generation back\nto shareholders. While this rate will fluctuate as we pursue an opportunistic strategy\nbalanced against investment initiatives and the operating environment, we believe this\nactivity further demonstrates our commitment to delivering value to shareholders. We also\nused $39 million in cash to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the dilutive impact\nof our equity programs.\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS for Q2 was $0.97, a $0.25 per share improvement from $0.72 last\nyear. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.26 vs. $0.04 last year. Related to our GAAP financials, as\ndiscussed last quarter, we released a valuation allowance on certain existing deferred tax\nassets. This had a GAAP-only financial impact of decreasing our non-cash tax expense by\napproximately $838 million. Diluted weighted average shares were flat year-over-year at\n208 million shares, as our repurchase activity was weighted towards the latter portion of\nQ2. We are pleased with the improvements in both non-GAAP and GAAP profitability, and\nwe are actively managing the impact of dilution and cost of our equity programs.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 9\nGuidance With that let me turn to guidance.\nFor Q3’25 and fiscal year 2025, we expect:\nTotal revenue of $743 to $747 million in Q3, or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. For\nfiscal year 2025, we expect revenue between $2.940 to $2.952 billion, or a 7% year-over-year\nincrease at the midpoint. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $722 to $726 million in Q3, or a\n6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint, and $2.864 to $2.876 billion for Fiscal 2025, or a 7%\nyear-over-year increase at the midpoint.\nFor billings, we expect $710 to $720 million in Q3 and $2.990 to $3.030 billion for Fiscal 2025. As\ncontinually shown in recent quarters and years, billings are heavily impacted by the timing of\ncustomer renewals, leading to meaningful variability from period to period. This affects both\nyear-over-year and sequential quarter-over-quarter comparisons, with the impact further\namplified by the scale of our book of business.\nWe expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81.0% to 82.0% for Q3 and for Fiscal 2025.\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28.5% to 29.5% for Q3 and 29.0% to 29.5% for Fiscal\n2025. We will continue to focus on driving efficiencies while investing in long-term growth areas like\nproduct innovation.\nWe are revising our guidance to reflect the anticipated impact of our buyback activities on the\nnon-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As a result, the range is now 206 to\n211 million for both Q3 and Fiscal 2025.\nClosing In closing, Q2 marked an important step toward our future with the initial launch of our\nAI-powered, IAM platform into general availability while delivering record non-GAAP operating\nprofit and margins. We delivered another solid quarter of execution against our three strategic\npillars: accelerating product innovation, enhancing our go-to-market initiatives, and strengthening\nour financial and operational efficiency. We remain pleased with our overall performance,\nparticularly the progress we’ve made stabilizing our business, deepening customer relationships,\ndriving profitability, and generating consistent and meaningful free cash flow.\nAs we look ahead we are excited about the opportunities in front of us, particularly with our IAM\nplatform and the rollout to more customer segments and international regions during the\nremainder of this fiscal year. We believe the future is bright for Docusign, and we remain\ncommitted to delivering value to our customers, shareholders, and employees as we continue\nexecuting our long-term vision.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 10\nAppendix\nSafe Harbor This document contains “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to\nmanagement, and which statements involve substantial risk and uncertainties.

These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different\nmeasures and than similarly-titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should\nother key not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nmetrics\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial and\noperational decision-making. We present these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management view, and\nbecause we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods\nwith other companies in our industry. However, these non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to\nour GAAP results.\nNon-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin,\nnon-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share: We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective GAAP measures, excluding\nexpenses related to stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles,\namortization of debt discount and issuance costs, fair value adjustments to strategic investments, acquisition-related expenses, lease-related impairment\nand lease-related charges, restructuring and other related charges, as these costs are not reflective of ongoing operations and, as applicable, other special\nitems. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price and other factors that are beyond\nour control and do not correlate to the operation of the business.\nWhen evaluating the performance of our business and making operating plans, we do not consider these items (for example, when considering the impact\nof equity award grants, we place a greater emphasis on overall stockholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants). We\nbelieve it is useful to exclude these expenses in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of\nour results to those of peer companies and over multiple periods. In addition to these exclusions, we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to\ncalculate non-GAAP net income. We utilize a fixed long-term projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better\nconsistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, we have determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 20%.\nFree cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow\nis an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available (if any), after purchases of property and equipment, for operational expenses, investment in\nour business, and to make acquisitions. Free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash in\nexcess of our capital investments in property and equipment. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong\nbalance sheet and invest in future growth.\nBillings: We define billings as total revenues plus the change in our contract liabilities and refund liability less contract assets and unbilled accounts\nreceivable in a given period. Billings reflects sales to new customers plus subscription renewals and additional sales to existing customers. Only amounts\ninvoiced to a customer in a given period are included in billings. We believe billings can be used to measure our periodic performance, when taking into\nconsideration the timing aspects of customer renewals, which represents a large component of our business. Given that most of our customers pay in\nannual installments one year in advance, but we typically recognize a majority of the related revenue ratably over time, we use billings to measure and\nmonitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided in the tables at the end of\nthis document.\nDocusign Q2’25 Investor Prepared Remarks 12\nThree Months Ended July 31, Six Months Ended July

The forward-looking statements made\nin this press release relate only to events as of the date on which such statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking\nstatements after the date of this press release or to conform such statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be\ndifferent than similarly-titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance\nand should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of\nour past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by our management for financial\nand operational decision-making. We present these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance using a management\nview, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial\n4\nDOCUSIGN, INC.\nperformance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. However, these non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in\nisolation from, a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results.\nNon-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating\nmargin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share: We define these non-GAAP financial measures as the respective GAAP\nmeasures, excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, amortization of acquisition-\nrelated intangibles, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, fair value adjustments to strategic investments, acquisition-related expenses,\nlease-related impairment and lease-related charges, restructuring and other related charges, as these costs are not reflective of ongoing operations and,\nas applicable, other special items. The amount of employer payroll tax-related items on employee stock transactions is dependent on our stock price\nand other factors that are beyond our control and do not correlate to the operation of the business. When evaluating the performance of our business\nand making operating plans, we do not consider these items (for example, when considering the impact of equity award grants, we place a greater\nemphasis on overall stockholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with such grants). We believe it is useful to exclude these\nexpenses in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer\ncompanies and over multiple periods. In addition to these exclusions, we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non-GAAP net\nincome. We utilize a fixed long-term projected tax rate in our computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across\nthe reporting periods. For fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, we have determined the projected non-GAAP tax rate to be 20%.\nFree cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash\nflow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available (if any), after purchases of property and equipment, for operational expenses,\ninvestment in our business, and to make acquisitions. Free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to\ngenerate or use cash in excess of our capital investments in property and equipment. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be\nused to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth.\nBillings: We define billings as total revenues plus the change in our contract liabilities and refund liability less contract assets and unbilled accounts\nreceivable in a given period. Billings reflects sales to new customers plus subscription renewals and additional sales to existing customers. Only\namounts invoiced to a customer in a given period are included in billings. We believe billings can be used to measure our periodic performance, when\ntaking into consideration the timing aspects of customer renewals, which represents a large component of our business. Given that most of our\ncustomers pay in annual installments one year in advance, but we typically recognize a majority of the related revenue ratably over time, we use billings\nto measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers.\nFor a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly

This efficiency allowed us to opportunistically allocate capital by repurchasing $200 million worth\nof shares during Q2.\nOur strong results reflect continued progress across our three strategic pillars: accelerating product\ninnovation, evolving omnichannel go-to-market capabilities, and improving operating efficiency.\nLet’s turn to product innovation.\nIn Q2, we shipped the first version of our Intelligent Agreement Management or IAM platform. This is the\nmost important launch in Docusign’s recent history because of the value we believe IAM will create for our\ncustomers. IAM addresses the massive $2 trillion in lost economic value each year experienced by\norganizations when managing agreements.\nIn Q2, IAM launched to small and mid-sized commercial customers in the United States, Canada, and\nAustralia. It’s very early days, but the initial results and customer feedback are promising. So far, IAM\ncustomer win rates are higher, average deal sizes are larger, and time to close with customers is faster.\nCustomer deal count and bookings are increasing month-over-month, with August being larger than June\nand July combined. Overall, preliminary IAM adoption momentum is tracking as planned and we look\nforward to the continued rollout to additional segments and geographies throughout the rest of the fiscal\nyear.\nCustomer feedback captures the value IAM is already delivering, with customers focused on strong ease\nof use and fast time to value. Legal service provider Mass Tort Strategies tells us that with IAM, they\nanticipate “saving thousands annually” now that their completed agreements are organized and easily\nsearchable. Midwestern healthcare provider Welia Health said that they were impressed by how quickly\nthey put IAM to use and, within a few days, they were using Docusign Navigator as the organization’s\ncentral agreement repository.\nWe’re focused on continuously introducing and enhancing IAM’s value to more customers. Before the end\nof this fiscal year, we will make IAM available for departmental use within large enterprise organizations in\nmultiple languages and additional geographies, and for purchase via self-service channels. In 2025, we will\nunlock moving from department-level adoption to organization-wide deployments in large enterprises, add\nmore languages, and introduce more features to escape the agreement trap. Our rollout timeline allows us\nto use customer feedback to refine our product and go-to-market strategies, ensuring we meet customer\nneeds with a long-term, sustainable approach.\nLet’s turn to the second strategic pillar, our omnichannel go-to-market.\nIn Q2, we drove further stabilization in our core business. Overall customer growth remained consistent at\n11% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, while envelopes sent and contract utilization\nmodestly improved compared to last year. Digital and international revenue continued to outpace overall\ngrowth and remain large, long-term opportunities. In addition, we are focused on continuing to upgrade and\nenable our sales, partner, and self-serve strategies to sell IAM.\nThe direct salesforce continued to show improved execution. Direct customer growth remained strong with\na 12% year-over-year increase, and large value customers with over $300,000 in ACV saw modest\n3\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

CLM also continued to outpace overall\nrevenue growth.\nLastly, IAM enablement across our salesforce was a key priority in Q2. In Q3, the remaining teams in our\nsalesforce will complete IAM training and certification, including our enterprise-focused teams and teams\noutside the initial launch markets.\nTurning to our other routes to market, this quarter we’re providing more context on the partner and self-\nserve channels where we’ve increased focus and investment.\nIn the partner channel, we've strengthened our strategic relationships with Microsoft, SAP, and Salesforce.\nOur Microsoft collaboration now includes dedicated co-selling through the Azure Marketplace and Copilot\nintegrations, driving increased customer volume. We aim to build similar success with SAP, especially with\nthe newly launched CLM-Ariba integration announced at SAP’s Sapphire events. Also, we continue to\npartner deeply with Salesforce, which remains our largest go-to-market partnership with tens of thousands\nof jointly deployed customers. We’ll have more to share about this partnership at their Dreamforce event in\na few weeks.\nImproving our partner and sales channels has led to enterprise customers adopting Docusign across a\ngrowing set of use cases. A prime example is Canva, the leading online design and visual communication\nplatform, which has deeply integrated Docusign workflows to support its rapid growth. This quarter, the\nMicrosoft integrations and co-selling agreements led to deeper agreements with global banking and\ninsurance customers, as well as with a Fortune 100 retailer. And a leading human capital management\nprovider has integrated eSignature functionality directly into its core product offering, allowing its customers\nto drive faster onboarding with new employees. We anticipate continued partner-enabled usage evolution\nas IAM rolls out.\nEvolving our self-service capability has also been an important priority. Over the last 12 months, we’ve\ninvested in building this infrastructure. Digital revenue growth has outpaced overall growth, demonstrating\ncontinued positive impact from our focus on ecommerce and execution. Our goal is to continuously improve\nthe ability for customers to discover, try, use, and buy our products digitally, further enabling greater scale\nand efficiency across our business. Today, new and existing customers worldwide can use our digital\nplatform to more easily move from free trials to paid accounts, upgrade their plans, and expand to additional\nproducts such as ID Verification and SMS Delivery, all without engaging a sales rep.\nWe’ve introduced improved personalization on Docusign.com and integrated new payment options in\ninternational markets to improve conversion rates. We expect continued strong ecommerce execution and\ndelivery as we expand our digital growth and prepare for self-service IAM purchasing.\nWe’re excited to welcome new Chief Revenue Officer Paula Hansen and Chief Technology Officer Sagnik\nNandy, who’ve both hit the ground running after starting in early August. Paula and Sagnik bring large-\nscale experience, selling and building enterprise-customer solutions, and complete an already strong\nleadership team.\nWe are excited to continue our transformation journey. IAM represents a massive opportunity to leverage\nour market leadership and unlock incredible value for our customers as the system of record for\nagreements. We will continue to evolve, remain efficient, and invest for the future.\n4\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

We’re proud of what\nwe’ve accomplished, and we’re just getting started.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Blake.\nBlake Grayson\nThanks, Allan, and good afternoon everyone.\nOur Q2 results continue to show stabilization in our core business. Besides the resiliency demonstrated by\na number of key metrics, we continued to focus on balancing efficiency gains with investment in long-term\ngrowth. We achieved that balance in Q2 when we began the launch of our new IAM platform to general\navailability, while producing the highest operating margin in our company’s history.\nWith regards to IAM, we’ve engaged with a portion of customers over the past three months and we’re\nencouraged by early traction and customer feedback. We’re in the very early days of both our multi-year\ntransition to IAM, and in realizing our aspiration of re-accelerating our long-term growth. I’m excited to\npartner with our team to execute against this strategy.\nQ2 total revenue of $736 million and subscription revenue of $717 million both grew 7% year-over-year.\nBillings were $725 million, up 2% year-over-year. As mentioned on last quarter’s call, the growth rate of Q2\nbillings year-over-year was impacted by last year’s strong on-time renewal performance and the timing\nimpacts of various customer contracts this year. Also, as mentioned previously, we expect Q2 billings\ngrowth to be our lowest quarterly growth rate in fiscal year 2025.\nInternational revenue represented 28% of total revenue and grew at approximately double the rate of our\noverall revenue. Our global expansion strategy is an important component of our long-term vision, and we\nare optimistic about the continued growth opportunities in our international markets. This includes IAM,\nwhich will launch in the majority of our direct international markets by the end of this fiscal year.\nIn addition, investments in our PLG motion continue to deliver results, and in Q2, digital revenue grew at\nmore than double the rate of direct revenue. Specifically concerning PLG, we are improving mechanisms\nto allow self-service plan upgrades, and our mix of billings this quarter was slightly more weighted to digital\nthan in the prior year.\nStabilizing trends continued from Q1 into Q2 as we saw year-over-year improvements in usage, utilization,\nand customer growth. That momentum underscores the resiliency of our business despite continued macro\nuncertainty.\nDollar net retention rate was 99% in Q2, consistent with Q1. We expect that these recent stabilization trends\nwill continue, and we anticipate our dollar net retention rate to remain consistent through the remainder of\nfiscal year 2025.\nUsage trends continue to show modest improvement. The volume of envelopes sent increased year-over-\nyear for the third consecutive quarter, while consumption, a measure of utilization, also continued to\nimprove year-over-year, particularly in verticals like healthcare, insurance and technology.\n5\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

In Q2, total customers again\ngrew by 11% year-over-year to approximately 1.6 million. The continued momentum in overall customer\ngrowth gives us confidence that our strategy of both self-service and direct sales options is resonating\nacross segments and geographies. The unique scale and breadth of our customer base provides a strong\nfoundation for the measured rollout of the IAM platform.\nThe number of large customers spending over $300k annually increased year-over-year and quarter-over-\nquarter to 1,066 in Q2. Additionally, bookings from customers with total contract value over $1 million\ncontinued to grow at a double-digit pace year-over-year.\nTurning to the financials, our focus on operating efficiency continued to yield strong results this quarter.\nNon-GAAP gross margin for Q2 was 82.2%, relatively in line with the prior year.\nWe delivered record-high non-GAAP operating income in Q2 at $237 million, up 40% year-over-year,\nresulting in a 32.2% operating margin of which approximately 150 basis points was attributable to one-time\nitems associated with professional fees, which primarily consisted of insurance reimbursements and the\nrelease of a litigation reserve.\nQ2 operating margin was up 750 basis points versus last year and a significant improvement over the\n18.0% operating margin generated two years ago. Our improvement over the previous year underscores\nour ability to grow efficiently while continuing to invest in critical areas like R&D. We do expect operating\nmargin to decline slightly in the second half of the year as we invest to support our IAM launch and continued\nrollout, although we still expect to exit the year with improving operating margins on a year-over-year basis.\nWe ended Q2 with 6,612 employees vs. 6,748 at this time last year, approximately 2% lower, reflecting our\ndisciplined approach to hiring and resource allocation. A measured approach to hiring to support our\nstrategic initiatives, including R&D and PLG, as well as the Lexion acquisition, drove the quarter-over-\nquarter increase in headcount.\nIn terms of cash flow, Q2 was another strong quarter. We delivered $198 million of free cash flow, a 27%\nmargin which was in line with Q2 of last year. As expected, our free cash flow yield moderated from Q1 as\nwe compare against the significant working capital improvements from prior quarters. That said, our\ncollections efficiency remains strong, with less than 1% of our accounts receivable over 90 days past due.\nWe expect that the Q3 cash flow yield will decrease versus Q2, due to the timing of compensation payments\nand investments we’re making in the second half of this year. We continue to expect that our fiscal year\n2025 free cash flow yield will more closely match our full year non-GAAP operating margin.\nOur balance sheet showed continued strength, ending the quarter with $1 billion of cash, cash equivalents,\nand investments. We have no debt on the balance sheet. Because of the stability in our balance sheet and\nconsistency in free cash flow generation, we can continue investing in the business and opportunistically\nreturn cash to shareholders.\nIn Q2, we accelerated the pace of our buyback activity and repurchased a record $200 million in share\nvalue, effectively redeploying 100% of our quarterly free cash flow generation back to shareholders. While\nthis rate will fluctuate as we pursue an opportunistic strategy balanced against investment initiatives and\nthe operating environment, we believe this activity further demonstrates our commitment to delivering value\n6\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

We also used $39 million in cash to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the\ndilutive impact of our equity programs.\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS for Q2 was $0.97, a $0.25 per share improvement from $0.72 last year. GAAP\ndiluted EPS was $4.26 vs. $0.04 last year.\nRelated to our GAAP financials, as discussed last quarter, we released a valuation allowance on certain\nexisting deferred tax assets. This had a GAAP-only financial impact of decreasing our non-cash tax\nexpense by approximately $838 million. Diluted weighted average shares were flat year-over-year at 208\nmillion shares, as our repurchase activity was weighted towards the latter portion of Q2. We are pleased\nwith the improvements in both non-GAAP and GAAP profitability, and we are actively managing the impact\nof dilution and cost of our equity programs.\nWith that, let me turn to guidance.\nFor Q3’25 and fiscal year ‘25, we expect total revenue of $743 million to $747 million in Q3, or a 6% year-\nover-year increase at the midpoint. For fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue between $2.940 billion to\n$2.952 billion, or a 7% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of\n$722 million to $726 million in Q3, or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint, and $2.864 billion to\n$2.876 billion for fiscal 2025, or a 7% year-over-year increase at the midpoint.\nFor billings, we expect $710 million to $720 million in Q3 and $2.990 billion to $3.030 billion for fiscal 2025.\nAs continually shown in recent quarters and years, billings are heavily impacted by the timing of customer\nrenewals, leading to meaningful variability from period to period. This affects both year-over-year and\nsequential quarter-over-quarter comparisons, with the impact further amplified by the scale of our book of\nbusiness.\nWe expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81.0% to 82.0% for Q3 and for fiscal 2025.\nWe expect non-GAAP operating margin of 28.5% to 29.5% for Q3 and 29.0% to 29.5% for fiscal 2025. We\nwill continue to focus on driving efficiencies while investing in long-term growth areas like product\ninnovation.\nWe are revising our guidance to reflect the anticipated impact of our buyback activities on the non-GAAP\nfully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As a result, the range is now 206 million to 211 million\nfor both Q3 and fiscal 2025.\nIn closing, Q2 marked an important step toward our future with the initial launch of our AI-powered IAM\nplatform into general availability while delivering record non-GAAP operating profit and margins. We\ndelivered another solid quarter of execution against our three strategic pillars: accelerating product\ninnovation, enhancing our go-to-market initiatives, and strengthening our financial and operational\nefficiency. We remain pleased with our overall performance, particularly the progress we’ve made\nstabilizing our business, deepening customer relationships, driving profitability, and generating consistent\nand meaningful free cash flow.\nAs we look ahead we are excited about the opportunities in front of us, particularly with our IAM platform\nand the rollout to more customer segments and international regions during the remainder of this fiscal\nyear.\n7\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

With that, Operator, let’s open up the call for questions.\nOperator\nThank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.\nIf you would like to ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone\nwill indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star, two if you would like to remove your\nquestion from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your\nhandset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions.\nOur first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill\nAllan, you raised your full year guide to 7% growth, but still guiding billings for 3.5%. I think many are asking,\nthinking about your growth aspirations over the medium term, what are the main reasons that are giving\nyou confidence in sustaining that growth? And just for Blake, you mentioned the record margin at 32%.\nEveryone would kind of love to hear what your ceiling is over the next year to two in terms of where you\nthink you can go versus continuing to invest, and can you drive—continue to higher margins while driving\nthat revenue growth? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen\nI’ll go and then you can jump in, Blake.\nOn the growth front, first of all, I think we’re really proud of the progress we’ve made. I think we’ve really\nfully stabilized the current business. You can see the DNR rates both looking backwards and looking ahead.\nWe’ve gotten to a better place. I think a lot of the operating metrics that we shared on the call are trending\nin the right direction as well. So I think on the core eSign business we still have obviously room for\nimprovement and we’re going to keep working at it, but I think we feel we’re in a better place.\nIn terms of accelerating growth, International and CLM will provide some of that in the very short term. In\nlong term, the main growth lever for us is IAM. It’s super early. We just launched to the commercial segment\nin North America and Australia, obviously a subset of our business. But the early indicators are quite\nencouraging. Significantly larger deal sizes, faster closes, higher win rates, accelerating bookings\nmomentum. August is larger than the size of June and July combined and it’s just generally very, very\npositive.\nWith that said, it’s still super early. We’ve got more customer segments and regions to roll out to, but we’re\ncertainly hopeful that that will show up in a more meaningful way that we can discuss with you next year\nand beyond.\nBlake Grayson\n8\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Once you normalize a bit—and I referenced this in the prepared\nremarks—about 150 basis points for one-time items still producing over 30% operating margins. It’s\nsomething where as a team we’ve made a ton of improvement over the last two years as a company here.\nYou look at things like sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue for us was 41%, I think\ntwo years ago; it was 30% for this quarter. So, just a lot of improvement, a lot of focus on productivity and\nefficiency.\nBut to your question about how much more opportunity is there out there for us, the thing that’s most on\nmy mind—and I think I can speak for the leadership team as well—is that balancing this idea of between\nproductivity and growth, and we want to make sure that what we can do is feed this growth engine that we\nare so excited about in IAM and make sure that we get it launched, obviously, in all these different new\nregions that are coming out and new customer segments. And so while I do think there’s opportunity for us\ninto the future for continued efficiency and productivity improvements, I think the bigger focus for us right\nnow is focusing on this growth lever, how we make sure we keep a mindset of productivity but also don’t\nlose sight of that growth engine, because that’s what we’re obviously so excited about. We’ve made a lot\nof progress on efficiency and productivity, so I’m really confident in the team and out abilities there, but it’s\nalso that balance perspective that we’re really focused on.\nBrent Thill\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with\nyour question.\nJake Roberge\nHi. Thanks for taking the questions, and great to hear that win rates are improving and that customer\nbookings are increasing month-over-month for IAM. I’m curious if you could just expand on the early\nfeedback that you’ve been getting from customers for that solution, and then why do you think IAM has\nbeen able to sell so much quicker in its early stages than what CLM previously did?\nAllan Thygesen\nYes, I’ll take that one.\nIn terms of early customer feedback, I think the most important theme is that people are just really thrilled\nwith the ability to collect all of your agreement and get insights from them near instantly. So, both the ease\nof deployment, ease of use and the time to value is really strong, and that resonates with customers really\nacross industries and across functions. There’s a couple of quotes in the earnings release around that.\nA couple of surprising things may provide a little bit more color. Even though we launched into the\ncommercial segment which tends to be smaller, not the smallest but smaller customers, the average\n9\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

That gives us a\nlot of confidence. And we’re seeing pretty rapid adoption once people have signed. They don’t need a lot\nof hand-holding. Then as you know, we have a very ubiquitous product with eSign, 1.6 million customers.\nOur goal with IAM was to provide something that can provide value for all of them and really provide a\ndifferentiated value proposition going forward and the early signs are really encouraging on that front.\nAnd we’re still looking ahead to launching self-serve to get the long tail and then going into the enterprise,\ninitially departmental adoption and, of course, in geographies outside the three launch markets. So, a lot of\nheadroom and scaling for reach of the product as well.\nBut I’d say the mood inside the company is one of sort of optimism and energy and, “Hey, this is really\nworking.” It’s fun.\nJake Roberge\nOkay. Very helpful. Could you just talk about what led to the sales transition during the quarter and if Paula\nhas identified any kind of changes that she wants to make since joining, or if it will be more of a continuation\nof the changes that you’ve been making over the last year or two? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen\nYes. Let me quickly address that.\nLook, I think we’re in a transformation moment. Notwithstanding that I think we’ve built a great product and\nthe indications, early indications are really positive, it’s still a transformation. We’re moving from selling a\nsingular product that’s clear horizontal but has a very repeatable motion to something that’s richer. It’s more\nsolution-oriented, there’s more of a platform aspect and I just thought that finding a leader that I thought\ncould really lead that transformation would be great.\nOur strategy has not changed, however. I just want to emphasize we’re continuing to focus on our three\nroutes to market: our direct channel which will remain the biggest and most important; partners, which we\ntalked a little bit more about in the earnings release. We can chat more about it. And of course, the self-\nserve motion. I think Paula will be a tremendous accelerant and execution leader for that strategy, and she\nhas really hit the ground running. She’s a month in and you would not know it. So, thrilled to have her.\nLet me also just quickly—I don’t think I answered the second part of your question about the difference with\nCLM.\nI think CLM has historically been extremely focused at the top of the house, very large enterprise clients\nbecause they were the only ones who could handle the complexity and the custom development, the\ncustom integration that need to happen. I think we have more customers than other vendors, but even there\nit’s just orders of magnitude smaller in customer count than Signature. I think it’s reflecting of that up front\ncost and tax.\nThere’s also flexibility issues in terms of how easy is it to configure, and then in terms of reach it tends to\nbe a relatively limited number of having specialized users. Obviously your legal team and maybe sales ops\nand purchasing ops. IAM, we could deploy seats to every seller, every buyer, every HR person, every\n10\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

They can see the agreements that are related to them. So in terms of the breadth, it’s just a totally\ndifferent thing.\nNow, with all that said, our CLM product remains our choice for enterprises that are ready for it. It has a lot\nof power and flexibility. It definitely has more features than IAM, and we will continue to sell and support\nthat for the foreseeable future. At some point in the very long run we will—as we replace more and more\nthe pieces of IAM with—of CLM with the IAM underpinnings, things will evolve and that’s the nature of\nthings in enterprise software. But we have a market-leading product in CLM and customers who get a lot\nof value from it and we intend to continue to exploit that.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your\nquestion.\nKylie Towbin\nHi. This is Kylie on for Tyler Radke. My main question is around billings. The revenue guide for the full year\nwas raised while the billings beat and raise was a bit smaller. Just curious if there were any term changes\nthat caused the revenues to be raised more. Also curious if there are any seasonal changes to guidance\nrelative to what you were messaging last quarter. Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen\nBlake, why don’t you take that one?\nBlake Grayson\nSure. Yes, that’s correct. We flowed through the full beat in billings to our full year guide. We flowed through\nthe full beat in revenue and then raised for the full year as well.\nThe driver of the Q2 revenue beat was really just based on timing of bookings. So, bookings essentially\ncame in earlier during the quarter than we expected on average, particularly with some larger deals. Some\nanecdotes—and you’ve heard me talk about higher usage and consumption. We had a few deals, amongst\nmany others, that renewed essentially earlier than we had anticipated in our model. The flowthrough or the\nraise into the back half of the year is really a reflection of us scrubbing that kind of dynamic, looking at it\nand saying, “Oh, we have some tailwind there,” as well relative to our forecast, and so that’s the reflection\nof the raise.\nIt’s not really seasonal or a change in business or things like that because, as you all know, billings can be\npretty sensitive, right, to timing. Those are really the biggest components, but the revenue raise is really\nreflective of the beat in Q2, which is based on timings of bookings.\nOperator\nThank you.

Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on a point\nin the prepared remarks you made about margins coming down in the second half just for some more IAM\ninvestments. I guess I'm just curious what's really missing at this point? Is it just more enterprise\nfunctionality? Or could you just provide some more detail on, I guess, where those dollars are going?\nBlake Grayson\nYes, sure. I think if you normalize the Q2 number after those one-time items, we do have a slight decline in\nabout 150 basis points or so from Q2 into Q3. The IAM investment component, obviously, we're supporting\ntoday primarily a North America CBU business, and we'll be supporting a lot more than that by the end of\nthis fiscal year. So it's really just a reflection, it’s part of its timing. But it's really just a reflection of making\nsure that we're supporting all these other international geographies that have yet to launch, as well as many\nother customer segments within North America as well. But even with that, our Q3 guide on operating\nmargin is still sizably above year-on-year, and so proud of the team and the efficiency on that.\nChris Fountain\nGot it. Thank you, Blake. One quick follow-up, just on the pricing model. How should we think about that\nfor IAM and how it's evolved beyond the kind of historical pricing model? I think in the past you talked about\nmoving more towards a seat-based traditional subscription model. Just any update there would be great.\nAllan Thygesen\nYes. There's a lot of levers there. First, just to frame it. Historically, our Sign business has primarily had an\nenvelope-based billing model, basically the number in documents sent, and you prebought capacity. That\nobviously doesn’t make sense for IAM more broadly, and so we're anchoring it around seat-based pricing\nfor different user types, plus adders (phon) for, shall we say, capacity related to, for example, the number\nof documents stored in the repository, as well as a variety of add-on services, advanced AI features, third-\nparty identification, verification and other value-added features.\nI think we're still exploring other ways in which we can best match our pricing to the value delivered. That's\nwhat you want in the pricing model. I think we've done a pretty good job out of the gate, but I'm sure we'll\nbe learning more here over the next 6 to 12 months as we explore different customer segments and\ngeographies. But that's the high level of how it's working today.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with\nyour question.\nArti Vula\nHey, this is Arti for Mark Murphy. Congrats on the quarter and the milestones, and thanks for taking the\nquestion.\n12\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Could you double click there and just maybe provide a little bit of insight\nas to which types of customers or regions you're prioritizing in the near term? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen\nYes. From a customer segment perspective, if you want to oversimplify, we serve customers of all sizes,\nright? From two-person law firms to 100,000 employee corporations. We launched to the commercial\nsegment, so the mid-market segment stretching down to the upper end of SMB and then here before the\nend of the year, we will launch a pure self-service version so that—or ability to buy IAM purely self-service,\nso that will allow us to reach all the way down, as well as, of course, remove friction for any customer in\nany segment. Then we will begin selling to the enterprise segment. I think initially, it will support mostly\ndepartment level rollout, so roll out for a sales division or for an HR team or whatever. But we think we can\nget going with something pretty robust, and we've had a lot of inbound interest.\nFrom a geography perspective, our primary focus was in the U.S. We also launched a version in Canada\nand Australia. Later this fall, the product will become available, including all the localized AI for—at least in\nAustralia and Canada. We'll also have the U.K., and then for Germany and France. Then the product more\nbroadly without full contract AI will be available worldwide. By the end of this year, any DocuSign customer\nwill be able to buy a version of IAM.\nMaybe just to double-click a little on the AI point, I mentioned how bringing intelligence to the agreements\nthat you have is a key value prop for IAM. That rests on using AI to extract the essential terms out of\ndocuments and which then means you have to train models, for not just for specific languages, but the\nspecific legal systems. The U.K., yes, it's English, but it's a different English and a different legal standard\nthan the U.S. so you need to train those models for each of those markets.\nWe're making very good progress on that. I rattled off the markets that we're serving right off the bat, and\nwe will add several more language and market combination in early next year. But that will be an ongoing\nproject, but important to fully deliver the value in all of our biggest markets.\nArti Vula\nVery helpful and great insight on the regionalization for the AI.\nTurning to your remarks about hiring behind strategic initiatives as well as Lexion kind of contributing to the\nheadcount growth, could you help us maybe size the contribution from Lexion? Just trying to kind of better\nunderstand what the organic headcount growth looks like and maybe also where you're hiring is behind\nthat? Is that in R&D, or sales and marketing, or where are you kind of prioritizing your dollars?\nBlake Grayson\nYes, sure. I'll take the stab at that one, Allan.\nLexion was a pretty fair chunk of our quarter-over-quarter headcount growth. I think we grew about 170\nheads; Lexion is a fair chunk of that. But for the remainder it is primarily focused in areas across the\nCompany that are supporting our growth initiatives. So you can imagine, places in R&D and PLG and other\nareas of the Company as well that support those functions or those initiatives are growing.\n13\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

We are continuing to hire\nin all of our regions. Now, that said, we're also being very mindful about that. We're being mindful of cost\nper location and global time zones and things like that, of that nature. So as we think about headcount\ngrowth, I would also encourage you to make sure you pay attention as well on top to OpEx growth because\nyou'll see a little bit of a differentiation there. Again, I would just reinforce that we're very mindful of being\nproductive and efficient as much as possible as we continue to support the growth opportunity that we see\nin IAM.\nArti Vula\nGreat. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with Citizens JMP. Please proceed\nwith your question.\nPatrick Walravens\nGreat. Thank you and congratulations.\nAllan, can I ask you a big picture question? What's your perspective on sort of the attempts to regulate AI?\nThen particularly here in California, you have the Senate bill that's sitting on Newsom’s desk about safe\nand secure innovation for frontier artificial intelligence models. Does that impact you, and sort of bigger\npicture thoughts would be really helpful.\nAllan Thygesen\nYes. First of all, I'd say we believe that it's very early with AI, and it's hard to regulate something that's not\nwell defined. But I don't believe that any of the currently proposed regulation here or in the EU or elsewhere\nmeaningfully affects our plans. It's probably the most important to get that out of the way.\nIn terms of sort of my observations as a tech industry participant and observer, I do think that there is\nunderstandable concern about the potential for AI to be misused in various ways. I personally believe the\nfirst focus should be on adapting existing regulations for AI, so looking for whether it's discrimination\nprovisions or competition provisions, whatever it is, how can we interpret existing laws and clarify how those\nshould apply in an AI context rather than conceiving things completely de novo.\nBut I'm not an expert on—was it 1047 bill? Obviously, we will adhere to the laws of markets where we\noperate.\nPatrick Walravens\nAwesome. All right, thank you.\nOperator\n14\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with\nyour question.\nArsenije Matovic\nHi. This is Arsenije on for Alex Zukin. Thanks for taking the question. On dollar net retention that has stayed\nstable at 99% and is expected to stay stable, but why is that not expected to expand, as it seems you should\nhave lapped pandemic renewal cohorts going into the second half of this year? And I guess to help investors\ngain visibility into expansion from long customers, what has the dollar retention been for customers outside\nof the pandemic renewal cohort? Then I have just a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nBlake Grayson\nYes, sure. I'll take a stab at that. Again, just to reiterate, dollar net retention flat in Q2 at 99% and indication\nin the prepared remarks that we expect that to stay consistent through the remainder of the year.\nWith regard to the COVID comment, gosh, I think it was on our Q3 fiscal '24 earnings call I believe we\nshared the data point that by the end of fiscal '24, only about 10% of our book of business will be from\ncontracts written during what I call the calendar years 2020 and 2021, it's the proxy for the pandemic, and\nthat will continue to decline in fiscal '25. We're on track for that. We're in the mid-single-digit share for Q2,\nand we expect to be at the very low single-digit share in FY '25 the end. So from an impact to DNR\nperspective, we primarily already flushed through like that impact, generally speaking.\nI think for us, the longer-term opportunities for us to improve DNR rate going forward rest both with\nimproving renewals in our core business, improving those retention rates, and we've shown improvements\nin that to date, but we have more room to go that we can improve on. But then also this opportunity longer\nterm with IAM and that provides us the ability for, I think, a real opportunity for expansion with customers\nbased primarily on the value that we provide to them and customers being willing to share in some of that\nvalue upside.\nThose are the components that I think we're most excited about, but as far as like breaking down cohorts\nof DNR and such, we're through the bulk of our COVID comps already.\nArsenije Matovic\nGot it. Thank you. Then just to clear up, and I guess confirm, last quarter's full year subscription revenue\nguide included Lexion as does guidance today. Is that correct?\nBlake Grayson\nThat's correct. It was included in our guide last quarter.\nArsenije Matovic\nThank you.\nOperator\n15\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Our next question comes from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with\nyour question.\nJosh Baer\nGreat. Thanks for the question. You mentioned higher consumption and envelope volumes and utilization\na couple of times. I'm wondering if you're suggesting that you could start to see customers come back to\nyou to expand contracts for more envelopes. And related, just wondering how much of your business now\nis an all-you-can-eat type of enterprise license agreements, and does the higher consumption and utilization\nhave the same impact, just given maybe the changing mix of contracts versus prior periods? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson\nSure. So with regards to verticals, yes, I think we look at our vertical consumption and envelopes sent as a\nproxy for the opportunity that we see with our customers for expansion over time. But for every customer\nit's going to be different, right? So it's a little challenging to pick a certain rate.\nBut consumption improved pretty well, I would say, on a prior year-over-year basis, and then envelope sent\nalso increased for us on a year-over-year basis. So as customers run through those components and they're\nusing more of the product, they get more excited about it.\nNow, with regards to expansion opportunities—I think you asked about the all-you-can-eat component—\nthat's pretty small for us in our core business. People are buying generally fixed rate envelopes for the most\npart. We have certain deals that don't do it that way, but for the most part it is. So, that actually encourages\nme a little bit for the IAM opportunity that we have because I think it's telling a customer in a way, “Okay,\nyou don't have to worry as much about the consumption side of this and you get these extra features and\na platform essentially that we believe adds so much incremental value for you.” I don't want to say it's an\neasy decision, but you can really see the line of sight there to why you would want people to expand and\nconvert into an IAM situation, and that takes time with our customers.\nWe've got a $3 billion book of business with an average contract length of, I think, 19 months, and so that\ntakes time. But I'm encouraged by the usage and the consumption metrics that we've seen to date.\nJosh Baer\nThat's helpful. Just wondering, do you view the potential for interest rates to move lower as a tailwind for\nyour business, just given the exposure to mortgages and real estate and financial services? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson\nYes. I mean I'll give you my opinion. I think a lot of people on this call probably are better at kind of\nforecasting interest rate kind of impacts on companies and such like that than me. But yes, I would say that\nespecially specifically to the mortgage environment and the real estate environment you talked about, I\nthink anything that drives higher demand for a customer is good for us. If lower interest rates drive more\npeople to either refinance or buy homes and such, I think it's a potential helpful.\n16\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

So, cautiously optimistic. We still think there's opportunities\nin our verticals for improvement, if the macro environment improves for those verticals.\nAllan Thygesen\nI would just add that a lot of people know us from real estate transactions, but it has declined as a\npercentage of our overall business. At this point, we're extremely diversified across industries. So, while we\nwould benefit, it might not be as large a benefit as one might have imagined four or five years ago when\nreal estate was really the killer. I think at this point, we've got such a broad portfolio that it would be nice.\nI'm not saying we wouldn't—we would be very happy to take (inaudible) for a variety of reasons, including\nthat, but it's maybe not as sensitive to that as it was, given our diversification.\nJosh Baer\nHelpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your\nquestion.\nRich Poland\nThis is Rich Poland on for Michael Turrin. Thanks for taking my question. First one, I was wondering if you\ncould tease out some of how meaningful those co-selling or agents with large ISVs could be, and just kind\nof how important that is to the partner motion, especially as you scale the IAM business.\nAllan Thygesen\nYes. I think in terms of the co-selling with the large ISVs, the Microsofts, SAPs of the world, I think it's a\nvery meaningful lever. Particularly in the large enterprises, if you go in with Microsoft and they have an\nexisting Azure commitment that can be very helpful. And of course, we're one of the most horizontal ISVs\nand so map well to them, as an example. I think the partnership with SAP holds great potential and the\nsupply chain optimization piece is something that's really important to enterprises right now. They are very\nkeen to improve the workflows. Things like new vendor onboarding and so on are historically very\ncumbersome and so I think we have a big opportunity there.\nBut I do want to expand the window on partners. So look, those three—Salesforce, SAP and Microsoft—\nget a lot of focus here. We're looking at some of the next tier of folks, You can imagine the names there\nthat also get some decent attention, but I think the bigger unlock for us to complement our own sales efforts\nis really the reseller and system integrators.\nResellers in the markets where we can't reach customers through our direct sales team, obviously, in geos\nwhere we can’t or we can't realistically do that., but even in markets like the U.S., Germany or Japan, where\na lot of customers prefer to buy from a reseller. That's a very important channel.\n17\nViaVid has made considerable efforts to provide an accurate transcription.

Look, I'm very proud of how simple we've made a very complex problem of improving agreement\nworkflows. But when you undertake something of that scale and scope I think there's going to naturally be\nmore opportunities for their size, and they all see that. So we've had a tremendous amount of inbound\ninterest. Historically, most of our SI work has been focused on CLM, which is a small part of our business,\nbut now with IAM really being the whole company, if you will, it's much more strategic, much larger in scope.\nWe have, I think, a huge opportunity to partner better with the Deloittes, the E&Ys, the Capgeminis of the\nworld. There's a lot of that already happening and I think much more to come. That's a big enabler for us.\nRichard Poland\nThank you. That's very helpful. Just as a follow-up, in some of these early IAM deals that you're seeing, I\nknow you talked a little bit about seats and just kind of the potential for that to be a little bit more pervasive\nacross an organization. Are you starting to already see some of those wider seat deployments in an\norganization, maybe like cross departments? Or are you typically starting with one department inside an\norganization and then just kind of expanding from there?\nAllan Thygesen\nYes. I'll just clarify that was for IAM, right?\nThe companies we're deploying now are smaller, and so it's the commercial segment, so it does tend to be\ncompany-wide in many cases. I think as we start our enterprise deployments, it's more likely to be divisional\nand departmental just because the scale and scope and risk and all the systems we'd have to put in to fully\nsupport that. That's a forecast because we're just about to open the doors to the initial selling to the\nenterprise segment, but that would be my guess on how that's going to play out initially.\nBy the way, it's very familiar to us, right, in that that's how eSign rolled out. We went to the heads of sales\nand said, \"Hey, would you like to make your sales process more efficient? \" and they said, \"Yes, please.\"\nThen we integrated with Salesforce and they deployed it in sales, and then purchasing or HR look at that\nand went, “Hmm, can we do that?” And so we've been able to cross-sell in some companies. I think with\nIAM, we'll have more opportunity to do that.\nRichard Poland\nMakes a lot of sense.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ian Black with Needham & Company. Please proceed\nwith your question.\nIan Black\nHi. Thanks for the question. You had a good partner check on the Lexion acquisition. How important is that\nfunctionality to the new IAM platform, and when do you expect the acquisition to be integrated?

Actually, I just want to say how thrilled we are with the Lexion acquisition. We closed the deal at the\nend of May and it was always our intent for this to be principally a product and team acquisition. We put a\nlot of focus on integrating their products, and I'm proud to say that this month we will ship two significant\nfeatures that are directly enabled by the Lexion acquisition. That's four months from when we closed the\ndeal, so huge kudos to the Lexion team and to the Docusign team members that are helping them, and\nthere's more to come. We’ve got a couple of more things that are I think really exciting. And they are dead\ncenter in the vision for IAM. So I think that turned out to be even better than I could have expected and\nwe're thrilled to have the team here. They've got an infusion of entrepreneurial energy and innovation that's\nalways welcome, and I think it's going to help our roadmap on a going-forward basis.\nOperator\nThank you. Our last question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with\nyour question.\nBill\nThis is Bill on for Kirk, and thanks for taking my question. Do you feel like NRR rates have stabilized and\nshould start improving from here? Are there customers still trying to rightsize their spend that could create\ncontinued pressure on that front, or do you feel like you're now at a level where upsell, cross-sell can\noutpace envelope pressure on NRR rate?\nBlake Grayson\nSure. From a DNR perspective, we've seen it stabilize here for a few quarters in a row and we expect that\nto continue through the rest of the year. I'm not giving FY '26 kind of DNR forecast or anything like that, but\nI think what we're showing is that this business has been quite resilient.\nNow, that said, we have aspirations to begin growing this business at a faster clip than we are currently and\nthat's why we’ve talked so much about IAM and things like that, of that nature. I'm encouraged by the\nstabilization trends we've seen, and that we believe that will hold at least through the end of this year. But\nobviously, we are focused on how do we accelerate the growth of this company, doing right by our\ncustomers, providing them extra value and build a really durable platform in the agreement management\nspace? I think we're executing so far quite well against that going forward, and we'll see how that all plays\nout.\nAllan Thygesen\nYes. I would just add ultimately it is our goal to return to double-digit growth. I’m not making a forecast about\nwhen exactly that will happen, but implied in that, given that we already are in 1.6 million companies, we're\nin close to 85% of the Fortune 500 and comparable numbers in other markets, most of our activity is going\nto be upsell to existing customers. Assuming we're successful in accelerating growth, the DNR will move\nup as well. That's our goal.\nBill\nGreat.
