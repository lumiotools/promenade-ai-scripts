(NASDAQ: PRTS), a leading eCommerce provider of automotive parts and accessories, and a premier destination for vehicle repair and maintenance needs, is reporting results for the third quarter ended September 28, 2024. \n\n[ ![CarParts.com logo \\(PRNewsfoto/CarParts.com, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2449535/Carparts_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2449535/Carparts_logo.html)\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Net sales decreased to $144.8 million, down 13% from the year-ago quarter.\n  * Gross profit of $51.0 million vs. $54.8 million.\n  * Gross margin of 35.2%, up from 32.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n  * Net loss was ($10.0) million, or ($0.17) per share, compared to a net loss of ($2.5) million, or ($0.04) per share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of ($1.2) million vs. $3.0 million.\n  * Cash of $38.1 million and no revolver debt.\n  * Our mobile app has cumulative downloads of over 550,000, more than double the number from the beginning of the year.\n  * New semi-automated Las Vegas distribution center fully operational and handling 20% of company volume.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"Over the last 12 months, we have been working on re-platforming carparts.com to increase performance and shorten our development cycles. I'm proud to announce that carparts.com is now on a best-in-class cloud-based infrastructure which allows us to roll out new features faster than ever.\n\nWe have recently rolled out several strategic initiatives, such as our partnership with SimpleTire, offering a full assortment of tires with installation, our new shipping and product protection offering, and VIN lookup that has 30,000 uses in just two weeks. Although we are early in the journey, all these initiatives are seeing take rates and usage higher than anticipated.\n\nAdditionally, we are happy to announce the launch of our eBay store in Canada with a full assortment of mechanical parts. We are leveraging our best-in-class catalog and marketplaces capabilities to capture incremental revenue in this new global market. Early signs are positive, and as we continue to ramp up, we believe it could become a top line revenue driver.\n\nOn the Amazon front, we have recently completed a pilot, leveraging the Amazon fulfillment network to offer a selection of our private label parts. This program offers amazon shoppers our private label products with fast delivery and Prime badging.\n\nOur OE premium brands are up 24% YOY, our European brands are up 23% YOY, and finally, our wholesale commercial sales channel, excluding the impact of our Vegas move, is up mid-single digits\" said David Meniane, CEO. \n\n**Third Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $144.8 million, down 13% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by deliberate price increases to focus on higher value customers, support gross margin expansion, a continued challenging consumer environment in the industry, and one-time impacts from the Crowd Strike issue and hurricanes Helene and Milton in the quarter.\n\nGross profit in the third quarter was $51.0 million compared to $54.8 million in the year-ago quarter, with gross margin increasing 230 basis points to 35.2%, and up sequentially from 33.5% last quarter. This improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by our price increases and lower product costs resulting in expanded product margins, partially offset by unfavorable freight costs.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter were $60.9 million compared to $57.7 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nNet loss in the third quarter was ($10.0) million compared to a net loss of ($2.5) million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was ($1.2) million compared to $3.0 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOn September 28, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $38.1 million and no revolver debt, compared to no revolver debt and a $51.0 million cash balance at prior fiscal year-end December 30, 2023. \n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nDue to the unexpected and continued impact from hurricanes Helene and Milton, the Company is narrowing and lowering our full year net revenue guidance by $5 million to $595 million to $600 million; however, the Company is narrowing our expected gross margin guidance to the high end of the range, from 32%-34% to 33%-34%.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nCarParts.com CEO David Meniane, CFO Ryan Lockwood and COO Michael Huffaker will host a conference call today to discuss the results, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Tuesday, October 29, 2024Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time) Webcast: [www.carparts.com/investor/news-events](http://www.carparts.com/investor/news-events)\n\nTo listen to the live call, please click the link above to access the webcast.

Operating for over 25 years, CarParts.com has established itself as a premier destination for drivers seeking repair and maintenance solutions. Our commitment lies in placing the customer at the forefront of our operations, evident in our easy-to-use, mobile-friendly website and app. With a commitment to affordability and customer satisfaction, CarParts.com simplifies the automotive repair process, aiming to eliminate the uncertainty and stress often associated with vehicle maintenance. Backed by a robust company-operated fulfillment network, we ensure swift delivery of top-quality parts from leading brands to customers across the nation.\n\nAt CarParts.com, our global team is united by a shared vision: Empowering Drivers Along Their Journey.\n\nCarParts.com is headquartered in Torrance, California.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nRegulation G, and other provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We provide \"Adjusted EBITDA\" in this earnings release and on today's scheduled conference call, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA consist of net loss before (a) interest (income) expense, net; (b) income tax provision; (c) depreciation and amortization expense; (d) amortization of intangible assets; (e) share-based compensation expense; (f) workforce transition costs; and (g) distribution center costs. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided below.\n\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and results of operations.\n\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as measures of the Company's operating performance because it assists in comparing the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of stock compensation expense as well as other items that we do not believe are representative of our ongoing operating performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use these non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to evaluate the ongoing operations of companies in our industry.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are all unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\n_This press release contains statements_ _which are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business and its industry, as well as certain assumptions made by the Company. These statements are forward looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Words such as \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"potential,\" \"believes,\" \"predicts,\" \"projects,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"will likely continue\" and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results and financial condition, our potential growth, our ability to innovate, our ability to gain market share, and our ability to expand and improve our product offerings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors._\n\n_Important factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, competitive pressures, our dependence on search engines to attract customers, demand for the Company's products, the online market and channel mix for aftermarket auto parts, the economy in general, increases in commodity and component pricing that would increase the Company's product costs, the operating restrictions in its credit agreement, the weather and any other factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including the Risk Factors contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10–K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10–Q, which are available at www.carparts.com/investor and the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. You are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements in this release and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

(NASDAQ: PRTS), a leading eCommerce provider of automotive parts and accessories, and a premier destination for vehicle repair and maintenance needs, is reporting results for the second quarter ended June 29, 2024. \n\n[ ![CarParts.com logo \\(PRNewsfoto/CarParts.com, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2449535/Carparts_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2449535/Carparts_logo.html)\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Net sales decreased to $144.3 million, down 18% from the year-ago quarter.\n  * Gross profit of $48.4 million vs. $60.4 million, with gross margin of 33.5%.\n  * Net loss was ($8.7) million, or ($0.15) per share, compared to a net loss of ($0.7) million, or ($0.01) per share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of ($0.1) million vs. $6.3 million.\n  * Cash of $34.1 million and no revolver debt.\n  * Total cumulative mobile app downloads of 450,000, more than double the number from the beginning of the year.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"Last quarter we discussed our emphasis on financial discipline and profitability by focusing on driving gross and net margins, accelerating efficiency and effectiveness to quickly deliver improved profitability; and achieving sustainable growth with strong long-term free cash flow.\n\nIn the second quarter, we made significant progress on gross margin and efficiencies, which reinforces our confidence that we're on the right track. We are confident in our roadmap and our opportunity as a leading online retailer in a highly fragmented $400 billion automotive aftermarket market. \n\nIn the first half of the year, we updated our pricing and marketing acquisition strategies to target more profitable customers and generate higher gross margins. As a result, in the second quarter, we saw sequential margin improvement with product margins at 54.0%, up 210 bps from Q1. We expect Q3 to be sequentially higher.\n\nWe are forging on a path that we expect will result in achieving sustainable and significantly positive Adjusted EBITDA next year while working towards achieving a 6-8% Adjusted EBITDA margin and enhanced free cash flow generation in the medium term\" said David Meniane, CEO. \n\n**Second Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\nNet sales in the second quarter of 2024 were $144.3 million, down 18% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by deliberate price increases to drive gross margin expansion combined with softness in consumer demand.\n\nGross profit in the second quarter was $48.4 million compared to $60.4 million, with gross margin decreasing 70 basis points to 33.5%, but up sequentially from 32.4% in the first quarter of 2024. For fiscal year 2024, the Company is focused on driving gross margin expansion. This improvement was primarily driven by price increases and expanded branded gross margins, offset by higher year-over-year freight costs.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the second quarter were $57.1 million compared to $61.3 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nNet loss in the second quarter was ($8.7) million compared to a net loss of ($0.7) million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was ($0.1) million compared to $6.3 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOn June 29, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $34.1 million and no revolver debt, compared to no revolver debt and a $51.0 million cash balance at prior fiscal year-end December 30, 2023. \n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nFor the full year 2024, we are targeting net sales and gross profit to remain within the range we had previously forecasted. The Company expects net sales at the low end in the range of $600 million to $625 million and gross margin to be 33%, plus or minus 100 basis points.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nCarParts.com CEO David Meniane, CFO Ryan Lockwood and COO Michael Huffaker will host a conference call today to discuss the results, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Tuesday, July 30, 2024Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time) Webcast: [www.carparts.com/investor/news-events](https://www.carparts.com/investor/news-events)\n\nTo listen to the live call, please click the link above to access the webcast.

These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and results of operations.\n\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as measures of the Company's operating performance because it assists in comparing the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of stock compensation expense as well as other items that we do not believe are representative of our ongoing operating performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use these non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to evaluate the ongoing operations of companies in our industry.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are all unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\n_This press release contains statements_ _which are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business and its industry, as well as certain assumptions made by the Company.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nCarParts.com, Inc. is a technology-driven eCommerce company dedicated to revolutionizing the way drivers shop for parts. With over\n25 years of operation, CarParts.com serves as an end-to-end solution for automotive repair and maintenance resources, offering a seamless\nonline shopping experience that empowers drivers along every part of their journey.\nWe principally sell our products, identified as stock keeping units (“SKUs”), to individual consumers through our flagship website,\nwww.carparts.com, and online marketplaces. Our easy-to-use, mobile-friendly website and newly launched mobile app provide customers\nwith a comprehensive selection of approximately 1,047,000 SKUs, complete with detailed product descriptions, attributes, and\nphotographs. Utilizing our proprietary product database, we ensure a seamless match between our SKUs and vehicle specifications,\nguaranteeing the right part fitment. We leverage our online sales channel and global supplier relationships to eliminate intermediaries in the\ntraditional auto parts supply chain, enabling us to offer an unparalleled selection of SKUs compared to offline retail competitors.\nEstablished in California in 1995 as an aftermarket auto parts distributor, the Company – then-known as U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc.\n– embarked on a digital transformation journey in 2000, with the launch of our first retail website. Following our reincorporation in\nDelaware in 2006, we expanded our online operations, bolstering our eCommerce network, launching additional websites, refining our\ninternet marketing strategies, and commencing sales on various online marketplaces.\nIn July 2020, we officially rebranded to CarParts.com and consolidated our web presence into one single eCommerce destination. In\nthe third quarter of 2023, we added a mobile app, available on both iOS and Android, enabling our customers to conveniently shop from\ntheir phones. Driven by our commitment to providing unparalleled customer experience, we use world-class design principles and the latest\ntechnology to power our user-friendly website and app. Our vision of “Empowering Drivers Along Their Journey” underscores our mission\nto create a trusted platform that simplifies the historically stressful experience of vehicle maintenance & repair.\nWe have a significant opportunity to become the go-to destination for all automotive repair and maintenance requirements by focusing\non our evolved strategy around: optimizing supply chain management and upgrading logistics, investing in technology, expanding into new\nbusiness lines, and driving year-over-year increases in new customers, all while maintaining our financial discipline approach of evaluating\ninvestments based on their impact on profitability.\nTo this end, we are working to transform our fulfillment center footprint and are opening a new semi-automated facility in Las Vegas,\nNevada, which we expect to reduce last-mile transportation expenses to the West Coast and enhance customer service through expedited\ndelivery. Furthermore, we continuously expand our technological capabilities, product offerings, and service portfolio to stay ahead of\ncompetitive pressures. By investing in new categories, brands, customer types and revenue streams across both premium and value\nsegments, we seek to maximize gross profit and capture a larger market share.\nIn tandem, we have refined our eCommerce experience and marketing strategy, focusing on enhancing the mobile app experience,\nbuilding brand awareness through innovative owned content channels, and fostering direct customer relationships. These efforts aim to\nposition CarParts.com as the ultimate destination for vehicle maintenance knowledge and product purchases, thereby reducing reliance on\nperformance marketing channels and improving customer acquisition efficiency.\nOur corporate website is located at www.carparts.com/investor.\n1\nTable of Contents\nWe report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending on the Saturday nearest the end of December. References to 2023, 2022, and 2021 relate\nto the 52-week fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, the 52-week fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and the 52-week fiscal year ended\nJanuary 1, 2022, respectively.\nOur Products\nWe offer a broad selection of aftermarket auto parts. We continually refine our product offering by introducing new brands and parts\ncategories, while discontinuing low-selling brands and SKUs. We broadly classify our products into three subcategories by function:\nreplacement parts serving the wear and tear and body repair market, hard parts to serve the maintenance and repair market, and\nperformance parts and accessories.\nReplacement Parts. The replacement parts category is primarily comprised of parts for the exterior of an automobile. Our parts in this\ncategory are typically replacement parts for original body parts that have been damaged as a result of a collision or through general wear\nand tear. In addition, we sell an extensive line of mirror products, including one of our own house brands called Kool-Vue®, which are\nmarketed and sold as aftermarket replacement parts and as upgrades to existing parts.\nHard Parts. The hard parts category is comprised of engine and chassis components as well as other mechanical and electrical parts,\nincluding one of our own house brands of aftermarket catalytic converters called Evan Fischer®. These parts serve as replacement parts for\nexisting engine parts and are generally used by professionals and do-it-yourselfers for engine and mechanical maintenance and repair.\nPerformance Parts and Accessories. We offer performance versions of many parts sold in each of the above categories, including parts\nfrom one of our own house brands, JC Whitney®. Performance parts and accessories generally consist of parts that enhance the\nperformance of the automobile, upgrade existing functionality of a specific part or improve the physical appearance or comfort of the\nautomobile.\nOur Sales Channels\nOur sales channels include the online channel and the offline channel.\nOnline Sales Channel. Our online sales channel primarily consists of our flagship, mobile-friendly eCommerce website\nwww.carparts.com, and app. We also sell our products through online marketplaces, including third-party auction sites and shopping\nportals, which provide us with access to additional consumer segments. The majority of our online sales are to individual consumers.\nOffline Sales Channel. We market our products nationwide to auto parts wholesale distributors.\nOur Fulfillment Operations\nWe fulfill customer orders using two primary methods: (1) stock-and-ship, where we take physical delivery of merchandise and store it\nin one of our distribution centers until it is shipped to a customer, and (2) drop-ship, where merchandise is shipped directly to customers\nfrom our suppliers. We believe that the flexibility of fulfilling orders using two different fulfillment methods allows us to offer a broader\nproduct selection, helps optimize product inventory and enhances our overall business profitability.\nStock-and-Ship Fulfillment. Our stock-and-ship products are sourced primarily from manufacturers and other suppliers located in Asia,\nEurope, Mexico, the United States, as well as various other countries, and are stored in one of our distribution centers located in Virginia,\nIllinois, Nevada, Texas or Florida. We also use temporary outside storage and third-party logistics partners from time to time. All products\nreceived into our distribution centers are entered into our inventory management systems, allowing us to closely monitor inventory\navailability. We consider a number of factors in determining which items to stock in our distribution centers, including which products can\nbe purchased at a\n2\nTable of Contents\nmeaningful discount to domestic prices for similar items, which products have historically sold in high volumes, and which products may\nbe out of stock when we attempt to fulfill via drop-ship.\nDrop-Ship Fulfillment. We have developed relationships with several United States-based auto parts distributors that operate their own\ndistribution centers and can deliver products directly to our customers. We internally developed a proprietary distributor selection system,\nAuto-Vend™, which allows us to electronically select multiple vendors for a given order. Auto-Vend™ will attempt to first direct an order\nto one of our warehouses. If the product is not in stock, Auto-Vend™ will process the order to the next appropriate vendor based on\ncustomer location, cost, contractual agreements, and service level history.\nSuppliers\nWe source our products from two primary regions: (1) our house brands product sourced primarily through manufacturers and\ndistributors in the Asia-Pacific region, and (2) our branded product sourced primarily through drop-ship manufacturers and distributors\nlocated in the United States.\nHouse Brands Product. Our house brands suppliers offer products which are generally of the same quality as a branded product while\nbeing less expensive and we believe provide better value for our consumers. We stock-and-ship our house brands products in our\ndistribution centers. We currently have over 76,000 house brands SKUs in our product selection.\nBranded Product. Serving as a stocking distributor for many branded products, we have developed and implemented application\nprogramming interfaces with the majority of our branded, drop ship suppliers that allow us to electronically transmit orders, check\ninventory availability, and receive the shipment tracking information which is easily passed on to our customers. In addition, we are a\nsignificant customer for many of our drop-ship vendors and have long standing relationships and contracts with many of these suppliers.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, three of our drop-ship vendors accounted for approximately 11% of our total product\npurchases. We currently have over 971,000 branded SKUs in our product selection.\nMarketing\nOur online marketing efforts are primarily designed to attract visitors to www.carparts.com, convert visitors into purchasing customers\nand encourage repeat purchases among our existing customer base. We use a variety of marketing methods, including online marketing\nmethods to attract visitors, which include paid search advertising, search engine optimization, affiliate programs, e-mail marketing and\ninclusion in online shopping engines. To convert visitors into paying customers, we periodically run promotions for discounted products.\nWe seek to create cross-selling opportunities by displaying complementary and related products available for sale throughout the\npurchasing process, including bundled kits and sets. We utilize several marketing techniques, including targeted e-mails about specific\nvehicle promotions, to increase customer awareness of our products.\nInternational Operations\nIn April 2007, we established offshore operations in the Philippines. Our offshore operations allow us to access a workforce with the\nnecessary technical skills at a significantly lower cost than comparably experienced U.S.-based professionals. Our offshore operations are\nresponsible for a majority of our website development, catalog management, and back office support. Our offshore operations also house\nour main call center. We also primarily source our house brands product from suppliers in the Asia-Pacific region.\n3\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nThe auto repair information and parts industry is competitive and highly fragmented, with products distributed through multi-tiered\nand overlapping channels. We compete with both online and offline retailers who offer original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”),\naftermarket and private label parts to either the Do-It-Yourself (“DIY”) or Do-It-For-Me (“DIFM”) customer segments. Current or potential\ncompetitors include the following:\n● national auto parts retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Napa Auto Parts, CarQuest, O’Reilly Automotive and\nPep Boys;\n● large online marketplaces such as Amazon.com (“Amazon”) and sellers on eBay;\n● other online retailers of automotive products and auto repair information websites;\n● local independent retailers or niche auto parts retailers;\n● wholesale aftermarket auto parts distributors such as LKQ Corporation; and\n● manufacturers, brand suppliers and other distributors selling online directly to consumers.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our market are helping customers easily find their parts, educating consumers on the\nservice and maintenance of their vehicles, maintaining a proprietary product catalog that maps individual parts to relevant vehicle\napplications, broad product selection and availability, price, knowledgeable customer service, rapid order fulfillment and delivery, and easy\nproduct returns. We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. However, some of our competitors may be larger, may have\nstronger brand recognition or may have access to greater financial, technical and marketing resources or may have been operating longer\nthan we have.\nHuman Capital\nOur ability to recruit, retain, and develop our employees is key to our long-term growth and success. As of December 30, 2023, we had\n1,080 employees in the United States and 615 employees in the Philippines for a total of 1,695 employees. Additionally, we rely on\nindependent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union\nand we consider employee relations to be good.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe strive to build and create a culture where each person feels valued, respected and understood. As of December 30, 2023, the makeup\nof our employees consisted of 39% women and approximately 82% non-white.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe value employee feedback and are committed to collecting regular feedback primarily through employee surveys. In addition, we\nbelieve that offering training and career growth opportunities is valuable for employee engagement and we often have promoted current\nemployees to higher level positions. We also provide competitive compensation and benefits programs that we believe meet the needs of\nour employees.\nHealth and Safety\nWe have implemented, and continue to implement, policies that provide for the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We are\ncommitted to operating in a safe workplace, and have established safety procedures and safety programs at our distribution centers.\nIntellectual Property\n4\nTable of Contents\nOur intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, domain names, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, is an important\npart of our business. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of laws and regulations, in addition to intellectual\nproperty rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, including trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws, together with\ncontractual provisions and technical measures that we have implemented. To protect our trade secrets, we maintain strict control access to\nour proprietary systems and technology, including our platforms and infrastructure environments. We also enter into confidentiality and\ninvention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third\nparties that provide products and services to us.\nWe have current and pending trademarks registered in the United States, including Carparts.com®, Kool-Vue®, JC Whitney®, Evan\nFischer®, SureStop®, TrueDrive®, DriveWire™, and DriveMotive™, amongst others, and we have additional trademark applications\npending in the United States and other jurisdictions.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information\nand the handling of customer complaints and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. The growth and demand for\nonline commerce has and may continue to result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on\nonline companies. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails\nand communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products\nand services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security. In addition, most states have passed laws\nthat prohibit or limit the use of aftermarket auto parts in collision repair work and/or require enhanced disclosure or vehicle owner consent\nbefore using aftermarket auto parts in such repair work and additional legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future.\nThere is also great uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel and\npersonal privacy apply to the Internet and commercial online services. These issues may take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities\nin a number of states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies\nengaged in online commerce, and new state tax regulations may subject us to additional state sales and income taxes. New legislation or\nregulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of\nexisting laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes or regulatory\nrestrictions on our business. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and overall\nfinancial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to\ncomply with these requirements.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our business is somewhat seasonal in nature. It includes many categories, geographies, and channels which may\nexperience seasonality from time to time based on various external factors. Additionally, seasonality may affect our product mix. These\nhistorical seasonality trends could continue, and such trends may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations\nin subsequent periods.\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports\nare available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website located at www.carparts.com/investor as soon as\nreasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThe inclusion of our website address in this report does not include or incorporate by reference into this report any information on our\nwebsite.\n5\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1A.

We do not have any long-term\ncontracts or exclusive agreements with our foreign suppliers that would ensure our ability to acquire the types and quantities of products we\ndesire at acceptable prices and in a timely manner or that would allow us to rely on customary indemnification protection with respect to\nany third-party claims similar to some of our U.S. suppliers.\nIn addition, because many of our suppliers are outside of the United States, additional factors could interrupt our relationships or affect\nour ability to acquire the necessary products on acceptable terms, including:\n● political, social and economic instability, and the risk of war or other international incidents in Asia, Europe, or abroad,\nincluding, but not limited to, the effects of disputes between China and Taiwan and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine;\n● fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may increase our cost of products;\n● imposition of duties, taxes, tariffs or other charges on imports;\n● difficulties in complying with import and export laws, regulatory requirements and restrictions;\n● natural disasters and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics, impacting\ncountries from which we purchase product;\n● import shipping delays resulting from foreign or domestic labor shortages, slow-downs, or stoppage; and\n● the failure of local laws to provide a sufficient degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property;\n● imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas or other restrictions that may limit the quantity of our product that may\nbe imported into the U.S. from countries or regions where we do business;\n● financial or political instability in any of the countries in which our product is manufactured;\n● potential recalls or cancellations of orders for any product that does not meet our quality standards;\n● disruption of imports by labor disputes or strikes and local business practices;\n8\nTable of Contents\n● political or military conflict involving the U.S. or any country in which our suppliers are located, which could cause a delay\nin the transportation of our products, an increase in transportation costs and additional risk to product being damaged and\ndelivered on time;\n● heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough\ninspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;\n● inability of our non-U.S. suppliers to obtain adequate credit or access liquidity to finance their operations; and\n● our ability to enforce any agreements with our foreign suppliers.\nFor example, during the first quarter of 2018, the United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) imposed an enhanced bonding\nrequirement on the Company at a level equivalent to three times the commercial invoice value of each shipment. While the Company had\nbeen granted relief removing the bonding requirement, CBP may impose other requirements on the Company which would make it more\ndifficult or more expensive for the Company to import products. If we were unable to import products from China and Taiwan or were\nunable to import products from China and Taiwan in a cost-effective manner, we could suffer irreparable harm to our business and be\nrequired to significantly curtail our operations, file for bankruptcy or cease operations.\nFrom time to time, we may also have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights with foreign\nsuppliers. However, it may be more difficult to evaluate the level of legal protection we enjoy in Taiwan and China and the corresponding\noutcome of any administrative or court proceedings than in comparison to our suppliers in the United States.\nWe depend on third-party delivery services, for both inbound and outbound shipping, to deliver our products to our distribution centers\nand subsequently to our customers on a timely and consistent basis, and any deterioration in our relationship with any one of these\nthird parties or increases in the fees that they charge could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and financial\ncondition.\nWe rely on third parties for the shipment of our products, both inbound and outbound shipping logistics, and we cannot be sure that\nthese relationships will continue on terms favorable to us, or at all. Shipping costs have increased from time to time, and may continue to\nincrease due to inflation or other reasons, and we may not be able to pass these costs directly to our customers. Any increased shipping\ncosts could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our costs of doing business and\nreducing gross margins which could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, we utilize a variety of shipping methods for both\ninbound and outbound logistics. For inbound logistics, we rely on trucking and ocean carriers and any increases in fees that they charge\ncould adversely affect our business and financial condition. For outbound logistics, we rely on ‘‘Less-than-Truckload’’ (‘‘LTL’’) and parcel\nfreight based upon the product and quantities being shipped and customer delivery requirements. These outbound freight costs have\nincreased on a year-over-year basis and may continue to increase in the future. We also ship a number of oversized auto parts which may\ntrigger additional shipping costs by third-party delivery services. Any increases in fees or any increased use of LTL would increase our\nshipping costs which could negatively affect our operating results.\nIn addition, if our relationships with these third parties are terminated or impaired, or if these third parties are unable to deliver\nproducts for us, whether due to labor shortage, slow down or stoppage, deteriorating financial or business condition, responses to terrorist\nattacks or for any other reason, we would be required to use alternative carriers for the shipment of products to our customers. Changing\ncarriers could have a negative effect on our business and operating results due to reduced visibility of order status and package tracking and\ndelays in order processing and product delivery, and we may be unable to engage alternative carriers on a timely basis, upon terms\nfavorable to us, or at all.\n9\nTable of Contents\nHigher wage costs due to changes in federal and state minimum wage laws, or due to unstable market conditions, could adversely affect\nour business.\nChanges in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage\nand benefit costs. Increased labor costs brought about by changes in minimum wage laws, inflation, other regulations or prevailing market\nconditions could increase our expenses and have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nIf commodity prices such as fuel, plastic and steel increase, our margins may be negatively impacted.\nOur third-party delivery services have increased fuel surcharges from time to time, and such increases negatively impact our margins,\nas we are generally unable to pass all of these costs directly to consumers. Increasing prices in the component materials for the parts we sell\nmay impact the availability, the quality and the price of our products, as suppliers search for alternatives to existing materials and increase\nthe prices they charge. We cannot ensure that we can recover all the increased costs through price increases, and our suppliers may not\ncontinue to provide the consistent quality of product as they may substitute lower cost materials to maintain pricing levels, all of which\nmay have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nPurchasers of aftermarket auto parts may not choose to shop online, which would prevent us from acquiring new customers who are\nnecessary to the growth of our business.\nThe online market for aftermarket auto parts is less developed than the online market for many other business and consumer products,\nand currently represents only a small part of the overall aftermarket auto parts market. Our success will depend in part on our ability to\nattract new customers and to convert customers who have historically purchased auto parts through traditional retail and wholesale\noperations. Specific factors that could discourage or prevent prospective customers from purchasing from us include:\n● concerns about buying auto parts without face-to-face interaction with sales personnel;\n● the inability to physically handle, examine and compare products;\n● delivery time associated with Internet orders;\n● concerns about the security of online transactions and the privacy of personal information;\n● delayed shipments or shipments of incorrect or damaged products;\n● increased shipping costs; and\n● the inconvenience associated with returning or exchanging items purchased online.\nIf the online market for auto parts does not gain widespread acceptance, our sales may decline and our business and financial results\nmay suffer.\nShifting online consumer behavior of purchasers of aftermarket auto parts could adversely impact our financial results and the growth\nof our business.\nShifting consumer behavior indicates that our customers are becoming more inclined to shop for aftermarket auto parts through their\nmobile devices. Mobile customers exhibit different behaviors than our more traditional desktop based eCommerce customers. User\nsophistication and technological advances have increased consumer expectations around the user experience on mobile devices, including\nspeed of response, functionality, product availability, security, and ease of use. If we are unable to continue to adapt our mobile device\nshopping experience from desktop based online shopping\n10\nTable of Contents\nin ways that improve our customer’s mobile experience and increase the engagement of our mobile customers our sales may decline and\nour business and financial results may suffer.\nIn addition, recent trends indicate that customers may be more inclined to shop for aftermarket auto parts through marketplace\nwebsites such as Amazon and eBay as opposed to purchasing parts through eCommerce channels. Any mix shift in sales to marketplace\nchannels or increase in associated commissions and costs, could result in lower gross margins, and as a result, our business and financial\nresults may suffer.\nIf the hosts of third-party marketplaces limit our access to such marketplaces, our operations and financial results will be adversely\naffected.\nThird-party marketplaces account for a significant portion of our revenues. Our sales on third-party marketplaces (including eBay and\nAmazon) represented a combined 35.6% of total sales in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023. We anticipate that sales of our products\non third-party marketplaces will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. In the future, the loss of access to these third-\nparty marketplaces, or any significant cost increases from operating on the marketplaces, could significantly reduce our revenues, and the\nsuccess of our business depends partly on continued access to these third-party marketplaces. Our relationships with our third-party\nmarketplace providers could deteriorate as a result of a variety of factors, such as if they become concerned about our ability to deliver\nquality products on a timely basis or to protect a third-party’s intellectual property. In addition, third-party marketplace providers could\nprohibit our access to these marketplaces if we are not able to meet the applicable required terms of use. Loss of access to a marketplace\nchannel could result in lower sales, and as a result, our business and financial results may suffer.\nA prolonged future outbreak from COVID-19, or another pandemic and its effects, potentially could affect future years.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, negative impacts on economic conditions in the United States and\nworldwide. A public health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact our business, distribution centers,\ncustomers, suppliers, employees and third party shipping providers. We have incurred in the past, and may in the future incur, additional\nfreight and container costs and may also continue to incur increased costs relating to workforce shortages, overtime charges, and detention\ncosts at one or more of our distribution center. Prolonged effects of COVID-19, or a future pandemic, could also potentially disrupt our\noperations through, but not limited to, shipping container shortages, transportation delays, and changes in our operating procedures,\nincluding the need for additional cleaning and safety protocols.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we recorded a net loss, and our net losses may continue in the future.\nIf our net losses continue in the future, they could severely impact our liquidity, as we may not be able to provide positive cash flows\nfrom operations in order to meet our working capital requirements. We may need to borrow additional funds from our asset-based revolving\ncredit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”), which under certain circumstances may not be\navailable, sell additional assets or seek additional equity or additional debt financing in the future. In such case, there can be no assurance\nthat we would be able to raise such additional financing or engage in such asset sales on acceptable terms, or at all. If our net losses were to\ncontinue, and if we are not able to raise adequate additional financing or proceeds from asset sales to continue to fund our ongoing\noperations, we will need to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure or significantly curtail our operations,\nfile for bankruptcy or cease operations.\nOur operations are restricted by our credit agreement, and our ability to borrow funds under our Credit Facility is subject to a\nborrowing base.\nWe maintain a Credit Facility that provides for, among other things, a revolving commitment in an aggregate principal amount of up to\n$75,000 subject to a borrowing base derived from certain of our receivables, inventory and property and equipment. Our Credit Facility\nalso provides for an option to increase the aggregate principal amount from\n11\nTable of Contents\n$75,000 to $150,000, subject to certain terms and conditions. Our credit agreement with JPMorgan originally entered into on April 26,\n2012 (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) includes a number of restrictive covenants. These covenants could impair our financing and\noperational flexibility and make it difficult for us to react to market conditions and satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash\nrequirements. Specifically, such covenants restrict our ability and, if applicable, the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n● incur additional debt;\n● make certain investments and acquisitions;\n● enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n● use assets as security in other transactions;\n● pay dividends on our capital stock or repurchase our equity interests;\n● sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n● guarantee the debts of others;\n● enter into new lines of business;\n● pay or amend our subordinated debt; and\n● form any subsidiary investments.\nIn addition, our Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base derived from certain of our receivables, inventory, property and\nequipment. In the event that components of the borrowing base are adversely affected for any reason, including adverse market conditions\nor downturns in general economic conditions, we could be restricted in the amount of funds we can borrow under the Credit Facility.\nFurthermore, in the event that components of the borrowing base decrease to a level below the amount of loans then-outstanding under the\nCredit Facility, we could be required to immediately repay loans to the extent of such shortfall. If any of these events were to occur, it could\nseverely impact our liquidity and capital resources, limit our ability to operate our business and could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nUnder certain circumstances, our Credit Agreement may also require us to satisfy a financial covenant, which could limit our ability to\nreact to market conditions or satisfy extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise impact our liquidity and capital resources, restrict our\nfinancing and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. If\nwe are unable to satisfy the financial covenants and tests at any time and unable to obtain waivers from our lenders with respect to such\nrequirements, we may not be able to borrow under the Credit Facility or may be required to immediately repay loans under the Credit\nFacility, and our liquidity and capital resources and ability to operate our business could be severely impacted, which would have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In those events, we may need to sell assets or seek additional equity or\nadditional debt financing or attempt to modify our existing Credit Agreement. There can be no assurance that we would be able to raise\nsuch additional financing or engage in such asset sales on acceptable terms, or at all, or that we would be able to modify our existing Credit\nAgreement.\n12\nTable of Contents\nWhile we did not have any outstanding revolver loan debt under our Credit Agreement as of December 30, 2023, we may have\noutstanding revolver loan debt in the future. Any outstanding indebtedness would have important consequences, including the following:\n● we would have to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to making payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the\navailability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n● certain levels of indebtedness may make us less attractive to potential acquirers or acquisition targets;\n● certain levels of indebtedness may limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions, and make us\nmore vulnerable to downturns in general economic conditions as compared to competitors that may be less leveraged; and\n● as described in more detail above, the documents providing for our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that may limit\nour financing and operational flexibility.\nFurthermore, our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations depends, among other things, upon fluctuations in interest rates, our\nfuture operating performance and ability to refinance indebtedness when and if necessary. These factors depend partly on economic,\nfinancial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. In addition, borrowings under our revolver use a Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (“SOFR”) as one benchmark for establishing the interest rate.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt service obligations as well as fund necessary capital\nexpenditures and general operating expenses. In addition, if we need to refinance our debt, or obtain additional debt financing or sell assets\nor equity to satisfy our debt service obligations, we may not be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If this were to\noccur, we may need to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure or significantly curtail our operations, file for\nbankruptcy or cease operations. The Company’s outstanding letters of credit balance as of December 30, 2023 was $680, and we had $0 of\nour trade letters of credit outstanding in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheet.\nIf our assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may\nnot be recoverable. Factors that may be considered are changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our assets may not be\nrecoverable include a decrease in future cash flows. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial\nstatements during the period in which any impairment of our assets is determined, resulting in an impact on our results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon key suppliers and an interruption in such relationships or our ability to obtain parts from such suppliers\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur top ten suppliers represented approximately 52% of our total product purchases during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\nOur ability to acquire products from our suppliers in amounts and on terms acceptable to us is dependent upon a number of factors that\ncould affect our suppliers and which are beyond our control. For example, financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers\nmay face could result in an increase in the cost of the products we purchase from them. If we do not maintain our relationships with our\nexisting suppliers or develop relationships with new suppliers on acceptable commercial terms, we may not be able to continue to offer a\nbroad selection of merchandise at competitive prices and, as a result, we could lose customers and our sales could decline.\nFor a number of the products that we sell, we outsource the distribution and fulfillment operation and are dependent on certain drop-\nship suppliers to manage inventory, process orders and distribute those products to our customers in a timely manner. For the fiscal year\nended December 30, 2023, our product purchases from three drop-ship suppliers\n13\nTable of Contents\nrepresented approximately 11% of our total product purchases. Because we outsource to suppliers a number of these traditional retail\nfunctions relating to those products, we have limited control over how and when orders are fulfilled. We also have limited control over the\nproducts that our suppliers purchase or keep in stock. Our suppliers may not accurately forecast the products that will be in high demand or\nthey may allocate popular products to other resellers, resulting in the unavailability of certain products for delivery to our customers. Any\ninability to offer a broad array of products at competitive prices and any failure to deliver those products to our customers in a timely and\naccurate manner may damage our reputation and brand and could cause us to lose customers and our sales could decline.\nIn addition, the increasing consolidation among auto parts suppliers may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers, result in\nproduct shortages and/or lead to less competition and, consequently, higher prices. Furthermore, as part of our routine business, suppliers\nextend credit to us in connection with our purchase of their products. In the future, our suppliers may limit the amount of credit they are\nwilling to extend to us in connection with our purchase of their products. If this were to occur, it could impair our ability to acquire the\ntypes and quantities of products that we desire from the applicable suppliers on acceptable terms, severely impact our liquidity and capital\nresources, limit our ability to operate our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nIf we are unable to manage the challenges associated with our international operations, the growth of our business could be limited and\nour business could suffer.\nWe maintain international business operations in the Philippines. This international operation includes development and maintenance\nof our websites, our main call center, and sales and back office support services. We are subject to a number of risks and challenges that\nspecifically relate to our international operations. Our international operations may not be successful if we are unable to meet and\novercome these challenges, which could limit the growth of our business and may have an adverse effect on our business and operating\nresults. These risks and challenges include:\n● difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, including any impairment to our relationship with\nemployees caused by a reduction in force;\n● restrictions imposed by local labor practices and laws on our business and operations;\n● exposure to different business practices and legal standards;\n● unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n● the imposition of government controls and restrictions;\n● political, social and economic instability and the risk of war, terrorist activities or other international incidents;\n● the failure of telecommunications and connectivity infrastructure;\n● natural disasters and public health emergencies;\n● potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n● fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and relative weakness in the U.S. dollar.\nIf our fulfillment operations are interrupted for any significant period of time or are not sufficient to accommodate increased demand,\nour sales could decline and our reputation could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to successfully receive and fulfill orders and to promptly deliver our products to our customers. The\nmajority of orders for our auto parts products are filled from our inventory in our distribution centers, where all our inventory management,\npackaging, labeling and product return processes are performed. Increased demand\n14\nTable of Contents\nand other considerations may require us to expand our distribution centers or transfer our fulfillment operations to larger or other facilities\nin the future. If we do not successfully expand our fulfillment capabilities in response to increases in demand, our sales could decline.\nIn addition, our distribution centers are susceptible to damage or interruption from human error, fire, flood, power loss,\ntelecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, break-ins, earthquakes and similar events. We do not currently maintain back-up\npower systems at our fulfillment centers. We do not presently have a formal disaster recovery plan and our business interruption insurance\nmay be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur in the event operations at our fulfillment center are interrupted. In addition,\nalternative arrangements may not be available, or if they are available, may increase the cost of fulfillment. Any interruptions in our\nfulfillment operations for any significant period of time, including interruptions resulting from the expansion of our existing facilities or the\ntransfer of operations to a new facility, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of\noperations.\nWe face intense competition and operate in an industry with limited barriers to entry, and some of our competitors may have greater\nresources than us and may be better positioned to capitalize on the growing eCommerce auto parts market.\nThe auto parts industry is competitive and highly fragmented, with products distributed through multi-tiered and overlapping channels.\nWe compete with both online and offline retailers who offer OEM and aftermarket auto parts to either the DIY or DIFM customer\nsegments. Current or potential competitors include the following:\n● national auto parts retailers such as Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone, Napa Auto Parts, CarQuest, O’Reilly Automotive and\nPep Boys;\n● large online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay;\n● other online retailers of automotive products websites;\n● local independent retailers or niche auto parts online retailers;\n● wholesale aftermarket auto parts distributors such as LKQ Corporation; and\n● manufacturers, brand suppliers and other distributors selling online directly to customers.\nBarriers to entry are low, and current and new competitors can launch websites at a relatively low cost. Many of our current and\npotential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial,\nmarketing, technical, management and other resources than we do. For example, in the event that online marketplace companies such as\nAmazon or eBay, who have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we do, focus more of\ntheir resources on competing in the aftermarket auto parts market, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations. In addition, some of our competitors have used and may continue to use aggressive pricing tactics and devote substantially\nmore financial resources to website and system development than we do. We expect that competition will further intensify in the future as\nInternet use and online commerce continue to grow worldwide. Increased competition may result in reduced sales, lower operating\nmargins, reduced profitability, loss of market share and diminished brand recognition.\nAdditionally, we have experienced significant competitive pressure from certain of our suppliers who are now selling their products\ndirectly to customers. Since our suppliers have access to merchandise at very low costs, they can sell products at lower prices and maintain\nhigher gross margins on their product sales than we can. Our financial results have been negatively impacted by direct sales from our\nsuppliers to our current and potential customers, and our total number of orders and average order value may decline due to increased\ncompetition. Continued competition from our suppliers may also continue to negatively impact our business and results of operations,\nincluding through reduced sales, lower operating margins, reduced profitability, loss of market share and diminished brand recognition. We\nhave\n15\nTable of Contents\nimplemented and will continue to implement several strategies to attempt to overcome the challenges created by our suppliers selling\ndirectly to our customers and potential customers, including optimizing our pricing, continuing to increase our mix of house brands\nproducts and improving our websites, which may not be successful. If these strategies are not successful, our operating results and financial\nconditions could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to offer a broad selection of products at competitive prices or fail to maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demands,\nour revenue could decline.\nIn order to expand our business, we must successfully offer, on a continuous basis, a broad selection of auto parts that meet the needs\nof our customers, including by being the first to market with new SKUs. Our auto parts are used by consumers for a variety of purposes,\nincluding repair, performance, improved aesthetics and functionality. In addition, to be successful, our product offerings must be broad and\ndeep in scope, competitively priced, well-made, innovative and attractive to a wide range of consumers. We cannot predict with certainty\nthat we will be successful in offering products that meet all of these requirements. Moreover, even if we offer a broad selection of products\nat competitive prices, we must maintain sufficient in-stock inventory to meet consumer demand. If our product offerings fail to satisfy our\ncustomers’ requirements or respond to changes in customer preferences or we otherwise fail to maintain sufficient in-stock inventory, our\nrevenue could decline.\nWe rely on key personnel and may need additional personnel for the success and growth of our business.\nOur business is largely dependent on the personal efforts and abilities of highly skilled executive, technical, managerial,\nmerchandising, marketing, and call center personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure that we will be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining such personnel. The loss of any key employee or our inability to attract or retain other qualified\nemployees could harm our business and results of operations.\nAs a result of our international operations, we have foreign exchange risk.\nOur purchases of auto parts from our Asian suppliers are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, a change in the foreign currency\nexchange rates could impact our product costs over time. Our financial reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and changes in exchange rates\nsignificantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. dollar weakens year-over-year relative to\ncurrencies in our international locations, our consolidated gross profit and operating expenses would be higher than if currencies had\nremained constant. Similarly, our operating expenses in the Philippines are generally paid in Philippine Pesos, and as the exchange rate\nfluctuates, it could adversely impact our operating results.\nIf our product catalog database is stolen, misappropriated or damaged, or if a competitor is able to create a substantially similar catalog\nwithout infringing our rights, then we may lose an important competitive advantage.\nWe have invested significant resources and time to build and maintain our product catalog, which is maintained in the form of an\nelectronic database, which maps SKUs to relevant product applications based on vehicle makes, models and years. We believe that our\nproduct catalog provides us with an important competitive advantage in both driving traffic to our websites and converting that traffic to\nrevenue by enabling customers to quickly locate the products they require. We cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our product\ncatalog from unauthorized copying or theft or that our product catalog will continue to operate adequately, without any technological\nchallenges. In addition, it is possible that a competitor could develop a catalog or database that is similar to or more comprehensive than\nours, without infringing our rights. In the event our product catalog is damaged or is stolen, copied or otherwise replicated to compete with\nus, whether lawfully or not, we may lose an important competitive advantage and our business could be harmed.\n16\nTable of Contents\nEconomic conditions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the demand for aftermarket auto parts and could\nadversely affect our sales and operating results.\nWe sell aftermarket auto parts consisting of replacement parts, hard parts, and performance parts. Demand for our products has been\nand may continue to be adversely affected by general economic conditions, unemployment levels, inflation, rising interest rates from the\nU.S. Federal Reserve as a response to inflation, or other heightened cost pressures on consumers. In declining economies, consumers often\ndefer regular vehicle maintenance and may forego purchases of nonessential performance and accessories products, which can result in a\ndecrease in demand for auto parts in general. Consumers also defer purchases of new vehicles, which immediately impacts performance\nparts and accessories, which are generally purchased in the first six months of a vehicle’s lifespan. In addition, during economic downturns\nsome competitors may become more aggressive in their pricing practices, which would adversely impact our gross margin and could cause\nlarge fluctuations in our stock price. Certain suppliers may exit the industry which may impact our ability to procure parts and may\nadversely impact gross margin as the remaining suppliers increase prices to take advantage of limited competition.\nThe seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations.\nOur business is somewhat seasonal in nature. It includes many categories, geographies, and channels which may experience\nseasonality from time to time based on various external factors. Additionally, seasonality may affect our product mix. We also have\nexperienced increased demand following the issuance of tax rebates by the government. These historical seasonality trends could continue,\nand such trends may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations in subsequent periods. If we do not stock\nor restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet increased customer demand, it could significantly affect our\nrevenue and our future growth. Likewise, if we overstock products in anticipation of increased demand, we may be required to take\nsignificant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability.\nVehicle miles driven, vehicle accident rates and insurance companies’ willingness to accept a variety of types of replacement parts in the\nrepair process have fluctuated and may decrease, which could result in a decline of our revenues and negatively affect our results of\noperations.\nWe and our industry depend on the number of vehicle miles driven, vehicle accident rates and insurance companies’ willingness to\naccept a variety of types of replacement parts in the repair process. Decreased miles driven reduce the number of accidents and\ncorresponding demand for crash parts, and reduce the wear and tear on vehicles with a corresponding reduction in demand for vehicle\nrepairs and replacement or hard parts. If consumers were to drive less in the future and/or accident rates were to decline, as a result of\nhigher gas prices, increased use of ride-shares, the advancement of driver assistance technologies, or otherwise, our sales may decline and\nour business and financial results may suffer.\nWe may be required to collect and pay more sales taxes, and could become liable for other fees and penalties, which could have an\nadverse effect on our business.\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair (“Wayfair”), online sellers can be required to collect sales tax in any\nstate which passes legislation requiring out of state retailers to collect sales tax even where they have no physical nexus. In response to\nWayfair, or otherwise, state or local governments and taxing authorities may adopt, or begin to enforce, laws requiring us to calculate,\ncollect and remit taxes on sales in their jurisdictions, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nMoreover, if we fail to collect and remit or pay required sales or other taxes in a jurisdiction, or qualify or register to do business in a\njurisdiction that requires us to do so or if we have failed to do so in the past, we could face material liabilities for taxes, fees, interest and\npenalties.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income may be limited.\n17\nTable of Contents\nUnder legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), federal net operating losses (“NOLs”)\nincurred in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs\ngenerated in tax years beginning before December 31, 2017, is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to\nthe Tax Act. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and corresponding\nprovisions of state law, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in\nits equity ownership over a three-year period) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards\nto offset post-ownership change income. We may in the future experience ownership changes, and thus, our ability to utilize pre-ownership\nchange NOL carryforwards to offset post-ownership change income may be limited. Such limitations may cause a portion of our NOL\ncarryforwards to expire before we are able to utilize them. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOL\ncarryforwards is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nOur estimate of the size of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate.\nData for retail sales of auto products is collected for most, but not all channels, and as a result, it is difficult to estimate the size of the\nmarket and predict the rate at which the market for our products will grow, if at all. While our market size estimate was made in good faith\nand is based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, this estimate may not be accurate. If our estimates of the size of our\naddressable market are not accurate, our potential for future growth may be less than we currently anticipate, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nPossible new tariffs that might be imposed by the United States government could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign governments’ trade policies have resulted in, and may continue to result in, tariffs on imports into and\nexports from the U.S., among other restrictions. Throughout 2018 and 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from several countries,\nincluding China. If further tariffs are imposed on imports of our products, or retaliatory trade measures are taken by China or other\ncountries in response to existing or future tariffs, we could be forced to raise prices on all of our imported products or make changes to our\noperations, any of which could materially harm our revenue or operating results. Any additional future tariffs or quotas imposed on our\nproducts or related materials may impact our sales, gross margin and profitability if we are unable to pass increased prices onto our\ncustomers.\nWe face exposure to product liability lawsuits.\nThe automotive industry in general has been subject to a large number of product liability claims due to the nature of personal injuries\nthat result from car accidents or malfunctions. As a distributor of auto parts, including parts obtained overseas, we could be held liable for\nthe injury or damage caused if the products we sell are defective or malfunction regardless of whether the product manufacturer is the party\nat fault. While we carry insurance against product liability claims, if the damages in any given action were high or we were subject to\nmultiple lawsuits, the damages and costs could exceed the limits of our insurance coverage or prevent us from obtaining coverage in the\nfuture. If we were required to pay substantial damages as a result of these lawsuits, it may seriously harm our business and financial\ncondition. Even defending against unsuccessful claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and result in a diversion of\nmanagement’s attention. In addition, even if the money damages themselves did not cause substantial harm to our business, the damage to\nour reputation and the brands offered on our websites could adversely affect our future reputation and our brand, and could result in a\ndecline in our net sales and profitability.\nFailure to comply with privacy laws and regulations and failure to adequately protect customer data could harm our business, damage\nour reputation and result in a loss of customers.\nFederal and state and regulations may govern the collection, use, sharing and security of data that we receive from our customers. In\naddition, we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the\n18\nTable of Contents\ncollection, use and disclosure of customer data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with\nany data-related consent orders, U.S. Federal Trade Commission requirements or other federal, state or international privacy-related laws\nand regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could potentially harm our\nbusiness. Further, failure or perceived failure to comply with our policies or applicable requirements related to the collection, use or\nsecurity of personal information or other privacy-related matters could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers.\nThe regulatory framework for data privacy is constantly evolving, and privacy concerns could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues is currently evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The\noccurrence of unanticipated events often rapidly drives the adoption of legislation or regulation affecting the use of data and the way we\nconduct our business; in fact, there are active discussions among U.S. legislators around adoption of a new U.S. federal privacy law.\nRestrictions could be placed upon the collection, management, aggregation and use of information, which could result in a material\nincrease in the cost of collecting and maintaining certain kinds of data. In June of 2018, California enacted the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information\ncollected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information\n(subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated\nagainst for exercising these rights. We are required to comply with the CCPA. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well\nas a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance\ncosts and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy\nlegislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nChallenges by OEMs to the validity of the aftermarket auto parts industry and claims of intellectual property infringement could\nadversely affect our business and the viability of the aftermarket auto parts industry.\nOEMs have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and distributors of aftermarket\nproducts to restrict or eliminate the sale of aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims. The OEMs have brought such claims in\nfederal court and with the United States International Trade Commission. We have received in the past, and we anticipate we may in the\nfuture receive, communications alleging that certain products we sell infringe the patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names or other\nintellectual property rights of OEMs or other third parties. For instance, after approximately three and a half years of litigation and related\ncosts and expenses, on April 16, 2009, we entered into a settlement agreement with Ford Motor Company and Ford Global Technologies,\nLLC that ended the two legal actions that were initiated by Ford against us related to claims of patent infringement.\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office records indicate that OEMs are seeking and obtaining more design patents and\ntrademarks than they have in the past. In some cases, we have entered into license agreements that allow us to sell aftermarket parts that\nreplicate OEM patented parts in exchange for a royalty. In the event that our license agreements, or other similar license arrangements are\nterminated or we are unable to agree upon renewal terms, we may be subject to restrictions on our ability to sell aftermarket parts that\nreplicate parts covered by design patents or trademarks, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn 2018, for example, the CBP alleged that certain repair grilles imported by the Company were counterfeit and infringed on\ntrademarks registered by OEMs. The Company subsequently settled with CBP, however, to the extent that the OEMs are successful in\nobtaining and enforcing other intellectual property rights, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling certain aftermarket products\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business. Infringement claims could also result in increased costs of doing business arising from\nnew importing requirements, increased port and carrier fees and legal expenses, adverse judgments or settlements or changes to our\nbusiness practices required to settle such claims or satisfy any judgments. Litigation or regulatory enforcement could also result in\ninterpretations of the law that require us to change our business practices or otherwise increase our costs and harm our business. We may\nnot maintain sufficient, or any, insurance coverage to cover the types of claims that could be asserted. If a successful claim were brought\nagainst us, it could expose us to significant liability.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our reputation and brand could be impaired and we could lose customers.\nWe regard our trademarks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property such as our proprietary back-end order processing and\nfulfillment code and process as important to our success. We rely on trademark and copyright law, and trade secret protection, and\nconfidentiality and/or license agreements with employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We cannot be\ncertain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our proprietary rights, especially in countries where the laws may not protect our rights\nas fully as in the United States. In addition, our proprietary rights may be infringed or misappropriated, and we could be required to incur\nsignificant expenses to preserve them. In the past we have filed litigation to protect our intellectual property rights. The outcome of such\nlitigation can be uncertain, and the cost of prosecuting such litigation may have an adverse impact on our earnings. We have common law\ntrademarks, as well as pending federal trademark registrations for several marks and several registered marks. However, any registrations\nmay not adequately cover our intellectual property or protect us against infringement by others. Effective trademark, service mark,\ncopyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services may be made\navailable online. We also currently own or control a number of Internet domain names, including www.carparts.com, www.jcwhitney.com,\nwww.autopartswarehouse.com and www.usautoparts.com, and have invested time and money in the purchase of domain names and other\nintellectual property, which may be impaired if we cannot protect such intellectual property. We may be unable to protect these domain\nnames or acquire or maintain relevant domain names in the United States and in other countries. If we are not able to protect our\ntrademarks, domain names or other intellectual property, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition\nand customer loyalty.\nBecause we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur\nsubstantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other costs as well as reputational harm.\nWe are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers, employees or other third parties for various reasons. The\ndamages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings could be substantial. Although we maintain liability insurance for some\nlitigation claims, if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover\na claim, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For more\ninformation on our ongoing litigation, see the information set forth under the caption “Legal Matters” in “Note 8 Commitments and\nContingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely\naffect our business operations and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be\ninterpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Act enacted\nmany significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to\nthe Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. In addition, it is uncertain\nif and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates,\nthe realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under\nthe Tax Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-\ntime charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nExisting or future government regulation could expose us to liabilities and costly changes in our business operations and could reduce\ncustomer demand for our products and services.\nWe are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-\npublic information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices, as well as laws and regulations governing businesses in\ngeneral and the Internet and eCommerce and certain environmental laws. Additional\n20\nTable of Contents\nlaws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet, the effect of which on eCommerce is uncertain. These laws may cover\nissues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and\npromotional practices, money transfers, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other\ncommunications, intellectual property rights, and information security. Furthermore, it is not clear how existing laws such as those\ngoverning issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, trespass, data mining and collection, and personal privacy apply to the\nInternet and eCommerce. To the extent we expand into international markets, we will be faced with complying with local laws and\nregulations, some of which may be materially different than U.S. laws and regulations. Any such foreign law or regulation, any new U.S.\nlaw or regulation, or the interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet or other online services or our business\nin general, may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations by, among other\nthings, impeding the growth of the Internet, subjecting us to fines, penalties, damages or other liabilities, requiring costly changes in our\nbusiness operations and practices, and reducing customer demand for our products and services. We may not maintain sufficient, or any,\ninsurance coverage to cover the types of claims or liabilities that could arise as a result of such regulation.\nWe may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change.\nThe growing political and scientific sentiment is that global weather patterns are being influenced by increased levels of greenhouse\ngases in the earth’s atmosphere. This growing sentiment and the concern over climate change have led to legislative and regulatory\ninitiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions which warm the earth’s atmosphere. These warmer weather conditions could result\nin a decrease in demand for auto parts in general. Moreover, proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas\nemissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the United States. Laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers\n(through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products) or our business (through an impact on our\ninventory availability, cost of sales, operations or demand for the products we sell) could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows. Significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of\ncarbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles, annual miles driven or\nthe products we sell or lead to changes in automotive technology. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or\nstricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers. Our inability to respond to such\nchanges could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased public attention related to ESG matters may expose us to negative public perception and could result in additional costs on\nour business.\nRecently, more attention is being directed towards publicly traded companies regarding ESG matters. A failure, or perceived failure, to\nrespond to investor or customer expectations related to ESG concerns could impact the value of our brand, the cost of our operations or\nrelationships with investors, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, new regulatory\ninitiatives related to ESG matters could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related To Our Use Of Technology\nWe depend on search engines and other online sources to attract visitors to our websites and marketplace channels, and if we are\nunable to attract these visitors and convert them into customers in a cost-effective manner, our business and results of operations will be\nharmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract customers in a cost-effective manner. Our investments in marketing may not effectively\nreach potential consumers or those consumers may not decide to buy from us or the volume of consumers that purchase from us may not\nyield the intended return on investment. With respect to our marketing channels, we rely on relationships with providers of online services,\nsearch engines, shopping comparison sites and eCommerce businesses to provide content, advertising banners and other links that direct\ncustomers to our websites. We rely on these relationships as significant sources of traffic to our websites. In particular, we rely on Google\nas an\n21\nTable of Contents\nimportant marketing channel, and if Google changes its algorithms or if competition increases for advertisements on Google or on our\nmarketplace channels, we may be unable to cost-effectively attract customers to our products.\nOur agreements with our marketing providers generally have terms of one year or less. If we are unable to develop or maintain these\nrelationships on acceptable terms, our ability to attract new customers would be harmed. In addition, many of the parties with whom we\nhave online-advertising arrangements could provide advertising services to other companies, including retailers with whom we compete. As\ncompetition for online advertising has increased, the cost for these services has also increased. A significant increase in the cost of the\nmarketing vehicles upon which we rely could adversely impact our ability to attract customers in a cost-effective manner and harm our\nbusiness and results of operations. Further, we use promotions as a way to drive sales, these promotional activities may not drive sales and\nmay adversely affect our gross margins.\nSimilarly, if any free search engine, shopping comparison site, or marketplace site on which we rely begins charging fees for listing or\nplacement, or if one or more of the search engines, shopping comparison sites, marketplace sites and other online sources on which we rely\nfor purchased listings, increases their fees, or modifies or terminates its relationship with us, our expenses could rise, we could lose\ncustomers and traffic to our websites could decrease.\nWe rely on bandwidth and data center providers and other third parties to provide products to our customers, and any failure or\ninterruption in the services provided by these third parties could disrupt our business and cause us to lose customers.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, including data center and bandwidth providers. Any disruption in the network access or co-location\nservices, which are the services that house and provide Internet access to our servers, provided by these third-party providers or any failure\nof these third-party providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other\ndifficulties our providers face may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which we cannot predict. We exercise\nlittle control over these third-party vendors, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We also license\ntechnology and related databases from third parties to facilitate elements of our eCommerce platform. We have experienced and expect to\ncontinue to experience interruptions and delays in service and availability for these elements. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays\nexperienced in connection with these third-party technologies could negatively impact our relationship with our customers and adversely\naffect our business. Our systems also heavily depend on the availability of electricity, which also comes from third-party providers. If we\nwere to experience a major power outage, we would have to rely on back-up generators. These back-up generators may not operate\nproperly through a major power outage, and their fuel supply could also be inadequate during a major power outage. Information systems\nsuch as ours may be disrupted by even brief power outages, or by the fluctuations in power resulting from switches to and from backup\ngenerators. This could disrupt our business and cause us to lose customers.\nSecurity threats, such as ransomware attacks, to our IT infrastructure could expose us to liability, and damage our reputation and\nbusiness.\nIt is essential to our business strategy that our technology and network infrastructure remain secure and is perceived by our customers\nto be secure. Despite security measures, however, any network infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Information security risks\nhave significantly increased in recent years in part due to the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and\nactivities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign private parties and state actors. As a leading\nonline source for automotive aftermarket parts, we have in the past experienced and we could continue to face cyber-attacks that attempt to\npenetrate our network security, including our data centers, to sabotage or otherwise disable our network of websites and online\nmarketplaces, misappropriate our or our customers’ proprietary information, which may include personally identifiable information, or\ncause interruptions of our internal systems and services. For example, in June 2020, we were the subject of a ransomware attack on our\nnetwork that briefly disrupted access to some of our systems. Although we did not pay the ransomware and did not incur any fines or\nsettlements, we did incur out of pocket expenses costs related to this incident of $100,000. If successful, any of these attacks could\nnegatively affect our reputation, damage our network infrastructure and our ability to sell our products, harm our relationship with\ncustomers that are affected and expose us to financial liability.\n22\nTable of Contents\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, our internal controls relating to cybersecurity may not prevent or\nidentify all such attacks in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and\noperations, and we cannot eliminate the risk of human error or employee or vendor malfeasance.\nIn addition, any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations could cause us to incur\nsignificant costs to protect any customers whose personal data was compromised and to restore customer confidence in us and to make\nchanges to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations. In addition, our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to\nstop shopping on our sites altogether. Such events could lead to lost sales and adversely affect our results of operations. We also could be\nexposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nMoreover, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\"), issued by the PCI Council. PCI DSS\ncontains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and\ntransmission of individual cardholder data. We cannot be certain that all of our information technology systems are able to prevent, contain\nor detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To\nthe extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected by\nclaims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations and others. In addition, the cost of\ncomplying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards could be significant to us. In January 2024, we were deemed to\nbe PCI compliant by PCI DSS 3.2.1, the new security standards as issued by the PCI Council. In the future, there could be additional new\nstandards and there is no guarantee that we will be able to conform to these new standards, and if we fail to meet these standards, we could\nbecome subject to fines and other penalties and experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. In addition, such failure\ncould damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business.\nOur eCommerce system is dependent on open-source software, which exposes us to uncertainty and potential liability.\nWe utilize open-source software such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Fedora and Perl throughout our web properties and supporting\ninfrastructure although we have created proprietary programs. Open-source software is maintained and upgraded by a general community\nof software developers under various open-source licenses, including the GNU General Public License (“GPL”). These developers are\nunder no obligation to maintain, enhance or provide any fixes or updates to this software in the future. Additionally, under the terms of the\nGPL and other open-source licenses, we may be forced to release to the public source-code internally developed by us pursuant to such\nlicenses. Furthermore, if any of these developers contribute any code of others to any of the software that we use, we may be exposed to\nclaims and liability for intellectual property infringement and may also be forced to implement changes to the code-base for this software\nor replace this software with internally developed or commercially licensed software.\nSystem failures, including failures due to natural disasters or other catastrophic events, could prevent access to our websites, which\ncould reduce our net sales and harm our reputation.\nOur sales would decline and we could lose existing or potential customers if they are not able to access our websites or if our websites,\ntransactions processing systems or network infrastructure do not perform to our customers’ satisfaction. Any Internet network interruptions\nor problems with our websites could:\n● prevent customers from accessing our websites;\n● reduce our ability to fulfill orders or bill customers;\n● reduce the number of products that we sell;\n● cause customer dissatisfaction; or\n23\nTable of Contents\n● damage our brand and reputation.\nWe have experienced brief computer system interruptions in the past, and we believe they may continue to occur from time to time in\nthe future. Our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of sources, including a natural disaster\nor other catastrophic event such as an earthquake, typhoon, volcanic eruption, fire, flood, terrorist attack, computer viruses, power loss,\ntelecommunications failure, physical and electronic break-ins and other similar events. For example, our headquarters and the majority of\nour infrastructure, including some of our servers, are located in Southern California, a seismically active region. We also maintain offshore\nand outsourced operations in the Philippines, an area that has been subjected to a typhoon and a volcanic eruption in the recent past. In\naddition, California has in the past experienced power outages as a result of limited electrical power supplies and due to recent fires in the\nsouthern part of the state. Such outages, natural disasters and similar events may recur in the future and could disrupt the operation of our\nbusiness. Our technology infrastructure is also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions.\nAlthough the critical portions of our systems are redundant and backup copies are maintained offsite, not all of our systems and data are\nfully redundant. We do not presently have a formal disaster recovery plan in effect and may not have sufficient insurance for losses that\nmay occur from natural disasters or catastrophic events. Any substantial disruption of our technology infrastructure could cause\ninterruptions or delays in our business and loss of data or render us unable to accept and fulfill customer orders or operate our websites in a\ntimely manner, or at all.\nWe recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning system in fiscal year 2022, and we may occasionally update or integrate\nother IT systems. Problems with the design, integration or implementation of these systems could interfere with our business and\noperations.\nWe recently completed a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (ERP) in fiscal year 2022.\nThe ERP is designed to accurately maintain the company's books and records and provide important information to the company's\nmanagement team for use in the operation of the business. The Company's ERP required the investment of significant human and financial\nresources. If the ERP system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to\nproduce financial reports and process transactions. Additionally, if we are unable to successfully implement any new IT system, remediate,\nupdate or integrate our existing systems at times when necessary, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be\nnegatively impacted.\nIf we do not respond to technological change, our websites could become obsolete and our financial results and conditions could be\nadversely affected.\nWe maintain a network of websites which requires substantial development and maintenance efforts, and entails significant technical\nand business risks. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our\nwebsites. The Internet and the eCommerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change, the emergence of new industry\nstandards and practices and changes in customer requirements and preferences. Therefore, we may be required to license emerging\ntechnologies, enhance our existing websites, develop new services and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied\nneeds of our current and prospective customers, and adapt to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and\npractices in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our ability to remain technologically competitive may require substantial expenditures and\nlead time and our failure to take necessary action in a timely manner to improve our websites and other technology applications may harm\nour business and results of operations.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nThe use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communication, which\nallow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, has become commonplace. Negative commentary\nregarding us or the brands that we sell may be posted on social media platforms or similar devices at any time and may harm our reputation\nor business. Consumers value readily available information concerning retailers and their goods and services and often act on such\ninformation without further\n24\nTable of Contents\ninvestigation and without regard to its accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nIn addition, social media platforms provide users with access to such a broad audience that collective action against our website and\nmarketplace stores, such as boycotts, can be more easily organized. If such actions were organized, we could suffer reputational damage as\nwell as physical damage to our stores and merchandise.\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools or as channels to disseminate information. For example, the Company and its\nexecutive officers maintain Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media accounts, where marketing and other\ninformation relevant to customers and investors is disseminated. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these\nplatforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in\nthe use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or subject us to\nfines or other penalties.\nRisks Related To Our Capital Stock\nOur common stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, which may result in losses to our stockholders.\nThe market prices of technology and eCommerce companies generally have been extremely volatile and have recently experienced\nsharp share price and trading volume changes. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in\nresponse to, among other things, the risk factors described in this report and other factors beyond our control such as fluctuations in the\noperations or valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us, our ability to meet analysts’ expectations, our trading\nvolume, activities of activist investors, the impact of any stock repurchase program or conditions or trends in the Internet or auto parts\nindustries.\nSince the completion of our initial public offering in February 2007 through December 30, 2023, the trading price of our common\nstock has been volatile. We have also experienced significant fluctuations in the trading volume of our common stock. General economic\nand political conditions unrelated to our performance may also adversely affect the price of our common stock. In the past, following\nperiods of volatility in the market price of a public company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated. Due to\nthe inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation if it were initiated. The initiation of\nany such litigation or an unfavorable result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate and may fail to meet market expectations.\nWe expect that our revenue and operating results will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to various factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. The factors that could cause our operating results to continue to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n● fluctuations in the demand for aftermarket auto parts;\n● fluctuations in the availability of products for resale;\n● price competition on the Internet or among offline retailers for auto parts;\n● our ability to attract visitors to our websites and convert those visitors into customers, including to the extent based on our\nability to successfully work with different search engines to drive visitors to our websites;\n● our ability to successfully sell our products through third-party online marketplaces or the effects of any price increases in\nthose marketplaces;\n● competition from companies that have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, access to\nmerchandise at lower costs and significantly greater resources than we do, like third-party online market places and our\nsuppliers;\n25\nTable of Contents\n● our ability to maintain and expand our supplier and distribution relationships without significant price increases or reduced\nservice levels;\n● our ability to borrow funds under our Credit Facility;\n● the effects of seasonality on the demand for our products;\n● our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products, price our products at market rates and maintain appropriate\ninventory levels;\n● our ability to build and maintain customer loyalty;\n● our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;\n● infringement actions that could impact the viability of the auto parts aftermarket or portions thereof;\n● the success of our brand-building and marketing campaigns;\n● our ability to accurately project our future revenues, earnings, and results of operations;\n● government regulations related to use of the Internet for commerce, including the application of existing tax regulations to\nInternet commerce and changes in tax regulations;\n● technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet brownouts;\n● the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and\ninfrastructure; and\n● macroeconomic conditions that adversely impact the general and automotive retail sales environment.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting or comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and our stock price could decline.\nWhile management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 30, 2023, we\nhave in the past identified, and could in the future identify, a significant deficiency or material weakness in internal control over financial\nreporting or fail to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to properly maintain an effective system of\ninternal control over financial reporting, it could impact our ability to prevent fraud or to issue our financial statements in a timely manner\nthat presents fairly our financial condition and results of operations. The existence of any such deficiencies or weaknesses, even if\nremediated, may also lead to the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, could harm our business and\nnegatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Such deficiencies or material weaknesses may also subject us to lawsuits,\nregulatory investigations and other penalties.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur charter documents could deter a takeover effort, which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so\nwould be beneficial to our stockholders. Such provisions include the following:\n● our Board of Directors are authorized, without prior stockholder approval, to create and issue preferred stock which could be\nused to implement anti-takeover devices;\n● advance notice is required for director nominations or for proposals that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n● stockholder and stockholder nominees for director are required to provide detailed information, regarding both the relevant\nstockholder and nominee, in connection with stockholder nominations for director;\n● our Board of Directors is classified such that not all members of our board are elected at one time, which may make it more\ndifficult for a person who acquires control of a majority of our outstanding voting stock to replace all or a majority of our\ndirectors;\n● stockholder action by written consent is prohibited except with regards to an action that has been approved by the Board of\nDirectors;\n● special meetings of the stockholders are permitted to be called only by the chairman of our Board of Directors or by a\nmajority of our Board of Directors;\n● stockholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors; and\n● stockholders are permitted to amend certain provisions of our bylaws only upon receiving at least 66 2/3% of the votes\nentitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting\ntogether as a single class.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will enhance shareholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price\nof our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors has periodically authorized share repurchases, funded from available working capital, including up to $30\nmillion authorized in July 2021. The share repurchase program has an expiration date of July 26, 2026. Although our Board of Directors\nhas authorized our share repurchase program, this program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any\nspecific number of shares. The share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock, increase volatility and diminish our\ncash reserves. In addition, there can be no guarantee that repurchases made under our share repurchase program, if any, will enhance\nshareholder value.\nFuture capital raises may dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders’ percentage ownership may decrease, and these\nstockholders may experience substantial dilution.\nITEM 1B.

CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nBecause it is essential to our operations and business strategy that our website, app, technology and network infrastructure remain\nsecure, we have processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. We have integrated\nthese processes into our cybersecurity risk management program.\nThe key processes, or components, of our cybersecurity risk management include:\n● conducting periodic risk assessments to assist in identifying cybersecurity threats or risks;\n● cybersecurity strategic roadmap;\n● security and IT infrastructure management team, responsible for managing our cybersecurity processes, implementing\nsecurity applications and protocols, monitoring and executing security or network controls, and responding to incidents or\nthreats;\n● cybersecurity training programs and cybersecurity awareness event for employees;\n● incident response plan, including assessing and monitoring potential cyber threats;\n● similar processes or applications to mitigate or manage cybersecurity risk from third-party service providers;\nWe sometimes engage external cybersecurity experts, or applications, to enhance our cybersecurity program. These serve to assist our\ninternal cybersecurity team in mitigating cyber threats, in addition to monitoring and responding to potential cyber incidents.\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2020, we were the subject of a ransomware attack on our network that briefly disrupted access to\nsome of our systems. Although we did not pay the ransomware and did not incur any fines or settlements, we did incur out of pocket\nexpenses costs related to this incident of $100,000. We have not encountered any other cybersecurity challenges that have materially\nimpaired our operations or business.\nAdditional information regarding risks from cybersecurity threats is discussed in Part I, Item IA, “Risk Factors,” under the heading\n“Security threats, such as ransomware attacks, to our IT infrastructure could expose us to liability, and damage our reputation and\nbusiness,” which should be read in conjunction with the information herein.\nGovernance\nCybersecurity risk management is an important priority integrated into our overall governance structure. Our Board of Directors\noversees risks from cybersecurity threats and includes the involvement of the Audit Committee in the governance strategy.\nOur IT security management team, led by our Chief Technology Officer, reports quarterly in meetings to our Audit Committee and\nperiodically to our Board of Directors regarding updates to our cybersecurity program and related risks. We have a cybersecurity expert on\nthe Board of Directors and its Audit Committee to provide expanded expertise and oversight on our cybersecurity processes and systems.\nTopics in the meetings include discussion of the company-wide cybersecurity strategic roadmap and risks, protocols to mitigate such rusks,\nand the progress of initiatives in the cybersecurity program. Specific cybersecurity briefing areas may include topics such as security,\ninfrastructure,\n28\nTable of Contents\ncybersecurity tooling/applications, and compliance.\nITEM 2.

Certain statements in this report, including statements regarding our business\nstrategies, operations, financial condition, and prospects are forward-looking statements. Use of the words “anticipates,” “believes,”\n“could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will likely\ncontinue,” “will likely result” and similar expressions that contemplate future events may identify forward-looking statements.\nThe information contained in this section is not a complete description of our business or the risks associated with an investment in\nour common stock. We urge you to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports\nfiled with the SEC, which are available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. The section entitled “Risk Factors” set forth in Part I,\nItem 1A of this report, and similar discussions in our other SEC filings, describe some of the important factors, risks and uncertainties that\nmay affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nexpressed or implied by these or any other forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. You are cautioned not to place undue\nreliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations and reflect management’s opinions only as of the\ndate thereof. We do not assume any obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements. Finally, our historic results should not be\nviewed as indicative of future performance.\n31\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nWe are a leading online provider of aftermarket auto parts, including replacement parts, hard parts, and performance parts and\naccessories. Our proprietary product database maps our SKUs to product applications based on vehicle makes, models and years. We\nprincipally sell our products to individual consumers through our flagship website at www.carparts.com, our app, and online marketplaces.\nOur corporate website is located at www.carparts.com/investor. The inclusion of our website addresses in this report does not include or\nincorporate by reference into this report any information on our websites.\nWe believe disintermediating the traditional auto parts supply chain and selling products directly to customers online allows us to\nefficiently deliver products to our customers. Industry-wide trends that support our strategy and future growth include:\n1. Number of SKUs required to serve the market. The number of automotive SKUs has grown dramatically over the last\nseveral years. In today’s market, unless the consumer is driving a high volume produced vehicle and needs a simple maintenance\nitem, the part they need is not typically on the shelf at a brick-and-mortar store. We believe our user-friendly flagship website, and\napp, provides customers with a favorable alternative to the brick-and-mortar shopping experience by offering a comprehensive\nselection of approximately 1,047,000 SKUs with detailed product descriptions, attributes and photographs combined with the\nflexibility of fulfilling orders using both drop-ship and stock-and-ship methods.\n2. U.S. vehicle fleet expanding and aging. The average age of U.S. light vehicles, an indicator of auto parts demand,\nreached a new record-high of 12.5 years in 2023, according to the U.S. Auto Care Association. We believe an increasing vehicle\nbase and rising average age of vehicles will have a positive impact on overall aftermarket parts demand because older vehicles\ngenerally require more repairs. In many cases we believe these older vehicles are driven by DIY car owners who are more likely to\nhandle any necessary repairs themselves rather than taking their car to the professional repair shop.\n3. Growth of online sales. The U.S. Auto Care Association estimated that overall revenue from online sales of auto parts and\naccessories would reach approximately $21 billion by 2025. Improved product availability, lower prices and consumers’ growing\ncomfort with digital platforms are driving the shift to online sales. We believe that we are well positioned for the shift to online\nsales due to being a leading source for aftermarket automotive parts through our flagship website, app, and online marketplaces.\nExecutive Summary\nFor fiscal year 2023, the Company’s operations generated net sales of $675,729, compared to $661,604 for fiscal year 2022,\nrepresenting an increase of 2.1%. The Company incurred a net loss of $8,223 for fiscal year 2023 compared to a net loss of $951 for fiscal\nyear 2022. The Company’s net loss before interest (income) expense, net, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization expense,\namortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expense (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), was $19,687 in fiscal year 2023 compared to\n$26,113 in fiscal year 2022. Refer to the section below titled “Non-GAAP measures” for information regarding our use of Adjusted\nEBITDA and a reconciliation from net loss.\nNet sales increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 primarily driven by continued demand. Gross profit decreased by\n0.6% to $229,406. Gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 33.9% in fiscal year 2023 compared to 34.9% in fiscal year 2022. The\ndecrease in gross margin was primarily driven by unfavorable freight costs and a shift in product mix.\nTotal expenses, which primarily consisted of cost of sales and operating expense, increased in fiscal year 2023 compared to the same\nperiod in 2022. The components of cost of sales and operating costs are described in further detail under “Components of Results of\nOperations” below.\n32\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP measures\nRegulation G, “Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” and other provisions of the Exchange Act, as amended,\ndefine and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. We provide EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which\nare non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA consists of net loss before (a) interest (income) expense, net; (b) income tax provision;\n(c) depreciation and amortization expense; and (d) amortization of intangible assets; while Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA before\nshare-based compensation expense.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to management and\ninvestors. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company’s operations that, when\nviewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete\nunderstanding of factors and trends affecting the Company’s business and results of operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as one measure of the Company’s operating performance because it assists in comparing the\nCompany’s operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of stock compensation expense, as well as other items that\nwe do not believe are representative of our ongoing operating performance. Internally, this non-GAAP measure is also used by\nmanagement for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial\nperformance; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use\nAdjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate the ongoing operations of companies in our industry.\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and\nshould not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial\nmeasures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP\nadjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company’s non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an\ninference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\nThe table below reconciles net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022\nNet loss $ (8,223) $ (951) $ (10,339)\nDepreciation & amortization 16,690 13,607 9,895\nAmortization of intangible assets 36 108 110\nInterest (income) expense, net (636) 1,421 1,089\nIncome tax provision 145 632 351\nEBITDA $ 8,012 $ 14,817 $ 1,106\nStock compensation expense $ 11,675 $ 11,296 $ 15,685\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 19,687 $ 26,113 $ 16,791\nComponents of Results of Operations\nNet Sales. Online and offline sales represent two different sales channels for our products. Online is our primary sales channel as we\ngenerate net sales primarily from eCommerce sales of auto parts to individual consumers through our mobile-friendly website at\nwww.carparts.com, our app, and online marketplaces. Online marketplaces consist primarily of sales of our products on online marketplace\nwebsites, where we sell through online storefronts that we maintain on third-party owned websites such as eBay and Amazon. Our offline\nsales channel represents our distribution of products directly to commercial customers by selling auto parts to collision repair shops. Our\noffline sales channel\n33\nTable of Contents\nalso includes both stock ship distribution as well as drop ship programs for automotive warehouse distributors and other online resellers.\nThe product mix includes the majority of our house brands stock ship parts, which include the replacement collision parts and our Kool-\nVue® mirror line.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales consists of the direct costs associated with procuring parts from suppliers and delivering products to\ncustomers. These costs include direct product costs, outbound freight and shipping costs, warehouse supplies and warranty costs, partially\noffset by purchase discounts. Depreciation and amortization expenses are excluded from cost of sales and included in operating expense.\nOperating Expense. Operating expense consists of marketing, general and administrative, fulfillment, and technology expense. We also\ninclude share-based compensation expense in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient’s\nfunction. Marketing expense consists of online advertising spend, television advertising, internet commerce facilitator fees and other\nadvertising costs, as well as payroll and related expenses associated with our customer service and marketing personnel. General and\nadministrative expense consists primarily of administrative payroll and related expenses, merchant processing fees, legal and professional\nfees and other administrative costs. Fulfillment expense consists primarily of payroll and related costs associated with our warehouse\nemployees and our purchasing group, facilities rent, building maintenance, depreciation and other costs associated with inventory\nmanagement and our wholesale operations. Technology expense consists primarily of payroll and related expenses of our information\ntechnology personnel, the cost of hosting our servers, communications expenses and internet connectivity costs, computer support and\nsoftware development amortization expense. Marketing expense, general and administrative expense, and fulfillment expense also includes\ndepreciation and amortization expense.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net primarily consists of miscellaneous income or expense and interest income comprised primarily\nof interest income on investments.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense on our outstanding revolving loan and letters of credit\nbalances, deferred financing cost amortization and finance lease interest.\nPresentation of Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources includes a comparison of\nfiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2022.

Under the provisions of ASC 740,\nmanagement is required to evaluate whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred tax assets based on the\nconsideration of all available evidence using a “more likely than not” standard. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon taxable\nincome in prior carryback years, estimates of future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and reversal of existing taxable temporary\ndifferences. ASC 740 provides that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative\nevidence such as cumulative losses in recent years or losses expected in early future years. As of December 30, 2023, due to cumulative\nlosses in recent years, the Company maintained a valuation allowance in the amount of $38,458 against deferred tax assets that were not\nmore likely than not to be realized.\nAs of December 30, 2023, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits, interest or penalties related to federal and state\nincome tax matters. As of December 30, 2023, the Company’s federal and state NOL carryforwards were $105,224 and $84,780,\nrespectively. Federal NOL carryforwards of $891 were acquired in the acquisition of WAG which are subject to Section 382 of the Code\nand limited to an annual usage limitation of $135. The Company’s federal NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2029, while state NOL\ncarryforwards also begin to expire in 2029.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nDuring the fifty-two weeks ended December 30, 2023, we primarily funded our operations with cash and cash equivalents generated\nfrom operations. We had cash and cash equivalents of $50,951 as of December 30, 2023, representing a $32,184 increase from $18,767 of\ncash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash\nequivalents, investments, cash flows from operations and available funds under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to finance our\noperations through at least the next twelve months (see “Debt and Available Borrowing Resources” and “Funding Requirements” below).\nAs of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our working capital was $80,352 and $79,843, respectively.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 January 1, 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 50,001 $ 15,368 $ (6,988)\nNet cash used in investing activities (11,901) (12,517) (11,551)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (5,916) (2,153) 902\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash — (75) (21)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ 32,184 $ 623 $ (17,658)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $50,001 and\n$15,368, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by a higher net cash inflow from the\nchange in working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of\nadditions to property and equipment ($11,879 and $12,585, respectively), which are mainly related to capitalized website and software\ndevelopment costs.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $5,916 and $2,153 for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. The increase was primarily attributable to the repurchase of treasury stock in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\nDebt and Available Borrowing Resources\nTotal debt was $16,635 as of December 30, 2023 compared to $20,669 as of December 31, 2022 and primarily consists of right-of-use\nobligations-finance.\nThe Company maintains an asset-based revolving Credit Facility that provides for, among other things, a revolving commitment,\nwhich is subject to a borrowing base derived from certain receivables, inventory and property and equipment. On June 17, 2022, the\nCompany and JPMorgan entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) amending and\nrestating in its entirety the original Credit Agreement dated April 26, 2012. As amended, the Credit Agreement provides for the revolving\ncommitment in an aggregate principal amount of up to $75,000 (formerly $30,000) and allows for an uncommitted ability to increase the\naggregate principal amount by an additional $75,000 to $150,000 (formerly $40,000 maximum), subject to certain terms and conditions.\nThe Credit Facility matures on June 17, 2027.\nAs of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our outstanding revolving loan balance was $0, respectively. The outstanding\nstandby letters of credit balance as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $680 and $620, respectively, and we had $0 of our\ntrade letters of credit outstanding in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets. We use the trade letters of credit in the ordinary\ncourse of business to satisfy certain vendor obligations.\nLoans drawn under the Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to either (a) SOFR plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to\n2.00% per annum based on the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio, or (b) an “alternate prime base rate” subject to an increase from\n0.00% to 0.50% per annum based on the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 30, 2023, the Company’s SOFR based\ninterest rate was 7.45% and the Company’s prime based rate was 9.00%. A commitment fee, based upon undrawn availability under the\nCredit Facility bearing interest at a rate of either 0.20% or 0.25% per annum based on the amount of undrawn availability, is\npayable monthly. Under the terms of the\n37\nTable of Contents\nCredit Agreement, cash receipts are deposited into a lock-box, which are at the Company’s discretion unless the “cash dominion period” is\nin effect, during which cash receipts will be used to reduce amounts owing under the Credit Agreement. The cash dominion period is\ntriggered in an event of default or if “excess availability,” as defined under the Credit Agreement, is less than the $9,000 (12% of the\naggregate revolving commitment) for three consecutive business days, and will continue until, during the preceding 45 consecutive days,\nno event of default existed and excess availability has been greater than $9,000 at all times (with the trigger subject to adjustment based on\nthe Company’s revolving commitment). The Company’s required excess availability related to the “Covenant Testing Trigger Period” (as\ndefined under the Credit Agreement) is less than $7,500 (10% of the aggregate revolving commitment) for three consecutive business days,\nthe Company shall be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, and continuing until excess availability has\nbeen greater than or equal to $7,500 at all times for 45 consecutive days (with the trigger subject to adjustment based on the Company’s\nrevolving commitment).\nCertain of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries are co-borrowers (together with the Company, the “Borrowers”) under the Credit\nAgreement, and certain other domestic subsidiaries are guarantors (the “Guarantors” and, together with the Borrowers, the “Loan Parties”)\nunder the Credit Agreement. The Borrowers and the Guarantors are jointly and severally liable for the Borrowers’ obligations under the\nCredit Agreement. The Loan Parties’ obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and certain\nexclusions, by a perfected security interest in (a) all tangible and intangible assets and (b) all of the capital stock owned by the Loan Parties\n(limited, in the case of foreign subsidiaries, to 65% of the capital stock of such foreign subsidiaries). The Borrowers may voluntarily prepay\nthe loans at any time. The Borrowers are required to make mandatory prepayments of the loans (without payment of a premium) with net\ncash proceeds received upon the occurrence of certain “prepayment events,” which include certain sales or other dispositions of collateral,\ncertain casualty or condemnation events, certain equity issuances or capital contributions, and the incurrence of certain debt.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable\nto the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, investments,\ndispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, mergers, and dividends and other distributions.\nEvents of default under the Credit Agreement include: failure to timely make payments due under the Credit Agreement; material\nmisrepresentations or misstatements under the Credit Agreement and other related agreements; failure to comply with covenants under the\nCredit Agreement and other related agreements; certain defaults in respect of other material indebtedness; insolvency or other related\nevents; certain defaulted judgments; certain ERISA-related events; certain security interests or liens under the loan documents cease to be,\nor are challenged by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as not being, in full force and effect; any loan document or any material\nprovision of the same ceases to be in full force and effect; and certain criminal indictments or convictions of any Loan Party. As of\nDecember 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nSee additional information in “Note 4 – Borrowings” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8,\nof this report.\nFunding Requirements\nBased on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments, cash flows from operations and\navailable debt or equity financing will be sufficient to finance our operational cash needs through at least the next twelve months. Our\nfuture capital requirements may, however, vary materially from those now planned or anticipated. Changes in our operating plans, lower\nthan anticipated net sales or gross margin, increased expenses, continued or worsened economic conditions, worsening operating\nperformance by us, or other events, including those described in “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A may force us to sell assets or\nseek additional debt or equity financings in the future, including the issuance of additional common stock under a registration statement.\nThere can be no assurance that we would be able to raise such additional financing or engage in asset sales on acceptable terms, or at all. If\nwe are not able to raise adequate additional financing or proceeds from asset sales, we will need to defer, reduce or eliminate significant\nplanned expenditures, restructure or significantly curtail our operations.\n38\nTable of Contents\nSeasonality\nWe believe our business is somewhat seasonal in nature. It includes many categories, geographies, and channels which may\nexperience seasonality from time to time based on various external factors. Additionally, seasonality may affect our product mix. These\nhistorical seasonality trends could continue, and such trends may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations\nin subsequent periods.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates (“GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on\nan ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that of our\nsignificant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations” of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following accounting policies and estimates set forth below involve a greater degree of\njudgment or complexity.\nValuation of Inventory – Inventory Reserve. Inventory primarily consists of finished goods. We purchase inventory from suppliers both\ndomestically and internationally, primarily in Taiwan and China. Inventory is accounted for using the first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method and\nvalued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We recognize provisions for obsolete and slow-moving inventory primarily based on\njudgments about expected disposition of inventory, generally, through sales, or liquidations of obsolete inventory, and expected recoverable\nvalues based on currently-available or historical information. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by\nmanagement, additional write-offs to reduce the value of our inventory may be required.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign\ncurrency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is set forth below.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our revolving loan under our Credit Facility, which bears an interest rate based\non a SOFR, plus an applicable margin, and a prime based rate. As of December 30, 2023, we had a balance of $0 outstanding under our\nrevolving loan. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not materially affect our interest expense and cash flows.\nForeign Currency Risk\nOur purchases of auto parts from our Asian suppliers are denominated in U.S. dollars; however, a change in the foreign currency\nexchange rates could impact our product costs over time. Our operating expenses from our Philippines subsidiary are generally paid in\nPhilippine Pesos, and as the exchange rate fluctuates, it could adversely or favorably impact our operating results. The effect of a\nhypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk but could choose to do so\nin the future.\n39\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements required by this Item 8 are set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and are hereby incorporated into this\nItem 8 by reference.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in\nreports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods, and\nthat such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 30,\n2023 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to meet the objectives for which they\nwere designed and operated at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in\nRule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30,\n2023, based on the “Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission. This assessment was conducted utilizing our documentation of policies and procedures, risk control matrices, gap\nanalysis, key process walk-throughs and management’s knowledge of and interaction with its controls and testing of our key controls.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. Based on such assessment and criteria, management has concluded that the internal controls over financial reporting were\neffective as of December 30, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023 has been\naudited by RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included immediately following\nItem 15. Exhibit and Financial Statement Schedules, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company monitors and evaluates on an ongoing basis its internal control over financial reporting in order to improve its overall\neffectiveness. In the course of these evaluations, the Company modifies and refines its internal processes as conditions warrant. As required\nby Rule 13a-15(d), the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an\nevaluation of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter ended\nDecember 30, 2023 that have\n40\nTable of Contents\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Based on that\nevaluation, there has been no such change during the period covered by this report.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the thirteen weeks ended December 30, 2023, none of our directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any “Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.)\nITEM 9C.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 7, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any\nway our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInventory Reserves\nAs disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements, inventory is reported net of a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving products. The process of\ndetermining the inventory reserve requires management to evaluate and make judgments about expected disposition of inventory, generally,\nthrough sales, or liquidations of obsolete products, and expected recoverable values based on currently available or historical information.\nWe identified the inventory reserve as a critical audit matter as there was a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and increased audit effort\nwhen performing audit procedures to evaluate management’s significant assumptions, including the assumption that the historical inventory\nmovements are indicative of future sales.\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s estimation of inventory reserves included the following, among others:\nF-1\nTable of Contents\n● We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls over the Company’s inventory reserve process, including those over the validity and\nreasonableness of the data and assumptions used in estimating the inventory reserve and tested such controls for design and operating\neffectiveness.\n● Tested management’s process for determining the inventory reserve.\n● Developed an independent expectation of slow moving and obsolete inventory at year-end based on historical trends and other sources of\nindependently obtained industry data and compared it to management's estimate.\n● Evaluated subsequent events or transactions occurring prior to the date of the auditor's report.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015.\nIrvine, California\nMarch 7, 2024\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of CarParts.com, Inc.\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited CarParts.com, Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\n2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2023, and the\nrelated notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements) of the Company and our report dated March 7, 2024,\nexpressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A\ncompany's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the\ncompany's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that\nthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nIrvine, California\nMarch 7, 2024\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nCARPARTS.COM, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations\nCarParts.com, Inc. (including its subsidiaries) is a leading online retailer of aftermarket auto parts and accessories. The Company\nprimarily sells its products to individual consumers through its flagship website located at www.carparts.com, our app, online marketplaces,\nand offline to wholesale distributors. Our corporate website is located at www.carparts.com/investor. References to the “Company,” “we,”\n“us,” or “our” refer to CarParts.com, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe Company’s products consist of replacement parts serving the wear and tear and body repair market, hard parts to serve the\nmaintenance and repair market, and performance parts and accessories. The replacement parts category is primarily comprised of body\nparts for the exterior of an automobile as well as certain other mechanical or electrical parts that are not related to the functioning of the\nengine or drivetrain. Our parts in this category typically replace original body parts that have been damaged as a result of general wear and\ntear or a collision. In addition, we sell an extensive line of mirror products, including one of our own house brands called Kool-Vue®,\nwhich are marketed and sold as aftermarket replacement parts and as upgrades to existing parts. The hard parts category is primarily\ncomprised of engine components and other mechanical and electrical parts including one of our house brands of catalytic converters called\nEvan Fischer®. These hard parts serve as replacement parts that are generally used by professionals and do-it-yourselfers for engine and\nmechanical maintenance and repair. We also offer performance versions of many parts sold in each of the above categories. Performance\nparts and accessories generally consist of parts that enhance the performance of the automobile, upgrade existing functionality of a specific\npart or improve the physical appearance or comfort of the automobile.\nThe Company is a Delaware C corporation and is headquartered in Torrance, California. The Company has employees located in both\nthe United States and the Philippines.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year is based on a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The fiscal year ended\nDecember 30, 2023 (fiscal year 2023) is a 52 week period and December 31, 2022 (fiscal year 2022) is a 52 week period.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nBased on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments, cash flows from operations and\navailable debt or equity financing will be sufficient to finance our operational cash needs through at least the next twelve months.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. A key estimate made by management relates primarily to determining the net realizable\nvalue of inventory. Actual results could differ from this estimate.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all money market funds and short-term investments purchased with original maturities of ninety days or less\nto be cash equivalents.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFinancial instruments that are not measured at fair value include accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt. Refer to “Note 2 –\nFair Value Measurements” for additional fair value information. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and\naccounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nAccounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk\nAccounts receivable are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined primarily on\nthe basis of past collection experience and general economic conditions. The Company determines terms and conditions for its customers\nprimarily based on the volume purchased by the customer, customer creditworthiness and past transaction history.\nConcentrations of credit risk are primarily limited to the offline sales customer base to which the Company’s products are sold, which\nis related to trade receivables that are approximately 20% and 20% of total accounts receivable, net, balance as of the year ended December\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company does not believe significant concentrations of credit risk exist as a significant\nportion of the outstanding trade receivables balance is insured by a third-party credit insurance company.\nInventory\nInventories consist of finished goods available-for-sale and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, determined using the\nfirst-in first-out (“FIFO”) method. The Company purchases inventory from suppliers both domestically and internationally, and routinely\nenters into supply agreements with Asia-Pacific based suppliers in China and Taiwan and also U.S. based suppliers who are primarily drop-\nship vendors. The Company believes that its products are generally available from more than one supplier and seeks to maintain multiple\nsources for its products, both internationally and domestically. The Company primarily purchases products in bulk quantities to take\nadvantage of quantity discounts and to ensure inventory availability. Inventory is reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We\nrecognize provisions for obsolete and slow-moving inventory primarily based on judgments about expected disposition of inventory,\ngenerally, through sales, or liquidations of obsolete inventory, and expected recoverable values per SKU based on currently available or\nhistorical information.\nInventory as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 included items in-transit to our distribution centers, in the amounts of\n$26,801 and $17,444, respectively.\nWebsite and Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs associated with website and software developed for internal use according to ASC 350-50 -\nIntangibles – Goodwill and Other – Website Development Costs and ASC 350-40 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use\nSoftware, when both the preliminary project design and testing stage are completed and management has authorized further funding for the\nproject, which it deems probable of completion and to be used for the function intended. Capitalized costs include amounts directly related\nto website and software development such as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who\ndevote time to, the internal-use software project and website. Capitalization of such costs ceases when the project is substantially complete\nand ready for its intended use. These amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over two to five years once the software and/or website\nenhancement is placed into service. The Company capitalized website and software development costs of $9,951, $11,067 and $6,334\nduring fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our internally developed website\nand software costs amounted to $24,215 and $23,761, respectively, and the related accumulated amortization amounted to $13,608 and\n$13,898, respectively.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nLong-Lived Assets and Intangibles Subject to Amortization\nThe Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets, including intangibles subject to amortization, in\naccordance with ASC - 360 Property, Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). Management assesses potential impairments whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss will result\nwhen the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset\ngroup. Impairment losses will be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash\nflows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. As of December 30, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the Company’s long-lived assets did not indicate a potential impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, therefore no impairment\ncharges were recorded for fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDeferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the revolving loan using the straight-line method,\nwhich approximates amortization the effective interest method.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, when\nthe following revenue recognition criteria are met: a contract has been identified, separate performance obligations are identified, the\ntransaction price is determined, the transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations and revenue is recognized upon\nsatisfying each performance obligation. The Company transfers the risk of loss or damage upon shipment, therefore, revenue from product\nsales is recognized when it is shipped to the customer. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue by the Company’s best estimate of\nexpected product returns, are estimated using historical experience.\nThe Company evaluates the criteria of ASC 606 - Revenue Recognition Principal Agent Considerations in determining whether it is\nappropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when the\nCompany is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide a specified good or service, the Company is subject to inventory risk\nbefore the good or service has been transferred to a customer and the Company has discretion in establishing the price, revenue is recorded\nat gross.\nPayments received prior to the delivery of goods to customers are recorded as deferred revenue in other current liabilities in the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company periodically provides incentive offers to its customers to encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount\noffers, such as percentage discounts off current purchases and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted by the\nCompany’s customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction.\nSales discounts are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized. Sales return allowances are estimated based on\nhistorical amounts and are recorded upon recognizing the related sales. Credits are issued to customers for returned products.\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides an analysis of the allowance for sales returns and the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):\nCharged to\nBalance at Revenue, Balance at\nBeginning Cost or (Deductions) or End of\nof Period Expenses Recoveries Period\nFifty-Two Weeks Ended December 30, 2023\nAllowance for sales returns $ 3,073 $ 45,526 $ (45,408) $ 3,191\nAllowance for doubtful accounts 35 (6) (28) 1\nFifty-Two Weeks Ended December 31, 2022\nAllowance for sales returns $ 2,936 $ 44,950 $ (44,813) $ 3,073\nAllowance for doubtful accounts 9 22 4 35\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists of the direct costs associated with procuring parts from suppliers and delivering products to customers. These\ncosts include direct product costs, outbound freight and shipping costs, warehouse supplies and warranty costs, partially offset by purchase\ndiscounts. Total freight and shipping expense, excluding surcharges, included in cost of sales for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was\n$105,830, $93,593 and $89,785, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expenses are excluded from cost of sales and included in\noperating expense.\nWarranty Costs\nThe Company or the vendors supplying its products provide the Company’s customers limited warranties on certain products that\nrange from 30 days to lifetime. Historically, the Company’s vendors have been the party primarily responsible for warranty claims.\nStandard product warranties sold separately by the Company are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the life of the\nwarranty, ranging from one to five years. The Company also offers extended warranties that are imbedded in the price of selected private\nlabel products sold. The product brands that include the extended warranty coverage are offered at three different service levels: (a) a five\nyear unlimited product replacement, (b) a five year one-time product replacement, and (c) a three year one-time product replacement.\nWarranty costs relating to merchandise sold under warranty not covered by vendors are estimated and recorded as warranty obligations at\nthe time of sale based on each product’s historical return rate and historical warranty cost. The standard and extended warranty obligations\nare recorded as warranty liabilities and included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating Expense\nOperating expense consists of marketing, general and administrative, fulfillment, and technology expense. The Company also includes\nshare-based compensation expense in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient’s function.\nMarketing costs, including advertising, are expensed as incurred. The majority of advertising expense is paid to internet search engine\nservice providers, television advertising, and internet commerce facilitators. For fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized\nadvertising costs of $83,146, $79,854 and $69,102, respectively. Marketing expense also includes payroll and related expenses associated\nwith our customer service and marketing personnel. General and administrative expense consists primarily of administrative payroll and\nrelated expenses, merchant processing fees, legal and professional fees and other administrative costs. Fulfillment expense consists\nprimarily of payroll and related costs associated with warehouse employees and the Company’s purchasing group, facilities rent, building\nmaintenance, depreciation and other costs associated with inventory management and wholesale operations. Technology expense consists\nprimarily of payroll and related expenses of the Company’s information technology personnel, the cost of hosting the Company’s servers,\ncommunications expenses and internet connectivity costs, computer support and website and software development amortization expense.\nMarketing expense, general and administrative expense, and fulfillment expense also includes depreciation and amortization expense.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 - Compensation – Stock Compensation\n(“ASC 718”). All share-based payment awards issued to employees are recognized as share-based compensation expense in the statements\nof operations and comprehensive operations based on their respective grant date fair values. Compensation expense for service-based\nrestricted stock units is based on the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant, and is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period. Compensation expense for performance-based awards is measured based on the amount of shares\nultimately expected to vest, estimated at each reporting date based on management’s expectations regarding the relevant performance\ncriteria.\nCompensation expense for stock options is based on the fair value estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model, and is\nrecognized over the vesting period of three to four years. The Company currently uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate\nthe fair value of share-based payment awards for such stock options, which is affected by the Company’s stock price and a number of\nassumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Expected volatility is based on the\nhistorical volatility of the Company’s stock price for a period approximating the expected life. The expected life of an award is based on\ncombining historical exercise data with expected weighted time outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield\navailable on U.S. Treasury issues for the expected life of awards. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s\nexpectation of paying no dividends on its common stock.\nIn accordance with ASC 718, we recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nOther Income, net\nOther income, net consists of miscellaneous income or expense and interest income comprised primarily of interest income on\ninvestments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest expense on our revolving loan and letters of credit balances, deferred financing cost\namortization, and finance lease interest.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 - Income Taxes (“ASC 740”). Under ASC 740, deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using\nenacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\nsettled. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets, which include tax credits and loss carry\nforwards, to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available\npositive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of\nreversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in prior carryback years, tax planning strategies and recent financial\noperations.\nThe Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax\nposition for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be\nsustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest\namount which is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and\nestimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual\noutcomes. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits, interest or penalties related to federal and\nstate income tax matters. The Company’s policy is to record interest and penalties as income tax expense.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities\nThe Company presents taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in accordance with the\nguidance on ASC 606-10-32-2 - Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for leases in accordance with ASC 842 – Leases (“ASC 842”), which requires lessees to record right-of-use\nassets and related right-of-use obligations on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The Company determines if\nan arrangement contains a lease at inception. For purposes of calculating operating lease obligations under the standard, the Company's\nlease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such option.\nThe Company's leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe discount rate used to measure a lease obligation should be the rate implicit in the lease; however, the Company’s operating leases\ngenerally do not provide an implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to\ndetermine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is an entity-specific rate which represents the rate of interest\na lessee would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term with similar payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term.\nForeign Currency Translation\nEffective July 3, 2022, management reassessed our functional currency determination for our Philippines subsidiary in accordance with\nASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, and concluded a change in the functional currency was appropriate from the local currency to the\nU.S. dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, the change in the Philippines subsidiary’s functional currency has been applied on a\nprospective basis in accordance with ASC 830. Effective as of July 3, 2022, foreign currency gains and losses are now included in net loss.\nAny translation gains and losses that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets remain unchanged through July 2, 2022. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are now remeasured into U.S. dollars using\ncurrent exchange rates, except for nonmonetary assets and equity, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses\nare remeasured using average exchange rates during the fiscal year, except for expenses related to nonmonetary assets, which are\nremeasured at historical exchange rates.\nComprehensive Loss\nThe Company reports comprehensive loss in accordance with ASC 220 - Comprehensive Income (“ASC 220”). Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income, included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, includes foreign currency translation adjustments related\nto the Company’s foreign operations through July 2, 2022, unrealized (loss) gain on deferred compensation trust assets, and actuarial (loss)\ngain on the Company’s defined benefit plan in the Philippines. The Company presents the components of net loss and other comprehensive\n(loss) gain in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive operations.\nRecent Accounting Standard Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure, which\nexpands the disclosures required for income taxes. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early\nadopted permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while retrospective application is permitted. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nNote 2 – Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nProvisions of ASC 820 establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers\ninclude:\nLevel 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore, requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nFinancial Assets Valued on a Recurring Basis\nAs of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. These included the Company’s cash and cash equivalents which consist primarily of money market funds and short-term\ninvestments with original maturity dates of three months or less at the date of purchase. The Company determines fair value of these assets\nthrough quoted market prices and as such they are considered Level 1 assets. Level 1 cash and cash equivalents were valued at $50,951 and\n$18,767 as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. During fiscal years 2023 and 2022 there were no transfers into or\nout of Level 1 and Level 2 assets.\nNon-Financial Assets Valued on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring\nbasis. These assets are measured at cost but are written-down to fair value, if necessary, as a result of impairment. As of December 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022, the Company determined long-lived assets, including intangible assets, were not impaired, as such, they were not\nmeasured at fair value.\nNote 3 – Property and Equipment, Net\nThe Company’s property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization expense for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $16,690, $13,607 and $9,895, respectively. The cost and related\naccumulated depreciation of assets retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected\nin earnings. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nDecember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nMachinery and equipment $ 10,150 $ 10,660\nComputer software (purchased and developed) and equipment 24,523 24,143\nVehicles 180 305\nLeasehold improvements 2,751 2,457\nFurniture and fixtures 540 513\nConstruction in process 12,006 10,341\n50,150 48,419\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization (23,761) (24,129)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 26,389 $ 24,290\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nConstruction in process primarily relates to the Company’s internally developed software.\nDepreciation and amortization of property and equipment is calculated by using the straight-line method for financial reporting\npurposes, at rates based on the following estimated useful lives:\nYears\nMachinery and equipment 2 - 5\nComputer software (purchased and developed) 2 - 5\nComputer equipment 2 - 5\nVehicles 3 - 5\nLeasehold improvements* 3 - 5\nFurniture and fixtures 3 - 7\n* The estimated useful life is the lesser of 3-5 years or the lease term, whichever is shorter.\nNote 4 – Borrowings\nThe Company maintains an asset-based revolving Credit Facility that provides for, among other things a revolving commitment, which\nis subject to a borrowing base derived from certain receivables, inventory and property and equipment.\nOn June 17, 2022, the Company and JPMorgan entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit\nAgreement”) amending and restating in its entirety the original Credit Agreement dated April 26, 2012, as amended through the Fourteenth\nAmendment. The Credit Agreement, as amended and restated, provides for the revolving commitment in an aggregated principal amount of\n$75,000 (formerly $30,000) and allows for an uncommitted ability to increase the aggregate principal amount by an additional $75,000 to\n$150,000 (formerly $40,000 maximum) subject to certain terms and conditions. The Credit Facility matures on June 17, 2027.\nAs of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company’s outstanding revolving loan balance was $0, respectively. As of\nDecember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our outstanding standby letters of credit balance was $680 and $620, respectively, and we had\n$0 of our trade letters of credit outstanding in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets.\nLoans drawn under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate equal to either (a) SOFR plus an\napplicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00% per annum based on the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio, or (b) a “an alternate prime base\nrate” subject to an increase from 0.00% to 0.50% per annum based on the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio. As of\nDecember 30, 2023, the Company’s SOFR based interest rate was 7.45% and the Company’s prime based rate was 9.00%. A commitment\nfee, based upon undrawn availability under the Credit Facility bearing interest at a rate of either 0.20% or 0.25% per annum based upon\nundrawn availability, is payable monthly. Under the terms of the terms of the agreement with JPMorgan, cash receipts are deposited into a\nlock-box, which are at the Company’s discretion unless the “cash dominion period” is in effect, during which cash receipts will be used to\nreduce amounts owing under the Credit Agreement. The cash dominion period is triggered in an event of default or if excess availability is\nless than the $9,000 for three consecutive business days, and will continue until, during the preceding 45 consecutive days, no event of\ndefault existed and excess availability has been greater than $9,000 at all times (with the trigger subject to adjustment based on the\nCompany’s revolving commitment). In addition, the Company’s required excess availability related to the “Covenant Testing Trigger\nPeriod” (as defined under the Credit Agreement) is less than $7,500 for three consecutive business days, the Company shall be required to\nmaintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0, and continuing until excess availability has been greater than or equal to\n$7,500 at all times for 45 consecutive days (with the trigger subject to adjustment based on the Company’s revolving commitment).\nCertain of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries are co-borrowers (together with the Company, the “Borrowers”) under the Credit\nAgreement, and certain other domestic subsidiaries are guarantors (the “Guarantors” and, together with\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nthe Borrowers, the “Loan Parties”) under the Credit Agreement. The Borrowers and the Guarantors are jointly and severally liable for the\nBorrowers’ obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Loan Parties’ obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, subject to\ncustomary permitted liens and certain exclusions, by a perfected security interest in (a) all tangible and intangible assets and (b) all of the\ncapital stock owned by the Loan Parties (limited, in the case of foreign subsidiaries, to 65% of the capital stock of such foreign\nsubsidiaries). The Borrowers may voluntarily prepay the loans at any time. The Borrowers are required to make mandatory prepayments of\nthe loans (without payment of a premium) with net cash proceeds received upon the occurrence of certain “prepayment events,” which\ninclude certain sales or other dispositions of collateral, certain casualty or condemnation events, certain equity issuances or capital\ncontributions, and the incurrence of certain debt.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable\nto the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, investments,\ndispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, mergers, and dividends and other distributions. The Credit Agreement requires us to obtain\na prior written consent from JPMorgan when we determine to pay any dividends on or make any distribution with respect to our common\nstock.\nEvents of default under the Credit Agreement include: failure to timely make payments due under the Credit Agreement; material\nmisrepresentations or misstatements under the Credit Agreement and other related agreements; failure to comply with covenants under the\nCredit Agreement and other related agreements; certain defaults in respect of other material indebtedness; insolvency or other related\nevents; certain defaulted judgments; certain ERISA-related events; certain security interests or liens under the loan documents cease to be,\nor are challenged by the Company or any of its subsidiaries as not being, in full force and effect; any loan document or any material\nprovision of the same ceases to be in full force and effect; and certain criminal indictments or convictions of any Loan Party.\nNote 5 – Stockholders’ Equity and Share-Based Compensation\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn July 27, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase\nup to $30 million of the Company’s common stock from time to time. The repurchases of common stock may be executed through open\nmarket purchases, block trades, the implementation of a 10b5-1 plan, and/or any other available methods. During the fiscal year ended\nDecember 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 1,221 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $4,287, excluding commissions, at an\naverage price of $3.51 per share. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common\nstock. The share repurchase program has an expiration date of July 26, 2026.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn May 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), and the ESPP was amended in\nMay 2023. Under the ESPP, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have a certain percentage of their eligible\nearnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or\nthe last business day of the six-month offering period. A total of 750 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the\nESPP. During the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 114 shares and 107 shares, respectively, were issued\nunder the ESPP.\nThe estimated fair value of employee stock purchase rights under the ESPP was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel with the following assumptions:\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nExpected life 0.5 years 0.5 years\nRisk-free interest rate 4.76% - 5.47% 0.19% - 2.52%\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nExpected volatility 44.5% - 71.3% 50.8% - 80.5%\nExpected dividend yield —% —%\nShare-Based Compensation Plan Information\nThe Company adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2016 Equity Plan\") on March 9, 2016, which became effective on May 31,\n2016, following stockholder approval. Subject to adjustment for certain changes in the Company’s capitalization, the aggregate number of\nshares of the Company’s common stock that may be issued under the 2016 Equity Plan will not exceed the sum of (i) two million five\nhundred thousand (2,500) new shares, (ii) the number of unallocated shares remaining available for the grant of new awards under the\nCompany’s prior equity plans described below (the “Prior Equity Plans”) as of the effective date of the 2016 Plan (which was equal to\n3,894 shares as of May 31, 2016) and (iii) any shares subject to a stock award under the Prior Equity Plans that are not issued because such\nstock award expires or otherwise terminates without all of the shares covered by such stock award having been issued, that are not issued\nbecause such stock award is settled in cash, that are forfeited back to or repurchased by the Company because of the failure to meet a\ncontingency or condition required for the vesting of such shares, or that are reacquired, withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding\nobligation in connection with an award or to satisfy the purchase price or exercise price of a stock award. In addition, the share reserve will\nautomatically increase on January 1st of each year, for a period of nine years, commencing on January 1, 2017 and ending on (and\nincluding) January 1, 2026, in an amount equal to one million five hundred thousand (1,500) shares per year; however the Board of\nDirectors of the Company may act prior to January 1st of a given year to provide that there will be no January 1st increase in the share\nreserve for such year or that the increase in the share reserve for such year will be a lesser number of shares of common stock than would\notherwise occur pursuant the automatic increase. Options granted under the 2016 Equity Plan generally expire no later than ten years from\nthe date of grant and generally vest over a period of four years. The exercise price of all option grants must be equal to 100% of the fair\nmarket value on the date of grant. As of December 30, 2023, approximately 1,538 shares were available for future grants under the 2016\nEquity Plan.\nThe following tables summarizes the Company’s stock option activity for the fiscal years ended, and details regarding the options\noutstanding and exercisable as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nExercise Contractual Intrinsic\nShares Price Term (in years) Value(1)\nOptions outstanding, December 31, 2022 3,463 $ 2.25\nGranted — $ —\nExercised (1,673) $ 1.58\nCancelled:\nForfeited (68) $ 2.82\nExpired (29) $ 7.40\nOptions outstanding, December 30, 2023 1,693 $ 2.79 5.03 $ 1,642\nVested and expected to vest at December 30, 2023 1,693 $ 2.79 5.03 $ 1,642\nOptions exercisable, December 30, 2023 1,642 $ 2.71 4.98 $ 1,631\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nExercise Contractual Intrinsic\nShares Price Term (in years) Value(1)\nOptions outstanding, January 1, 2022 4,765 $ 2.17\nGranted — $ —\nExercised (738) $ 1.74\nCancelled:\nForfeited (547) $ 2.16\nExpired (17) $ 4.45\nOptions outstanding, December 31, 2022 3,463 $ 2.25 4.79 $ 14,313\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2022 3,463 $ 2.25 4.79 $ 14,313\nOptions exercisable, December 31, 2022 2,903 $ 2.10 4.38 $ 12,333\n(1) These amounts represent the difference between the exercise price and the closing price of CarParts.com, Inc. common stock at the end\nof the respective fiscal year as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market, for all options outstanding that have an exercise price\ncurrently below the closing price.\nNo stock options were granted under the 2016 Equity Plan during the fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The intrinsic value of stock options\nat the date of the exercise is the difference between the fair value of the stock at the date of exercise and the exercise price. During fiscal\nyears 2023 and 2022, the total intrinsic value of the exercised options was $5,421 and $4,085, respectively. The Company had $107 of\nunrecognized share-based compensation expense related to stock options outstanding as of December 30, 2023, which the expense is\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.44 years.\nRestricted Stock Units\nDuring the fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company granted an aggregate of 2,311 and 2,677 RSUs, respectively, to certain employees\nof the Company. The restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") were granted under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and reduced the pool of equity\ninstruments available under that plan.\nThe vesting of each RSU is subject to the employee’s continued employment through applicable vesting dates. Some RSUs granted to\ncertain executives may vest on an accelerated basis in part or in full upon the occurrence of certain events. The RSUs are accounted for as\nequity awards and are measured at fair value based upon the grant date price of the Company’s common stock. The closing price of the\nCompany’s common stock on each grant date during 2023 ranged from $3.25 to $6.86. The closing price of the Company’s common stock\non each grant during 2022 ranged from $5.30 to $10.99. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period of one-to-three years. Compensation expense for performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) is measured based on the amount of\nshares ultimately expected to vest, estimated at each reporting date based on management’s expectations regarding the relevant\nperformance criteria.\nDuring 2023 there were 1,517 RSUs granted that were time-based and 794 granted that were performance-based. As of\nDecember 30, 2023, the performance criteria established to trigger vesting of PSUs granted in 2023 is still subject to certification by the\nCompensation Committee.\nDuring 2022 there were 1,634 RSUs granted that were time-based and 1,043 granted that were performance-based. As of December\n31, 2022, the performance criteria established to trigger vesting of the PSUs granted in 2022 was met.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, we recorded compensation expense of $11,663 related to RSU’s.

The\nCompany’s effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 differs from the U.S. federal rate primarily as a result of non-deductible\nshare-based compensation, the write-off of expired state net operating loss carryforwards, and the change in the valuation allowance\nmaintained against the Company’s deferred tax assets.\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities consisted of the following:\nDecember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nInventory and inventory related allowance $ 1,605 $ 2,440\nLease liabilities 8,609 11,226\nShare-based compensation 4,024 4,337\nBook over tax depreciation 1,043 —\nIntangibles 90 137\nSales and bad debt allowances 1,130 1,099\nAccrued compensation 127 444\nNet operating loss 29,632 28,728\nOther 47 151\nTotal deferred tax assets 46,307 48,562\nValuation allowance (38,458) (37,565)\nNet deferred tax assets 7,849 10,997\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nRight-of-use assets 7,847 10,506\nTax over book depreciation — 489\nOther 2 2\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 7,849 10,997\nNet deferred tax assets $ — $ —\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 30, 2023, federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards were $105,224 and $84,780, respectively.\nFederal NOL carryforwards of $891 were acquired in the acquisition of WAG which are subject to Internal Revenue Code section 382 and\nlimited to an annual usage limitation of $135. Federal NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2029, while state NOL carryforwards also\nbegin to expire in 2029. The state NOL carryforwards expire in the respective tax years as follows:\n2029 $ 1,814\n2030 9,555\n2031 14,611\n2032 24,202\n2033 24,832\nThereafter 9,766\n$ 84,780\nUnder the provisions of ASC 740, management is required to evaluate whether a valuation allowance should be established against its\ndeferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a “more likely than not” standard. Realization of deferred tax\nassets is dependent upon taxable income in prior carryback years, estimates of future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and reversal\nof existing taxable temporary differences. ASC 740 provides that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult\nwhen there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years or losses expected in early future years. As of December 30,\n2023, mainly due to cumulative losses in recent years, the Company maintained a valuation allowance in the amount of $38,458 against\ndeferred tax assets that were not more likely than not of being realized.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of foreign and state tax jurisdictions. The tax years 2019-2023 remain\nopen to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject, except the Internal Revenue Service for which the\ntax years 2020-2023 remain open. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within\nthe next twelve months.\nIncluded in accrued expenses are income taxes receivable of ($267) and ($67) as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively, consisting primarily of current state taxes. Included in other non-current liabilities are income taxes payable of $1,124 and\n$990 as of December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, relating to accrued future foreign withholding taxes.\nNote 8 – Commitments and Contingencies\nFacilities Leases\nThe Company’s leases its corporate headquarters located in Torrance, California.

A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Automotive Specialty Accessories and Parts, Inc. and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiary Whitney Automotive Group, Inc. (\"WAG\"), are named defendants in several lawsuits involving claims for damages caused by\ninstallation of brakes during the late 1960’s and early 1970’s that contained asbestos. WAG marketed certain brakes, but did not\nmanufacture any brakes. WAG maintains liability insurance coverage to protect its and the Company’s assets from losses arising from the\nlitigation and coverage is provided on an\nF-22\nTable of Contents\noccurrence rather than a claims made basis, and the Company is not expected to incur significant out-of-pocket costs in connection with\nthis matter that would be material to its consolidated financial statements.\nOrdinary course litigation. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business,\nincluding, for example, claims relating to product liability, workplace injuries, intellectual property rights, and employment matters. For\nexample, a worker, who was directly employed by the Company’s third party labor contracting firm at the Company’s Grand Prairie, TX\nwarehouse has filed a negligence claim in the Superior Court of the State of California, Los Angeles County, Central District relating to\na workplace injury from March 2021. The case is in the discovery stage, and trial is currently scheduled for August 2024. The Company\nintends to defend itself vigorously, although there can be no assurance that there will not be some liability. As of the date hereof, the\nCompany believes that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of\noperations or cash flow of the Company. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage to protect the Company’s assets from losses\narising out of or involving activities associated with ongoing and normal business operations.\nRelated Party Matters\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with the Company’s directors and executive officers. These agreements\nrequire the Company to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under law against liabilities that may arise by reason of\ntheir service to the Company, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be\nindemnified.\nNote 9 – Employee Retirement Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan\nEffective February 17, 2006, the Company adopted a 401(k) defined contribution retirement plan covering all full time employees who\nhave completed one month of service. The Company may, at its sole discretion, match fifty cents per dollar up to 6% of each participating\nemployee’s salary. The Company’s contributions vest in annual installments over three years. Discretionary contributions made by the\nCompany totaled $939, $850 and $737 for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn January 2010, the Company adopted the CarParts.com, Inc. Management Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred\nCompensation Plan”), for the purpose of providing highly compensated employees a program to meet their financial planning needs. The\nDeferred Compensation Plan provides participants with the opportunity to defer up to 90% of their base salary and up to 100% of their\nannual earned bonus, all of which, together with the associated investment returns, are 100% vested from the outset. The Deferred\nCompensation Plan, which is designed to be exempt from most provisions of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, is informally\nfunded by the Company through the purchase of mutual funds, held by a rabbi trust. The deferred compensation liabilities (consisting of\nemployer contributions, employee deferrals and associated earnings and losses) are general unsecured obligations of the Company.\nLiabilities under the Deferred Compensation Plan are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of participants’\nselected investments. The Company may at its discretion contribute certain amounts to eligible employee accounts. In January 2010, the\nCompany began to contribute 50% of the first 2% of participants’ eligible contributions into their Deferred Compensation Plan accounts.\nAs of December 30, 2023, the assets and associated liabilities of the Deferred Compensation Plan were $539 and $914, respectively, and\nwere $491 and $697, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and are included in other non-current assets, other current liabilities and other\nnon-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The Deferred Compensation Plan was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2023,\nand the obligations will be paid out in 2024. The interest dividend and realized/unrealized gain/loss for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021\nwas immaterial.\nNote 10 – Product Information\nAs described in detail under “Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Nature of Operations”, the Company’s\nproducts consist of replacement parts serving the wear and tear and body repair market, hard parts to serve\nF-23\nTable of Contents\nthe maintenance and repair market, and performance parts and accessories.

The Report fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and\n2. The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the\nCompany.\nDate: March 7, 2024\n/s/ RYAN LOCKWOOD\nRyan Lockwood\nChief Financial Officer\nCARPARTS.COM, INC.\nINCENTIVE COMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\nDated May 25, 2023\n1. Introduction.\nThe Board of Directors of CarParts.com, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the\nCompany and its stockholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and\nthat reinforces the Company's compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this policy, which\nprovides for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive compensation in the event that the Company is\nrequired to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance of the Company with any\nfinancial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (the “Policy”). This Policy is designed to\ncomply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), related\nrules and the listing standards of NASDAQ or any other securities exchange on which the Company’s shares are\nlisted in the future.\n2. Administration.\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Board or, if so designated by the Board, the Compensation Committee\n(the “Committee”), in which case, all references herein to the Board shall be deemed references to the\nCommittee. Any determinations made by the Board shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\n3. Covered Executives.\nUnless and until the Board determines otherwise, for purposes of this Policy, the term “Covered Executive”\nmeans a current or former employee who is or was identified by the Company as the Company’s president,\nprincipal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller),\nany vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as sales,\nadministration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who\nperforms similar policy-making functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company’s subsidiaries\nare deemed “Covered Executives” if they perform such policy-making functions for the Company. “Policy-\nmaking function” is not intended to include policy-making functions that are not significant. “Covered\nExecutives” will include, at minimum, the executive officers identified by the Company pursuant to Item 401(b)\nof Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. For the avoidance of doubt, “Covered Executives” will include at least\nthe following Company officers: CEO, CFO, COO, and CTO.\nThis Policy covers Incentive Compensation received by a person after beginning service as a Covered\nExecutive and who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for that Incentive\nCompensation.\n4. Recovery: Accounting Restatement.\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements filed with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) due to the Company’s material noncompliance with any\nfinancial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (including any required accounting\nrestatement to correct an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued\nfinancial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current\nperiod or left uncorrected in the current period) (an “Accounting Restatement”), the Company will recover\nreasonably promptly any excess Incentive Compensation received by any Covered Executive during the three\ncompleted fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an\nAccounting Restatement, including transition periods resulting from a change in the Company’s fiscal year as\nprovided in Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act. Incentive Compensation is deemed “received” in the Company’s\nfiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the Incentive Compensation award is\nattained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation occurs after the end of that period. The\ndetermination of the time when the Company is “required” to prepare an Accounting Restatement shall be made\nin accordance with applicable SEC and national securities exchange rules and regulations.\n(a) Definition of Incentive Compensation.\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive Compensation” means any compensation that is granted,\nearned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a “financial reporting measure”\n(as defined in paragraph (b) below), including, for example, bonuses or awards under the\nCompany’s short and long-term incentive plans, grants and awards under the Company’s equity\nincentive plans, and contributions of such bonuses or awards to the Company’s deferred\ncompensation plans or other employee benefit plans that are not tax-qualified plans. For\navoidance of doubt, Incentive Compensation that is deferred (either mandatorily or voluntarily)\nunder the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation plans, as well as any matching\namounts and earnings thereon, are subject to this Policy. Incentive Compensation does not\ninclude awards which are granted, earned and vested without regard to attainment of financial\nreporting measures, such as time-vesting awards, discretionary awards and awards based wholly\non subjective standards, strategic measures or operational measures.\n(b) Financial Reporting Measures.\nFinancial reporting measures are those that are determined and presented in accordance with the\naccounting principles used in preparing the Company’s financial statements (including non-\nGAAP financial measures) and any measures derived wholly or in part from such financial\nmeasures. For the avoidance of doubt, financial reporting measures include stock price and total\nshareholder return. A measure need not be presented within the financial statements or included\nin a filing with the SEC to constitute a financial reporting measure for purposes of this Policy.\n(c) Excess Incentive Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery.\nThe amount(s) to be recovered from the Covered Executive will be the amount(s) by which the\nCovered Executive’s Incentive Compensation for the relevant period(s) exceeded the amount(s)\nthat the Covered Executive otherwise would have received had such Incentive Compensation\nbeen determined based on the restated amounts contained in the Accounting Restatement. All\namounts shall be computed without regard to taxes paid.\nFor Incentive Compensation based on financial reporting measures such as stock price or total\nshareholder return, where the amount of excess compensation is not subject to mathematical\nrecalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the Board will\ncalculate the amount to be reimbursed based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the\nAccounting Restatement on such financial reporting measure upon which the Incentive\nCompensation was received. The Company will maintain documentation of that reasonable\nestimate and will provide such documentation to the applicable national securities exchange.\n(d) Method of Recovery.\nThe Board will determine, in its sole discretion, the method(s) for recovering reasonably\npromptly excess Incentive Compensation hereunder. Such methods may include, without\nlimitation:\n(i) requiring reimbursement of Incentive Compensation previously paid;\n(ii) forfeiting any Incentive Compensation contribution made under the Company’s deferred\ncompensation plans;\n(iii) offsetting the recovered amount from any compensation or Incentive Compensation that\nthe Covered Executive may earn or be awarded in the future;\n(iv) some combination of the foregoing; or\n(v) taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the\nBoard.\n5. No Indemnification or Advance.\nSubject to applicable law, the Company shall not indemnify, including by paying or reimbursing for premiums\nfor any insurance policy covering any potential losses, any Covered Executives against the loss of any\nerroneously awarded Incentive Compensation, nor shall the Company advance any costs or expenses to any\nCovered Executives in connection with any action to recover excess Incentive Compensation.\n6. Interpretation.\nThe Board is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary,\nappropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a\nmanner that is consistent with the requirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or\nstandards adopted by the SEC or any national securities exchange on which the Company's securities are listed.\n7. Effective Date.\nThe effective date of this Policy is May 25, 2023 (the “Effective Date”). This Policy applies to Incentive\nCompensation received by Covered Executives on or after the Effective Date that results from attainment of a\nfinancial reporting measure based on or derived from financial information for any fiscal period ending on or\nafter the Effective Date. Incentive Compensation received by Covered Executives prior to the Effective Date\nremains subject to the Company’s prior Clawback dated August 6, 2019. In addition, this Policy is intended to\nbe and will be incorporated as an essential term and condition of any Incentive Compensation agreement, plan\nor program that the Company establishes or maintains on or after the Effective Date.\n8. Amendment and Termination.\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion, and shall amend this Policy as it deems\nnecessary to reflect changes in regulations adopted by the SEC under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and to\ncomply with any rules or standards adopted by NASDAQ or any other securities exchange on which the\nCompany’s shares are listed in the future.\n9. Other Recovery Rights.\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Board may require that\nany employment agreement or similar agreement relating to Incentive Compensation entered into on or after the\nEffective Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree\nto abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of,\nany (i) other remedies or rights of compensation recovery that may be available to the Company pursuant to the\nterms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, or similar agreement relating to Incentive\nCompensation, unless any such agreement expressly prohibits such right of recovery, and (ii) any other legal\nremedies available to the Company. The provisions of this Policy are in addition to (and not in lieu of) any\nrights to repayment the Company may have under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other\napplicable laws.\n10. Impracticability.\nThe Company shall recover any excess Incentive Compensation in accordance with this Policy, except to the\nextent that certain conditions are met and the Board has determined that such recovery would be impracticable,\nall in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act and NASDAQ or any other securities exchange on\nwhich the Company’s shares are listed in the future.\n11. Successors.\nThis Policy shall be binding upon and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs,\nexecutors, administrators or other legal representatives."

(NASDAQ: PRTS), a leading eCommerce provider of automotive parts and accessories, and a premier destination for vehicle repair and maintenance needs, is reporting results for the third quarter ended September 28, 2024. \n\n[ ![CarParts.com logo \\(PRNewsfoto/CarParts.com, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2449535/Carparts_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2449535/Carparts_logo.html)\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Net sales decreased to $144.8 million, down 13% from the year-ago quarter.\n  * Gross profit of $51.0 million vs. $54.8 million.\n  * Gross margin of 35.2%, up from 32.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n  * Net loss was ($10.0) million, or ($0.17) per share, compared to a net loss of ($2.5) million, or ($0.04) per share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of ($1.2) million vs. $3.0 million.\n  * Cash of $38.1 million and no revolver debt.\n  * Our mobile app has cumulative downloads of over 550,000, more than double the number from the beginning of the year.\n  * New semi-automated Las Vegas distribution center fully operational and handling 20% of company volume.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"Over the last 12 months, we have been working on re-platforming carparts.com to increase performance and shorten our development cycles. I'm proud to announce that carparts.com is now on a best-in-class cloud-based infrastructure which allows us to roll out new features faster than ever.\n\nWe have recently rolled out several strategic initiatives, such as our partnership with SimpleTire, offering a full assortment of tires with installation, our new shipping and product protection offering, and VIN lookup that has 30,000 uses in just two weeks. Although we are early in the journey, all these initiatives are seeing take rates and usage higher than anticipated.\n\nAdditionally, we are happy to announce the launch of our eBay store in Canada with a full assortment of mechanical parts. We are leveraging our best-in-class catalog and marketplaces capabilities to capture incremental revenue in this new global market. Early signs are positive, and as we continue to ramp up, we believe it could become a top line revenue driver.\n\nOn the Amazon front, we have recently completed a pilot, leveraging the Amazon fulfillment network to offer a selection of our private label parts. This program offers amazon shoppers our private label products with fast delivery and Prime badging.\n\nOur OE premium brands are up 24% YOY, our European brands are up 23% YOY, and finally, our wholesale commercial sales channel, excluding the impact of our Vegas move, is up mid-single digits\" said David Meniane, CEO. \n\n**Third Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 were $144.8 million, down 13% from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by deliberate price increases to focus on higher value customers, support gross margin expansion, a continued challenging consumer environment in the industry, and one-time impacts from the Crowd Strike issue and hurricanes Helene and Milton in the quarter.\n\nGross profit in the third quarter was $51.0 million compared to $54.8 million in the year-ago quarter, with gross margin increasing 230 basis points to 35.2%, and up sequentially from 33.5% last quarter. This improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by our price increases and lower product costs resulting in expanded product margins, partially offset by unfavorable freight costs.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter were $60.9 million compared to $57.7 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nNet loss in the third quarter was ($10.0) million compared to a net loss of ($2.5) million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was ($1.2) million compared to $3.0 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOn September 28, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $38.1 million and no revolver debt, compared to no revolver debt and a $51.0 million cash balance at prior fiscal year-end December 30, 2023. \n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nDue to the unexpected and continued impact from hurricanes Helene and Milton, the Company is narrowing and lowering our full year net revenue guidance by $5 million to $595 million to $600 million; however, the Company is narrowing our expected gross margin guidance to the high end of the range, from 32%-34% to 33%-34%.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nCarParts.com CEO David Meniane, CFO Ryan Lockwood and COO Michael Huffaker will host a conference call today to discuss the results, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Tuesday, October 29, 2024Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time) Webcast: [www.carparts.com/investor/news-events](http://www.carparts.com/investor/news-events)\n\nTo listen to the live call, please click the link above to access the webcast. A replay of the audio webcast will be archived on the Company's website at [www.carparts.com/investor](http://www.carparts.com/investor). \n\n**About CarParts.com, Inc.**\n\nCarParts.com, Inc. is a technology-driven eCommerce company offering over 1 million high-quality automotive parts and accessories.

We provide \"Adjusted EBITDA\" in this earnings release and on today's scheduled conference call, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA consist of net loss before (a) interest (income) expense, net; (b) income tax provision; (c) depreciation and amortization expense; (d) amortization of intangible assets; (e) share-based compensation expense; (f) workforce transition costs; and (g) distribution center costs. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss is provided below.\n\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to management and investors. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with the GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and results of operations.\n\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA as measures of the Company's operating performance because it assists in comparing the Company's operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of stock compensation expense as well as other items that we do not believe are representative of our ongoing operating performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; for allocating resources to enhance financial performance; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use these non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to evaluate the ongoing operations of companies in our industry.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. In addition, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items from the Company's non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are all unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\n_This press release contains statements_ _which are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company's business and its industry, as well as certain assumptions made by the Company. These statements are forward looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Words such as \"anticipates,\" \"could,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"potential,\" \"believes,\" \"predicts,\" \"projects,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"will likely continue\" and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future operating results and financial condition, our potential growth, our ability to innovate, our ability to gain market share, and our ability to expand and improve our product offerings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements as a result of various factors._\n\n_Important factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, competitive pressures, our dependence on search engines to attract customers, demand for the Company's products, the online market and channel mix for aftermarket auto parts, the economy in general, increases in commodity and component pricing that would increase the Company's product costs, the operating restrictions in its credit agreement, the weather and any other factors discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including the Risk Factors contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10–K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10–Q, which are available at www.carparts.com/investor and the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
