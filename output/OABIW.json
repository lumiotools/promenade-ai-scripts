(NASDAQ: OABI)** today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and provided operating and partner program updates. \n\n“We are pleased to report another successful quarter demonstrating our continued commitment to innovation with the expansion of our technology platform and a growing partnership portfolio. Third quarter results reflect consistent growth across key metrics, driven by our planned initiatives and the dedication of our team,” said Matt Foehr, Chief Executive Officer of OmniAb. “Our business is well capitalized, and we have a highly scalable model with cutting-edge technologies that are driving significant opportunities. As we move forward, we remain focused on delivering value to our stakeholders and creating sustainable, profitable growth.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.2 million, compared with $5.5 million for the same period in 2023, with the decrease primarily due to timing of milestones and lower ion channel service revenue. \n\nResearch and development expense was $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $13.9 million for the same period in 2023, with the decrease primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense was $7.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $8.5 million for the same period in 2023, with the decrease primarily due to lower legal and share-based compensation expense. \n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.4 million, or $0.16 per share, compared with a net loss of $15.7 million, or $0.16 per share, for the same period in 2023. \n\n**Year-to-Date Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $15.6 million, compared with $29.3 million for the same period in 2023, due to lower milestone revenue primarily related to a $10 million milestone in the prior year period for the first commercial sale of TECVAYLI ® (teclistamab) in the European Union. \n\nResearch and development expense was $41.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was unchanged from the same period in 2023. General and administrative expense was $23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $25.4 million for the same period in 2023, with the decrease primarily due to lower outside service expenses. Amortization of intangible assets increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a $1.2 million impairment related to assets associated with two legacy unpartnered Ab Initio programs. Other operating income, net increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a $2.4 million reduction in contingent liabilities attributed to changes in ion channel programs. \n\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $49.0 million, or $0.48 per share, compared with a net loss of $36.6 million, or $0.37 per share, for the same period in 2023. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, OmniAb had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $59.4 million. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, OmniAb sold 2.0 million shares of common stock through its at-the-market (ATM) program pursuant to the sales agreement with Jefferies. The net proceeds from these sales were $8.5 million. \n\nSubsequent to the end of the third quarter, OmniAb sold 0.7 million shares of common stock through its ATM program for net proceeds of $2.9 million, which will be reflected in its December 31, 2024 financial statements. \n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nOmniAb continues to expect total operating expenses in 2024 to be slightly less than total operating expenses in 2023. \n\nOmniAb now expects to end 2024 with a cash balance in the range of $50 million to $60 million, which includes proceeds from its ATM program. Given the current expected progression of the existing partnered pipeline, OmniAb expects cash use in 2025 to be lower than in 2024 excluding recent ATM program proceeds. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, OmniAb entered into three new platform license agreements including with 92Bio, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Queen Mary University of London. In addition, OmniAb recently expanded its ion channel screening relationship with Syngenta that was initially established last year. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 86 active partners and 352 active programs, including 33 OmniAb-derived programs in clinical development or being commercialized. OmniAb also recently entered into a new platform license agreement with Incyte Corporation. \n\nThird quarter 2024 and recent partner and business highlights include the following: \n\nIMVT-1402\n\n  * Immunovant announced that the Investigational New Drug (IND) application has been cleared for IMVT-1402 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with a potential best-in-class profile in difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA. \n  * Immunovant announced that five IND applications for IMVT-1402 have been cleared across a range of therapeutic areas and U.S. Food & Drug Administration divisions. The company also announced that it is on track to initiate potentially registrational trials with IMVT-1402 in four to five indications, including Graves’ disease (GD) and D2T RA, by March 31, 2025. \n\n\n\nBatoclimab\n\n  * Immunovant reported positive results from the Phase 2a trial of batoclimab in GD. High-dose batoclimab achieved a 76% response rate and a 56% antithyroid drugs (ATD)-free response rate in patients uncontrolled on ATDs at week 12. \n  * Immunovant announced that batoclimab trials in myasthenia gravis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are fully enrolled to support data disclosures by March 31, 2025. Data from batoclimab trials in thyroid eye disease are now expected in the second half of calendar year 2025. All batoclimab data will inform future trials with IMVT-1402. \n\n\n\nAcasunlimab\n\n  * Genmab announced that based on encouraging data from the Phase 2 trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a Phase 3 trial is expected to start before the end date of 2024. \n\n\n\nTEV-53408\n\n  * Teva recently disclosed Phase 1 data for TEV-53408 showing a potential best-in-class profile noting high affinity for IL-15, prolonged suppression of free IL-15, and potential for a low dosing frequency. TEV-53408 was well tolerated in a first-in-human study, and a proof-of-concept study in celiac disease is in progress. Additionally, Teva disclosed the initiation of a clinical study in vitiligo, an autoimmune disease. \n\n\n\nSugemalimab\n\n  * CStone announced that the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved sugemalimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for adult patients with metastatic NSCLC without EGFR-sensitive mutations or ALK, ROS1, RET genomic alterations. \n  * CStone announced long-term survival data for sugemalimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment of stage IV NSCLC at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024. Four-year follow-up data showed that sugemalimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy continues to demonstrate a significant benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy. The four-year survival rate was 32.1% versus 17.3%. \n\n\n\nBC3195\n\n  * BioCity presented interim clinical results on the safety and efficacy of its first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate BC3195, which targets CDH3 (P-Cadherin), in a Phase 1 clinical trial at ESMO 2024. \n  * As of the data cut-off date (August 10, 2024), BC3195 demonstrated impressive antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC with an overall response rate (ORR) of 36.4% (4 of 11 patients). The ORR was 80% (4 of 5 patients) in NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. BC3195 demonstrated manageable safety and tolerability, as well as favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. \n  * BC3195 is currently undergoing concurrent Phase 1 dose-optimization and dose-expansion studies in China. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nOmniAb management will host a conference call with accompanying slides today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss this announcement and answer questions.

(NASDAQ: OABI)** today announced that management will be participating in two investor conferences during the month of November. \n\n  * **Stifel 2024 Healthcare Conference, November 18-19 at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel** . Kurt Gustafson, Chief Financial Officer, will participate in one-on-one meetings with investors on Tuesday, November 19 th . \n\n\n  * **Jefferies London Healthcare Conference, November 19-21 at the Waldorf Hilton** . Matt Foehr, Chief Executive Officer, will participate in one-on-one and small-group meetings with investors on November 19-20. \n\n\n\n**About OmniAb ® **\n\nOmniAb licenses cutting edge discovery research technology to the pharmaceutical and biotech industry to enable the discovery of next-generation therapeutics. Our technology platform creates and screens diverse antibody repertoires and is designed to quickly identify optimal antibodies and other target-binding proteins for our partners’ drug development efforts. At the heart of the OmniAb platform is something we call Biological Intelligence™ (BI), which powers the immune systems of our proprietary, engineered transgenic animals to create optimized antibody candidates for human therapeutics. \n\nWe believe the OmniAb animals comprise the most diverse host systems available in the industry. Our suite of technologies and methods, including computational antigen design and immunization methods, paired with high-throughput single B cell phenotypic screening and mining of next-generation sequencing datasets with custom algorithms, are used to identify fully-human antibodies with exceptional performance and developability characteristics. \n\nOur proprietary transgenic animals, including OmniRat ® , OmniChicken ® and OmniMouse ® have been genetically modified to generate antibodies with human sequences to streamline the development of human therapeutic candidates. OmniFlic ® and OmniClic ® are fixed or common light-chain rats and chickens, respectively, designed to facilitate the discovery of bispecific antibodies. OmniTaur™ provides cow-inspired antibodies with unique structural characteristics for challenging targets. OmnidAb™, is an _in vivo_ platform for the discovery of single domain antibodies based upon a human VH scaffold that affinity matures in a chicken host environment to provide a functionally diverse immune repertoire unavailable from mammalian systems. Our proprietary technologies are joined with and leverage OmniDeep™, which is a suite of _in silico_ , AI and machine learning tools for therapeutic discovery and optimization that are woven throughout our various technologies and capabilities. Additionally, an established core competency focused on ion channels and transporters further differentiates OmniAb’s technology and creates opportunities in many important and emerging target classes. \n\nOmniAb technologies can be leveraged for the discovery of a variety of next-generation antibody-based therapeutic modalities, including bi- and multi-specific biologics, antibody-drug conjugates, CAR-T therapies, targeted radiotherapeutics, and many others. \n\nFor more information, please visit [www.omniab.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.omniab.com&esheet=54144445&newsitemid=20241030117295&lan=en-US&anchor=www.omniab.com&index=1&md5=9027c12b279336b0d93c0b980375d81b). \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241030117295r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nOmniAb, Inc.

Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n1. Organization and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nOmniAb, Inc. (“OmniAb” or the “Company”, formerly known as Avista Public Acquisition Corp. II (“APAC”)) is a biotechnology company that licenses\ncutting edge discovery research technology to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries and academic institutions to enable the discovery of next-generation\ntherapeutics. The Company’s technology platform creates and screens diverse antibody repertoires and is designed to quickly identify optimal antibodies and other\ntarget-binding proteins for its partners’ drug development efforts. At the heart of the OmniAb platform is something the Company calls Biological Intelligence™,\nwhich powers the immune systems of its proprietary, engineered transgenic animals to create optimized antibody candidates for human therapeutics. The Company\nprimarily derives revenue from license fees for technology access, milestones from partnered programs and service revenue from research programs.\nBusiness Combination\nOn November 1, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company, Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“Ligand”), OmniAb Operations,\nInc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Ligand (“Legacy OmniAb”, formerly known as OmniAb, Inc.), and Orwell Merger Sub Inc., a\nDelaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of APAC (“Merger Sub”), consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger\n(the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of March 23, 2022 (the “Business Combination”). See Note 3 – Business Combination for further details.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company’s accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Any reference in these notes\nto applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative U.S. GAAP as included in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards\nUpdates (“ASU”) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, is unaudited but includes all normal and recurring adjustments unless indicated otherwise, which the Company considered necessary for fair presentation of\nits condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements have\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions\nand accounts within the Company have been eliminated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company expects to continue to incur losses as it invests in research and development activities to improve its technology platform, market and sell its\ntechnologies to existing and new partners, add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel to support its operations and incur\nongoing costs associated with operating as a public company. The Company’s ability to continue its operations is dependent upon its ability to generate cash flows\nfrom operations and potentially obtain additional capital in the future. The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the\ncash it expects to generate from operations will provide it the flexibility needed to meet operating, investing, and financing needs and support operations through at\nleast the next 12 months.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which\ncontemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nEmerging Growth Company\nOmniAb qualifies as an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (“Securities Act”), as modified by the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”).\n8\nSection 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards\nuntil private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under\nthe Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the\nextended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. OmniAb\nhas elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public\nor private companies, OmniAb, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised\nstandard. This may make comparison of OmniAb’s financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an\nemerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash and cash equivalents\ngenerally consist of bank deposits, money market funds as well as U.S. government and agency securities. The following table provides a reconciliation of the\ncomponents of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets to the total of the amount presented in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 27,236 $ 16,358\nRestricted cash 560 560\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows $ 27,796 $ 16,918\nRestricted cash relates to deposits for the Company’s property leases. The restriction will lapse when the related leases expire.\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments generally consist of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and U.S. government and agency securities.\nThe Company classifies short-term investments as “available-for-sale” as the sale of such investments may be required prior to maturity to implement management\nstrategies. Therefore, the Company has classified all investments with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets in the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets based upon its ability and intent to use the investments to satisfy the liquidity needs of current operations.\nAny premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income as an adjustment to yield using the straight-line method over the life of\nthe instrument. Investments are reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as\na component of stockholders’ equity until realized.\n9\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable represents the amounts billed to the Company’s partners that are due unconditionally for revenue it has earned. The Company establishes\nan allowance for credit losses to present the net amount of accounts receivable expected to be collected. The allowance requires an estimation based upon historical\nloss experienced and adjusted for factors that are relevant to determining the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Some of these factors include\ndelinquency trends, aging behavior of receivables, credit and liquidity quality indicators for industry groups, customer classes or individual customers and the\ncurrent and expected future economic and market conditions.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review for impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line\nmethod. Amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the related asset. Maintenance and repairs\nare charged to operations as incurred. When assets are sold, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts\nand any gain or loss is included in operating income or expense.\nAsset Estimated Useful Life\nLab and office equipment 4 - 7 years\nComputer hardware 3 - 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of the useful life or remaining lease term\nComputer software Shorter of 3 years or useful life of asset\nAcquisitions\nThe Company first determines whether a set of assets acquired constitutes a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the assets\nacquired are not a business, the Company accounts for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition\nmethod of accounting which requires the Company to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date\nand to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which the Company may adjust the\nprovisional amounts recognized).\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the Company recognizes separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,\nincluding contingent consideration and all contractual contingencies, generally at the acquisition date fair value. Contingent purchase consideration to be settled in\ncash is remeasured to estimated fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in the statement of operations. Costs that the Company\nincurs to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and the\nCompany charges them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred.\nThe Company measures goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which is also measured at fair value, over the net of the\nacquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nShould the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, the Company\nreports provisional amounts in its financial statements. During the measurement period, the Company adjusts the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition\ndate to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement\nof the amounts recognized as of that date and the Company records those adjustments to its financial statements in the period of change, if any.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if the Company identifies changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances\nor liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed\nas of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and the Company records the offset to goodwill. The Company records all\nother changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense.\n10\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least\nannually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. During the goodwill impairment review, the\nCompany assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than the carrying amount,\nincluding goodwill. The Company operates in one reporting unit. The qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and\nmarket considerations, cost factors, the overall financial performance, and events affecting the reporting unit. If, after assessing the totality of these qualitative\nfactors, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then no additional\nassessment is deemed necessary. Otherwise, the Company proceeds to perform the quantitative assessment. The Company will then evaluate goodwill for\nimpairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill. To determine the fair value, the\nCompany generally uses a combination of market approach based on OmniAb and comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses and the\nincome approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. The Company’s cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating\ncosts and other relevant factors. The Company may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in a period and elect to proceed to perform the quantitative\nassessment for the goodwill impairment test. The Company performs its annual assessment for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter each year. No\nimpairment indicators were noted in any periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements under the qualitative assessment.\nThe Company’s identifiable intangible assets are composed of acquired core technologies, licensed technologies, contractual relationships, customer\nrelationships and trade names. Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets’ respective estimated\nuseful life. The Company regularly performs reviews to determine if any event has occurred that may indicate that intangible assets with finite useful lives and\nother long-lived assets are potentially impaired. If indicators of impairment exist, an impairment test is performed to assess the recoverability of the affected assets\nby determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the affected assets are not recoverable, the\nCompany estimates the fair value of the assets and records an impairment loss if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Factors that may indicate\npotential impairment include market conditions, industry and economic trends, changes in regulations, clinical success, historical and forecasted financial results,\nsignificant changes in the ability of a particular asset to generate positive cash flows, and the pattern of utilization of a particular asset. Other than an impairment of\nthe Company’s finite-lived intangible assets related to certain legacy assets from Ligand’s acquisition of Ab Initio Biotherapeutics, Inc. (“Ab Initio”) in July 2019,\nas further described in Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, the Company did not identify indicators of impairment for its other intangible and long-lived\nassets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nPublic, Private Placement, Forward Purchase and Backstop Common Stock Warrants\nThe Company assumed 7,666,667 warrants originally issued in APAC’s initial public offering (the “Public Warrants”) and 8,233,333 warrants issued in a\nprivate placement that closed concurrently with APAC’s initial public offering, (the “Private Placement Warrants”) in the Business Combination. Additionally, as\nfurther discussed in Note 3 – Business Combination, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Forward Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 23, 2022 (the “A&R\nFPA”), on the Closing Date, the Company issued 1,666,667 warrants in the Forward Purchase (the “Forward Purchase Warrants”) and 1,445,489 warrants in the\nRedemption Backstop (the “Backstop Warrants”). The Public, Private Placement, Forward Purchase and Backstop Warrants entitle the holder to purchase one share\nof the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share.\nThe Public Warrants are publicly traded and are exercisable for cash unless certain conditions occur, such as the failure to have an effective registration\nstatement related to the shares issuable upon exercise or redemption by the Company under certain conditions, at which time the warrants may be cashless exercised\nat the option of the Company. The Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to the Public Warrants except that the Private Placement\nWarrants were not transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination. The Private Placement Warrants will be\nredeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The Forward Purchase Warrants\nand the Backstop Warrants have the same terms as the Private Placement Warrants.\nThe Company evaluated the Public, Private Placement, Forward Purchase and Backstop Warrants under ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in\nEntity’s Own Equity (“ASC 815-40”), and concluded they meet the criteria for equity classification as they are considered to be indexed to the Company’s own\nstock.\n11\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company applies the following five-step model in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in order to determine revenue: (i)\nidentification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including\nwhether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation\nof the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThe Company’s revenue is typically derived from license agreements with its partners and consists of: (i) upfront or annual payments for technology access\n(license revenue), (ii) payments for the performance of research services (service revenue), (iii) downstream payments in the form of preclinical, intellectual\nproperty, clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones (milestone revenue) and (iv) royalties on net sales from partners’ product sales (royalty revenue).\nLicense fees are recognized when (or as) control of a performance obligation is transferred to the customer. When combined performance obligations contain a\npromised license and related services or other promises, management judgment is required to determine whether revenue is recognized at a point in time or over\ntime. If a license for technology access is deemed to be the predominant promise in a performance obligation, the Company first determines the nature of the\nlicense, whether functional or symbolic intellectual property, to conclude whether revenue recognition as of a point in time or over time is most appropriate. The\ndetermination of functional or symbolic intellectual property requires an assessment of whether the customer is able to benefit from the license in its current\ncondition, or if the utility of the license is dependent on or influenced by the Company’s ongoing activities.\nThe Company recognizes service revenue for contracted R&D services performed for partners over time. The Company measures its progress using an input\nmethod based on the effort it expends or costs it incurs relative to the estimated total effort or costs to satisfy the performance obligation. This results in a\npercentage that it multiplies by the transaction price to determine the amount of revenue recognized each period. This approach requires the Company to make\nestimates and use judgment. If estimates or judgments change over the course of the collaboration, they may affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized in\ncurrent and future periods.\nThe Company includes contingent milestone based payments in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the\npayment and it is probable of being achieved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated results and its best judgment at the time. If the\ncontingent milestone based payment is sales-based, we apply the royalty recognition constraint and record revenue when the underlying sale has taken place.\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for licenses of intellectual property. Because of the risk that products in development with\npartners will not reach development based milestones or receive regulatory approval, the Company generally recognizes any contingent payments that would be due\nto it upon or after achievement of the development milestone or regulatory approval.\nDeferred Revenue\nDepending on the terms of the arrangement, the Company may also defer a portion of the consideration received if it needs to satisfy a future obligation.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer\nadvances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company generally receives payment at the point it satisfies its\nobligation or soon after. Any fees billed in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue. During each of the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the amount recognized as revenue that was previously deferred at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $1.4 million and $6.1 million,\nrespectively. During each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the amount recognized as revenue that was previously deferred at June 30, 2023\nand December 31, 2022 was $2.3 million and $4.8 million, respectively.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe disaggregated revenue categories are presented on the face of the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n12\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of material, equipment, facilities and labor costs of scientific staff who are working pursuant to collaborative\nagreements and other research and development projects. Also included in research and development expenses are third-party costs incurred for research programs\nincluding in-licensing costs, and costs incurred by other research and development service vendors. The Company expenses these costs as they are incurred. When\nthe Company makes payments for research and development services prior to the services being rendered, it records those amounts as prepaid expenses on its\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets and it expenses them as the services are provided.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the\nawards, taking into consideration forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined by the closing market price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the date of grant. Performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) generally represent the right to receive a certain number of\nshares of common stock based on the achievement of the Company’s corporate performance or market goals and continued employment during the vesting period.\nShare-based compensation expense for market-based PRSUs is measured using the Monte-Carlo valuation model and is not adjusted for the achievement, or lack\nthereof, of market conditions.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and stock purchases under the ESPP. The model\nassumptions include expected volatility, term, dividends, and the risk-free interest rate.\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for shares to be issued under its employee stock purchase plan based on an estimated grant date\nfair value recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company provides for income taxes under the asset and liability method prescribed by the ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“Topic 740”). Deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax\nrates in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. If necessary, deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty\nassociated with their ultimate realization.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Topic\n740 by prescribing a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax\nreturn. When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be\nrealized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as\nconsideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjusts the level of the liability to\nreflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Any changes to these estimates, based on the actual results obtained and/or\na change in assumptions, could affect its income tax provision in future periods. Interest and penalty charges, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits would be\nclassified as a provision for income tax in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome (Loss) Per Share\nBasic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted income (loss) per share is computed based on the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares\noutstanding during the period.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) represents net income (loss) adjusted for the change during the periods presented in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-\nsale debt securities and reclassification adjustments for realized gains or losses included in net income (loss). The unrealized gains or losses are reported in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n13\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified\neffective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards are either not applicable to the Company or will\nnot have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nThe following table provides a brief description of recently issued accounting standards:\nEffect on the Financial Statements or Other\nStandard Description Effective Date Significant Matters\nASU 2023-07, Effective for the Company for\nSegment Reporting fiscal years beginning after The Company is currently evaluating the\nASU 2023-07 updates reportable segment disclosure\n(Topic 280) - December 15, 2023, and impact of adopting this standard on its\nrequirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nImprovements to interim periods within fiscal consolidated financial statements and\nsignificant segment expenses.\nReportable Segment years beginning after December disclosures.\nDisclosures 15, 2024.\nThe amendments in this ASU address investor requests for\nASU 2023-09,\nmore transparency about income tax information through Effective for the Company for The Company is currently evaluating the\nIncome Taxes (Topic\nimprovements to tax disclosures primarily related to the rate annual periods beginning after impact of adopting this standard on its\n740) - Improvements\nreconciliation and income taxes paid information.

Business Combination\nIn connection with, and as contemplated by, the Merger Agreement, on November 1, 2022, in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution\nAgreement, dated as of March 23, 2022, by and among APAC, Ligand and Legacy OmniAb (the “Separation Agreement”), Ligand transferred the Legacy OmniAb\nbusiness to Legacy OmniAb and made a contribution to the capital of Legacy OmniAb of $1.8 million, after deducting certain transaction and other expenses\nreimbursable by Legacy OmniAb (the “Separation”). Following the Separation, Ligand distributed on a pro rata basis to its stockholders all of the shares of\ncommon stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Legacy OmniAb (“Legacy OmniAb Common Stock”) held by Ligand, such that each holder of shares of common\nstock, par value $0.001 per share, of Ligand (“Ligand Common Stock”) was entitled to receive one share of Legacy OmniAb Common Stock for each share of\nLigand Common Stock held by such holder as of the record date for the distribution, October 26, 2022 (the “Distribution”). Following the Separation and\nDistribution, on November 1, 2022, Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy OmniAb, with Legacy OmniAb surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of\nOmniAb.\nAt the Closing Date, each outstanding share of Legacy OmniAb Common Stock was cancelled in exchange for 4.90007 shares of common stock of OmniAb,\npar value $0.0001 per share (“OmniAb Common Stock”) and 0.75842 shares of OmniAb Common Stock subject to certain price-based earnout triggers (the\n“Earnout Shares”). Holders of shares of Legacy OmniAb Common Stock received an aggregate 82,611,789 shares of the OmniAb Common Stock, excluding\nEarnout Shares, as consideration in the Business Combination.\nIn addition, all outstanding Legacy OmniAb equity awards were converted into OmniAb equity awards to purchase, in the case of options, or receive, in the\ncase of restricted stock units and performance-vesting restricted stock units, shares of OmniAb Common Stock, in each case, equal to the number of shares\nunderlying such Legacy OmniAb equity awards multiplied by 4.90007. Each holder of an outstanding Legacy OmniAb equity award also received Earnout Shares\nequal to the number of shares of Legacy OmniAb Common Stock underlying such equity award multiplied by 0.75842.\n14\nHolders of shares of Legacy OmniAb Common Stock and holders of Legacy OmniAb equity awards received an aggregate 14,999,243 Earnout Shares as\nconsideration in the Business Combination. Fifty percent of the Earnout Shares will vest on the date on which the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) equals\nor exceeds $12.50 on any 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading-day period, and all remaining Earnout Shares will vest on the date on which the VWAP\nequals or exceeds $15.00 on any 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading-day period, in each case provided such vesting occurs during the five year period\nfollowing the Closing Date (the “Earnout Period”); provided, that in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Merger Agreement) during the Earnout\nPeriod pursuant to which OmniAb or any of its stockholders have the right to receive, directly or indirectly, cash, securities or other property attributing a value of\nat least $12.50 (with respect to 50% of the Earnout Shares) or $15.00 (with respect to all Earnout Shares) per share of OmniAb Common Stock, and such Change of\nControl has been approved by a majority of the independent directors of the OmniAb board of directors, then such Earnout Shares shall be deemed to have vested\nimmediately prior to such Change of Control. The Earnout Shares are accounted for as equity-classified equity instruments and recorded in additional paid-in\ncapital as part of the Business Combination.\nPursuant to the Sponsor Insider Letter Agreement executed concurrently with the Merger Agreement, by and among APAC, Avista Acquisition LP II (the\n“Sponsor”), Legacy OmniAb and certain insiders of APAC, 1,293,299 shares of OmniAb Common Stock held by the Sponsor became subject to the same price-\nbased vesting conditions as the Earnout Shares (the “Sponsor Earnout Shares”). The Sponsor Earnout Shares are accounted for as equity-classified equity\ninstruments and recorded in additional paid-in capital as part of the Business Combination.\nOn the Closing Date, the Company completed the issuance and sale of 1,500,000 shares of the OmniAb Common Stock and 1,666,667 Forward Purchase\nWarrants to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $15.0 million (the “Forward Purchase”), pursuant to the amended and restated forward purchase\nagreement (the “A&R FPA”). Additionally, and also pursuant to the A&R FPA, on the Closing Date, the Company completed the sale of 8,672,934 shares of the\nOmniAb Common Stock and 1,445,489 Backstop Warrants to the Sponsor for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and aggregate purchase price of $86.7 million in\norder to backstop shareholder redemptions which would have otherwise resulted in the cash proceeds available to OmniAb following the Business Combination\nfrom OmniAb’s trust account to be less than $100,000,000. Refer to Note 9 – Stockholders' Equity, for additional information on the accounting for the Forward\nPurchase Warrants and Backstop Warrants.\n4. Fair Value Measurement\nThe Company measures its financial assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received from selling an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe Company uses the following three-level valuation hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to\nvalue its financial assets and liabilities:\n• Level 1 — Observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.\n• Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n• Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assumptions.\n15\nFinancial Instruments Measured on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables provide a summary of the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\nFair Value Measurements as of\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 17,003 $ — $ — $ 17,003\nTotal cash equivalents $ 17,003 $ — $ — $ 17,003\nShort-term investments:\nGovernment and agency securities $ 29,998 $ 1,508 $ — $ 31,506\nAsset-backed securities — 639 — 639\nTotal short-term investments $ 29,998 $ 2,147 $ — $ 32,145\nLiabilities:\nCurrent contingent liabilities $ — $ — $ 510 $ 510\nLong-term contingent liabilities — — 1,111 1,111\nTotal contingent liabilities $ — $ — $ 1,621 $ 1,621\nFair Value Measurements as of\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds $ 12,289 $ — $ — $ 12,289\nTotal cash equivalents $ 12,289 $ — $ — $ 12,289\nShort-term investments:\nGovernment and agency securities $ 63,109 $ 4,998 $ — $ 68,107\nAsset-backed securities — 2,518 — 2,518\nTotal short-term investments $ 63,109 $ 7,516 $ — $ 70,625\nLiabilities:\nCurrent contingent liabilities $ — $ — $ 1,303 $ 1,303\nLong-term contingent liabilities — — 3,203 3,203\nTotal contingent liabilities $ — $ — $ 4,506 $ 4,506\nThe carrying amounts reported in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets for accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable and other\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short periods to maturity.\n16\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\nThe Company obtains the fair value of its Level 2 available-for-sale securities from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard\nvaluation models whereby all significant inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, bids, offers, or other market-\nrelated data, are observable. The Company validates the prices provided by the third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and obtaining market\nvalues from other pricing sources. The Company did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by these pricing services as of September 30,\n2024 or December 31, 2023. The Company has not transferred any investment securities between classification levels.\nContingent Liabilities\nContingent liabilities are measured at fair value each reporting period by using a probability weighted income approach.\nA reconciliation of the Level 3 financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\n(in thousands) Icagen(1) Taurus(2) xCella(2) Total\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 $ 4,747 $ 1,600 $ 1,764 $ 8,111\nPayments to CVR holders (300) (1,600) (2,840) (4,740)\nFair value adjustments to contingent liabilities (341) 400 1,076 1,135\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 4,106 400 — 4,506\nPayments to CVR holders (75) (400) — (475)\nFair value adjustments to contingent liabilities (2,410) — — (2,410)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 1,621 $ — $ — $ 1,621\n_____________\n(1) Changes in the fair values of contingent liabilities in connection with the acquisition of Icagen are recognized in “Other operating expense (income), net” in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and in the operating section of the statements of cash flows. Payments to CVR holders are disclosed in the financing section of the\nstatements of cash flows.\n(2) Changes in the fair values of contingent liabilities in connection with the acquisitions of Taurus and xCella are recognized in “Intangible assets, net” in the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. Payments to CVR holders are disclosed in the investing section of the statement of cash flows.\nContingent liabilities are classified as Level 3 liabilities as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently\nobservable in the market. These subjective estimates include but are not limited to assumptions involving the achievement probability of certain developmental and\ncommercialization milestones, discount rates, and projected years of payments. If different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation\napproaches, the estimated fair value could be materially higher or lower than the fair value determined.\nAssets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company applies fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis associated with valuing potential impairment losses related to goodwill, finite-lived\nintangible assets, and long-lived assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded an impairment of its finite-lived intangible\nassets related to certain legacy assets from Ligand’s acquisition of Ab Initio in July 2019, as further described in Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net. No\nfair value impairment was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n5. Short-Term Investments\nThe Company classified short-term investments as available-for-sale securities, as the sale of such investments may be required prior to maturity to implement\nmanagement strategies. The following tables summarize short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n17\nAs of September 30, 2024\nUnrealized\nEstimated\n(in thousands) Amortized Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nGovernment and agency securities $ 31,457 $ 50 $ (1) $ 31,506\nAsset-backed securities 639 — — 639\nTotal short-term investments $ 32,096 $ 50 $ (1) $ 32,145\nAs of December 31, 2023\nUnrealized\nEstimated\n(in thousands) Amortized Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nGovernment and agency securities $ 68,054 $ 57 $ (4) $ 68,107\nAsset-backed securities 2,522 — (4) 2,518\nTotal short-term investments $ 70,576 $ 57 $ (8) $ 70,625\nThe Company classified all investments with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as short-term investments in the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets based upon its ability and intent to use the investments to satisfy the liquidity needs of current operations. The following table\nsummarizes available-for-sale investments by maturity as of September 30, 2024:\n(in thousands) Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value\nDue in one year or less $ 32,096 $ 32,145\nDue after one year — —\nTotal short-term investments $ 32,096 $ 32,145\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s available-for-sale investments’ gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and\nlength of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nLess than 12 months More than 12 months Total\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\n(in thousands) Count Value Losses Count Value Losses Count Value Losses\nGovernment and agency securities 1 $ 1,508 $ (1) — $ — $ — 1 $ 1,508 $ (1)\nAsset-backed securities — — — — — — — — —\n1 $ 1,508 $ (1) — $ — $ — 1 $ 1,508 $ (1)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months More than 12 months Total\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\n(in thousands) Count Value Losses Count Value Losses Count Value Losses\nGovernment and agency securities 5 $ 10,402 $ (4) — $ — $ — 5 $ 10,402 $ (4)\nAsset-backed securities 3 2,518 (4) — — — 3 2,518 (4)\n8 $ 12,920 $ (8) — $ — $ — 8 $ 12,920 $ (8)\n18\nThe Company had certain available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position without an allowance for credit loss as of September 30, 2024.\nUnrealized losses on these debt securities have not been recognized into income because (1) the issuers have high credit quality, (2) management does not intend to\nsell and it is likely that management will not be required to sell these securities prior to their anticipated recovery and (3) the decline in fair value is largely due to\nmarket conditions and/or changes in interest rates. The issuers continue to make timely interest payments on the securities, and the fair value is expected to recover\nas the bonds approach maturity.\n6. Balance Sheet Account Details\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLeasehold improvements $ 17,746 $ 16,077\nLab and office equipment 9,787 9,452\nComputer hardware and software 754 754\nConstruction in progress — 842\nProperty and equipment, at cost 28,287 27,125\nLess accumulated depreciation (11,954) (8,876)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 16,333 $ 18,249\nDepreciation expense, which is included in operating expense, was $1.0 million and $3.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and $1.0 million and $3.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCompensation $ 4,638 $ 5,247\nDue to former parent Ligand 439 1,234\nProfessional service fees 189 431\nRoyalties owed to third parties 116 139\nOther 64 17\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 5,446 $ 7,068\n7.

Amortization expense of $3.4 million and $11.3\nmillion was recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Amortization expense was $3.4 million and $10.1 million during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined that certain of its finite-lived intangible assets related to the acquisition of Ab\nInitio in July 2019 were fully impaired, and recorded a $1.2 million write-off of the net carrying value, which is recorded as “Amortization of intangibles” in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe remaining weighted-average useful life of definite lived intangible assets is 11.2 years. At September 30, 2024, future amortization expense on intangible\nassets is estimated to be as follows (in thousands):\nMaturity Dates Amount\nRemaining three months ended December 31, 2024 $ 3,393\n2025 13,452\n2026 13,412\n2027 13,412\n2028 13,412\nThereafter 87,038\nTotal future amortization expense $ 144,119\n8.

It leases approximately 70,000 square feet of space under leases expiring from 2026 to 2032.\nThe below tables provide supplemental cash flow and other information related to operating leases (in thousands, except for lease term and discount rate):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: $ 2,563 $ 2,442\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: $ 39 $ 328\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.1 8.0\nWeighted average discount rate 4.3 % 4.3 %\nIn addition to base rent, certain of the Company’s operating leases require variable payments. These variable lease costs include amounts relating to common\narea maintenance and are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred and are recognized as operating expenses in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. The following table summarizes the components of operating lease expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023:\n20\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease cost 799 802 2,393 2,378\nVariable lease cost 519 364 1,337 1,070\nTotal lease costs 1,318 1,166 3,730 3,448\nFuture minimum lease commitments are as follows as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nMaturity Dates Operating Leases\nRemaining three months ended December 31, 2024 $ 930\n2025 3,782\n2026 3,879\n2027 3,980\n2028 4,107\nThereafter 11,299\nTotal lease payments 27,977\nLess imputed interest (4,138)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 23,839\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company has been and may be involved in various legal proceedings arising in its ordinary course of business. In the opinion of\nmanagement, resolution of any pending claims (either individually or in the aggregate) is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, cash flows or financial position and it is not possible to provide an estimated amount of any such loss. However, the outcome of\ndisputes is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, an unfavorable resolution of one or\nmore matters could materially affect future results of operations or cash flows, or both, in a particular period.\n9. Stockholders' Equity\nAuthorized and Outstanding Capital Stock\nThe total number of shares of the Company’s authorized capital stock is 1,100,000,000. The total amount of authorized capital stock consists of 1,000,000,000\nshares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, no shares of preferred stock are issued or outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nHolders of OmniAb Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of\ndirectors, and do not have cumulative voting rights. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any then outstanding preferred stock, holders of OmniAb\nCommon Stock are entitled to receive ratably those dividends, if any, as may be declared by the Company’s board of directors out of legally available funds. In the\nevent of liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of OmniAb Common Stock will be entitled to share ratably in the assets legally available for distribution\nto stockholders after the payment of or provision for all of the Company's debts and other liabilities, subject to the prior rights of any preferred stock then\noutstanding.

The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and\nother corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in the Company’s control and may adversely\naffect the market price of OmniAb Common Stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of OmniAb Common Stock. The Company has no current plans to\nissue any shares of preferred stock.\nEarnout Shares\nAs of September 30, 2024, OmniAb Earnout Shares of 14,999,243 and Sponsor Earnout Shares of 1,293,299 are issued and outstanding.

The Earnout Shares are not transferable until the vesting condition for the applicable tranche of Earnout Shares has been achieved. Prior to\nvesting, holders of Earnout Shares are entitled to exercise the voting rights carried by such shares and receive any dividends or other distributions in respect of such\nshares.\nThe Earnout Shares will be automatically forfeited for no consideration if the vesting condition for the applicable tranche of Earnout Shares has not been\nsatisfied on or before November 1, 2027.\nWarrants\nAs part of APAC’s initial public offering, 7,666,667 Public Warrants were sold. The Public Warrants entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of common\nstock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustments. The Public Warrants are only exercisable for a whole number of shares of common stock. No fractional\nshares are to be issued upon exercise of the warrants. The Public Warrants will expire on November 1, 2027 at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon\nredemption or liquidation. The Public Warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “OABIW”.\nAdditionally, the Company can redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:\n• in whole and not in part;\n• at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n• upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and\n• if, and only if, the closing price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations,\nreorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three trading days before the Company sends\nthe notice of redemption to the warrant holders provided there was an effective registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon\nexercise of the warrants.\nIf the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption as previously described, the Company has the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the\nPublic Warrants to do so on a cashless basis.\n22\nSimultaneously with APAC’s initial public offering, APAC consummated a private placement of 8,233,333 Private Placement Warrants with APAC’s sponsor.\nEach Private Placement Warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Private Placement Warrants\nhave terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Public Warrants except that the Private Placement Warrants were not transferable, assignable or salable\nuntil 30 days after the completion of the Business Combination. The Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios\nand exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\nAdditionally, on the Closing Date, the Company issued 1,666,667 Forward Purchase Warrants and 1,445,489 Backstop Warrants pursuant to the A&R FPA. The\nForward Purchase Warrants and Backstop Warrants have the same terms as the Private Placement Warrants.\nThe Company concluded the Public, Private Placement, Forward Purchase and Backstop Warrants meet the criteria to be classified as equity. Upon\nconsummation of the Business Combination, the Public, Private Placement, Forward Purchase and Backstop Warrants were recorded in additional paid-in capital.\nEquity Compensation Plans\n2022 Incentive Award Plan\nThe Company’s board of directors and stockholders adopted the 2022 Incentive Award Plan, or the 2022 Plan, which became effective upon the Closing of the\nBusiness Combination. Under the 2022 Plan, the Company may grant cash and equity incentive awards to eligible employees, directors and consultants.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the 2022 Plan is 29,629,470 shares. In addition, the\nnumber of shares of our common stock available for issuance under the 2022 Plan will be annually increased on January 1 of each calendar year beginning in 2023\nand ending in 2032 by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) a number equal to 5% of the fully-diluted shares on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar\nyear or (ii) such smaller number of shares as is determined by the Company's board of directors.\nThe 2022 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nstock, dividend equivalents, RSUs and other stock or cash-based awards.\nOmniAb Prior Plans\nIn connection with the Business Combination, Legacy OmniAb adopted the OmniAb, Inc. 2022 Ligand Service Provider Assumed Award Plan and the\nOmniAb, Inc. 2022 OmniAb Service Provider Assumed Award Plan, collectively referred to as the OmniAb Prior Plans, which govern the OmniAb equity awards\nissued upon adjustment of outstanding Ligand equity awards in connection with the Distribution. All awards under the OmniAb Prior Plans that were outstanding as\nof the closing of the Business Combination continued to be governed by the terms, conditions and procedures set forth in the OmniAb Prior Plans and any\napplicable award agreements, as those terms may be equitably adjusted in connection with the Business Combination. The Company assumed the OmniAb Prior\nPlans in connection with the closing of the Business Combination, and each of the awards thereunder.\nAt the Market Offering\nIn December 2023, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “Sales Agreement”), with Jefferies LLC (the “Sales Agent”) under which\nit may, from time to time, sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million in “at the market” (“ATM”) offerings through\nthe Sales Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the Sales\nAgent. The Sales Agent will receive a commission from the Company of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sales\nAgreement. Sales of its common stock made pursuant to the Sales Agreement are made under its shelf registration statement on Form S‐3 which was filed on\nDecember 8, 2023 and declared effective by the SEC on December 18, 2023. The Company is not obligated to sell, and the Sales Agent is not obligated to buy or\nsell, any shares of common stock under the Sales Agreement.

Share-Based Compensation\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company recognized share-based compensation expense by function as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nGeneral and administrative $ 2,733 $ 3,113 $ 8,266 $ 9,106\nResearch and development 2,572 3,197 8,117 9,788\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 5,305 $ 6,310 $ 16,383 $ 18,894\nThe Company recognized share-based compensation expense by award type as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock options $ 3,659 $ 3,866 $ 11,162 $ 11,461\nRestricted stock units 1,429 2,001 4,421 5,882\nPerformance restricted stock units 154 154 460 458\nEmployee share purchase plan 63 289 340 1,093\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 5,305 $ 6,310 $ 16,383 $ 18,894\nStock Options\nStock options granted under the 2022 Plan typically vest 1/8 on the six-month anniversary of the date of grant, and 1/48 each month thereafter for 42 months.\nAll option awards generally expire 10 years from the date of grant.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted. The model assumptions include expected\nvolatility, expected term, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate.\n• Expected volatility: Due to the Company’s limited trading history for its common stock, the expected volatility assumption is based on volatilities of a peer\ngroup of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available. The peer group was developed based on companies in the biotechnology industry.\nThe Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes\navailable.\n• Expected term: The expected term represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. Because the Company has limited historical\nexercise behavior, it determines the expected life assumption using the simplified method which is an average of the contractual term of the option and its\nvesting period.\n• Dividend yield: The Company bases the expected dividend yield assumption on the fact that it has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention\nto pay cash dividends and, therefore, used an expected dividend yield of zero.\n• Risk-free interest rate: The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share-\nbased awards.\nThe fair value of each option issued to employees was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-\naverage assumptions:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRisk-free interest rate 4.1 % 4.3 % 4.3 % 3.6 %\nExpected volatility 55.7 % 50.7 % 54.4 % 50.1 %\nExpected term (years) 6.0 6.1 6.0 6.1\nDividend yield — % — % — % — %\n24\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity awarded to OmniAb employees and directors under the Company’s equity award plans:\nWeighted-Average\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Aggregate Intrinsic\nShares Exercise Price per Share Life (in years) Value (in thousands)(1)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 14,795,859 $ 6.50\nGranted 3,170,425 $ 5.50\nExercised (472,035) $ 3.65\nCancelled/Expired (475,134) $ 6.12\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 17,019,115 $ 6.40 8.0 $ 4,205\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 7,483,410 $ 7.84 7.4 $ 1,568\n_____________\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the estimated fair value of the common stock for in the\nmoney options at September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to OmniAb options was $24.6 million, which is expected to be recognized\nover a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.25 years. As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to\nLigand options was $0.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 0.34 years.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of OmniAb options exercised by OmniAb employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.5 million. Cash\nreceived from OmniAb options exercised by OmniAb employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.5 million.\nThere were no OmniAb options exercised by Ligand employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRSUs generally represent the right to receive a certain number of shares of common stock subject to certain vesting conditions and other restrictions. RSUs\ngenerally vest over three years. The fair value of RSUs is determined by the closing market price on the grant date.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 under the Company’s equity awards plans:\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair\nShares Value\nUnvested balance at January 1, 2024 1,878,381 $ 5.61\nGranted 906,064 $ 5.41\nVested (632,505) $ 7.43\nForfeited (81,438) $ 4.26\nUnvested balance at September 30, 2024 2,070,502 $ 5.01\nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to OmniAb RSUs was $7.0 million, which is expected to be recognized\nover a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 1.29 years. As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to\nLigand RSUs was negligible.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of OmniAb RSUs vested for OmniAb employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.4 million. The\naggregate intrinsic value of OmniAb RSUs vested for Ligand employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.7 million.\n25\nPerformance Restricted Stock Units\nPRSUs generally represent the right to receive a certain number of shares of common stock based on the achievement of the Company’s corporate performance\nor market goals and continued employment during the vesting period.\nThe Company’s PRSUs contain a market condition dependent upon the Company’s relative and absolute total stockholder return over a three-year period, with\na payout range of 0% to 200% of the target shares granted. Share-based compensation expense for these PRSUs is measured using the Monte-Carlo valuation model\nand is not adjusted for the achievement, or lack thereof, of the market conditions.\nThe following table summarizes the PRSU activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, under the Company’s equity awards plans:\nWeighted-Average Grant Date Fair\nShares Value\nUnvested balance at January 1, 2024 94,749 $ 16.11\nGranted — $ —\nVested — $ —\nForfeited — $ —\nUnvested balance at September 30, 2024 94,749 $ 16.11\nAs of September 30, 2024, unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to OmniAb PRSUs was $0.2 million, which is expected to be recognized\nover a remaining weighted-average period of approximately 0.25 years.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the Company’s 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), eligible employees are entitled to purchase shares of common stock at a discount\nwith accumulated payroll deductions. The ESPP provides for a series of overlapping 24-month offering periods comprising four six-month purchase periods. The\ninitial offering period under the 2022 ESPP is longer than 24 months, commencing November 1, 2022 and ending on November 29, 2024. The purchase price for\nshares of common stock purchased under the ESPP is equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on (i) the first trading day\nof the applicable offering period or (ii) the last trading day of each six month purchase period in the applicable offering period.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to rights granted under the ESPP equals 3,053,749\nshares of our common stock. In addition, on the first day of each calendar year beginning on January 1, 2023 and ending on (and including) January 1, 2032, the\nnumber of shares available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased by a number of shares equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of the fully diluted shares outstanding\non the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year, and (ii) such smaller number of shares as determined by our board of directors.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $0.1 million of unrecognized share-based compensation expense associated with the ESPP, which is expected to be\nrecognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 0.51 years.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were 340,829 shares issued pursuant to the ESPP.\n26\n11. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rate may vary from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the change in the mix of earnings in various state jurisdictions with\ndifferent statutory rates, benefits related to tax credits, and the tax impact of non-deductible expenses, stock award activities and other permanent differences\nbetween income before income taxes and taxable income. The Company’s effective tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\n14.2% and 12.9%, respectively. The variance from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\nprimarily due to the benefit related to tax credits, the tax impact of stock award activities, and the valuation allowance established on federal and state attributes.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 17.4% and 17.5%, respectively. The variance from the U.S. federal\nstatutory tax rate of 21.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the benefit related to tax credits, the tax impact of stock\naward activities, and the valuation allowance established on state attributes.\nThe Company considered the realizability of the deferred tax assets and recorded a valuation allowance as necessary for the amount of deferred tax assets\nwhich are not more likely than not to be realized as of September 30, 2024.\n12. Net Loss Per Share\nLoss Per Share\nBasic loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share\nis computed based on the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. As described in\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Earnout Shares issued in connection with the Business Combination, as further described in Note 3 –\nBusiness Combination, are subject to vesting based on the VWAP of common shares during the earnout period. The Earnout Shares are excluded from the\ncalculation of basic and diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding until vested.\nThe following table outlines the basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (16,373) $ (15,738) $ (48,965) $ (36,566)\nWeighted-average shares outstanding, basic and diluted 102,393 99,905 101,538 99,521\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.16) $ (0.16) $ (0.48) $ (0.37)\nThe following table outlines dilutive common share equivalents outstanding, which are excluded in the above diluted net loss per share calculation, as the effect\nof their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, or the share equivalents were contingently issuable as of each period presented:\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nOptions to purchase common stock issued and outstanding(1) 22,132,077 21,076,042\nEarnout shares 16,292,542 16,292,542\nAvista private placement warrants 8,233,333 8,233,333\nAvista public warrants 7,666,667 7,666,667\nRestricted stock units issued and outstanding(1) 2,165,251 2,338,820\nForward purchase warrants 1,666,667 1,666,667\nBackstop warrants 1,445,489 1,445,489\nShares expected to be purchased under employee stock purchase plan 687,882 1,433,978\nTotal anti-dilutive shares 60,289,908 60,153,538\n_____________\n(1) Outstanding stock options and restricted stock units include awards outstanding to employees of Ligand.\n27\nItem 2.

We\nprovide our partners both integrated end-to-end capabilities and highly customizable offerings, which address critical industry challenges and provide optimized\ndiscovery solutions.\n28\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 86 active partners with 352 active programs using the OmniAb technology platform, including 29 OmniAb-derived\nantibodies in clinical development by our partners, one under regulatory review, and three approved products of our partners.\nOur proprietary technologies are joined with and leverage a suite of in silico, artificial intelligence and machine learning tools for therapeutic discovery and\noptimization that are woven throughout our various technologies and capabilities. Additionally, an established core competency focused on ion channels and\ntransporters further differentiates OmniAb’s technology and creates opportunities in many important and emerging target classes. OmniAb technologies are\ndesigned to be leveraged for the discovery of a variety of next-generation antibody-based therapeutic modalities, including bi- and multi-specific biologics,\nantibody-drug conjugates, CAR-T therapies, targeted radiotherapeutics, and many others.\nThe OmniAb suite of technologies spans from Biological Intelligence-powered repertoire generation to cutting-edge antibody discovery and optimization\noffering an increasingly efficient and customizable end-to-end solution for the growing discovery needs of the global pharmaceutical industry.\nWe partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and leading academic institutions that vary in size, clinical stage, geography and therapeutic\nfocus. Our partners gain access to wide repertoires of antibodies and state-of-the-art screening technologies designed to enable efficient discovery of next-\ngeneration novel therapeutics and deliver high-quality therapeutic antibody candidates for a wide range of diseases. Our partners can select a biological target to\ntreat a disease and define the antibody properties needed for therapeutic development or use certain of our technologies directly in their own laboratories.\nOur license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners generally include: (i) upfront or, in some instances, annual payments for technology\naccess and payments for performance of research services; (ii) downstream payments in the form of preclinical, intellectual property, clinical, regulatory, and\ncommercial milestones; and (iii) royalties on net sales of our partners’ products, if any. License agreements with academic institutions are typically structured with\nrevenue sharing. We succeed when our partners are successful, and our agreements are structured to align economic and scientific interests. Our license agreements\ntypically include reporting requirements, which provide us updates from our partners on the status of their programs. In addition, we track our active partnered\nprograms by reviewing our partners’ public announcements and maintaining close communications with our partners to the extent possible. In some instances, a\npartner may not publicly announce milestones, in which case, we would be generally dependent on our partner to track, report and disclose to us milestones at the\ntime of achievement. Our license agreements typically grant a perpetual license to our technology and are typically terminable by our partners without penalty with\nspecified notice. However, all milestone payments and royalties survive termination and continue with respect to any OmniAb-derived antibodies. The royalty term\nis generally the longer of 10 years from the first commercial sale or through the last expiration in any jurisdiction of the patents covering such OmniAb-derived\nantibody. Importantly, our royalty term is typically linked to the composition-of-matter patents that our partners file related to the antibody discovered using our\ntechnology, which both lengthens and diversifies the royalty streams we receive. Our typical royalty rates for antibody discovery contracts are currently in the low-\nto mid-single digits and can vary depending on other economic terms in the agreement. Although our license agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology\npartners typically include technology access fees, milestone payments and royalties, each agreement is negotiated separately and as a result, the financial terms and\ncontractual provisions vary from agreement to agreement. By providing a full suite of antibody discovery technologies with streamlined economics, we believe we\noffer an attractive option to industry stakeholders.\nWe believe the long-term value of our business will be driven by royalties given that such payments are based on global sales of potential future partner\nprograms, which generally provide for larger and recurring payments as compared to technology access, research and milestone payments. We believe our revenue\nwill be materially driven by milestones in the shorter term, and by royalties in the longer term, from our partnered programs. However, there is significant\nuncertainty in timing and likelihood of reaching marketing authorization in drug discovery and development, and we cannot be certain when, if at all, royalty\npayments will be a material portion of our revenue. Furthermore, we do not control the progression, clinical development, regulatory strategy or eventual\ncommercialization of programs discovered using our platform, and as a result, we are dependent on our partners’ efforts and decisions with respect to such\nprograms.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review the following key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate\nfinancial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe that the following metrics are important to understanding our current business. These metrics are\nhighly dependent on information provided by our partners and may change or may be substituted for additional or different metrics as our business continues to\ngrow.\n29\nActive Clinical Programs\nMetric Active Partners Active Programs and Approved Products Approved Products\nDecember 31, 2023 77 325 32 3\nAdditions 10 39 3 —\nTerminations (1) (12) (2) —\nSeptember 30, 2024 86 352 33 3\nActive partners represents the number of partners that have rights to an active program or have executed a license agreement in advance of initiating an active\nprogram. A partner is removed from the metric when the partner informs us they are terminating their license or they are no longer in business. We view this metric\nas an indication of the competitiveness of our platform and our current level of market penetration. The metric also relates to our opportunities to secure additional\nactive programs.\nActive programs represents a program for which research work has commenced or where an antigen is introduced into our animals and remains so as long as\nthe program is actively being developed or commercialized. This number includes active clinical programs and approved products separately disclosed in the table\nabove. We view this metric as an indication of the usage of our technology and the potential for mid- and long-term milestone and royalty payments.\nActive clinical programs and approved products represents the number of unique programs for which an Investigational New Drug Application or equivalent\nunder other regulatory regimes has been filed based on an OmniAb-derived antibody and which are in clinical development by our partners. We continue to count\nprograms as active as long as they are actively being developed, under regulatory review or commercialized. Where the date of such application is not known to us,\nwe use the official start date from clinical trial registries for the purpose of calculating this metric. This number includes approved products separately disclosed in\nthe table above. We view this metric as an indication of our near- and mid-term potential revenue from milestone fees and potential royalty payments in the long\nterm.\nApproved products represents an OmniAb-derived antibody for which our partner has received marketing approval. We view this metric as an indication of our\nnear- and mid-term potential revenue from royalty payments.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change % Change\nLicense and milestone revenue $ 1,375 $ 2,010 $ (635) (32)%\nService revenue 2,479 3,016 (537) (18)%\nRoyalty revenue 318 451 (133) (29)%\nTotal revenue $ 4,172 $ 5,477 $ (1,305) (24)%\n• License and milestone revenue fluctuates primarily due to the timing of upfront license payments and milestone recognition related to our partners’\nprograms in clinical development.

The tax rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year.\nOur effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0% due to share-based\ncompensation expense that is not tax deductible and an increase to our valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets, partially offset by the tax benefit\nfrom research and development tax credits. Our effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the federal statutory tax\nrate of 21.0% due to share-based compensation expense that is not tax deductible and increases to our valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets,\npartially offset by the tax benefit of research and development tax credits.\n32\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nPrior to our spin-off from Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (“Ligand”) in November 2022, funding from Ligand was our primary source of liquidity. We\nwere capitalized with $95.8 million in net cash in connection with the closing of the business combination pursuant to which OmniAb Operations, Inc., a then\nwholly-owned subsidiary of Ligand (“OmniAb Operations”), was spun off and merged with Orwell Merger Sub Inc., our then wholly-owned subsidiary, with\nOmniAb Operations surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $59.4 million. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term\ninvestments are sufficient to support our operations through at least the next 12 months.\nIf our anticipated cash flows from operations and current cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements because of increased expenditures or lower\ndemand for our technology platform, or the realization of other risks, we may be required to raise additional capital through issuances of public or private equity or\ndebt financing or other capital sources. Such additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In any event, we may consider raising\nadditional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments or acquisitions, to take advantage of favorable market conditions or financing\nopportunities or for other reasons. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n• our ability to achieve revenue growth;\n• the costs of expanding our operations, including our business development and marketing efforts;\n• our rate of progress in selling access to our platform and marketing activities associated therewith;\n• our rate of progress in, and cost of research and development activities associated with, our platform technologies and our internal developed programs to\nthe extent we pursue any such programs;\n• the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n• the impact of pandemic or epidemic diseases on global social, political and economic conditions;\n• our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company;\n• the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights; and\n• the costs associated with any technologies that we may in-license or acquire.\nIn December 2023, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the “Sales Agreement”), with Jefferies LLC (the “Sales Agent”) under which we may,\nfrom time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100.0 million in an “at the market” (“ATM”) offerings program\nthrough the Sales Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the\nSales Agent. The Sales Agent will receive a commission from us of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sales\nAgreement. Sales of our common stock made pursuant to the Sales Agreement are made under our shelf registration statement on Form S‐3 which was filed on\nDecember 8, 2023 and declared effective by the SEC on December 18, 2023. We are not obligated to sell, and the Sales Agent is not obligated to buy or sell, any\nshares of common stock under the Sales Agreement.\nWe anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be primarily to fund our operations, working capital needs, capital expenditures and other general\ncorporate purposes.\nAdditionally, we may receive up to $218.6 million from the exercise of our warrants, assuming the exercise in full of all the warrants for cash, but not from the\nsale of the shares of our common stock issuable upon such exercise. As of the date of this report, our warrants are “out of the money,” which means that the trading\nprice of the shares of our common stock underlying our warrants is below the $11.50 exercise price of the warrants. For so long as the warrants remain out of the\nmoney, we do not expect warrant holders to exercise their warrants. Therefore, any cash proceeds that we may receive in relation to the exercise of such securities\nwill be dependent on the trading price of our common stock.\nCash Flow Summary\n33\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (35,792) $ 11,468 $ (47,260)\nInvesting activities 37,499 (23,106) 60,605\nFinancing activities $ 9,171 $ (396) $ 9,567\nCash from Operating Activities:\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities of $35.8 million primarily reflected our net loss of $49.0 million, changes\nin our operating assets and liabilities in the amount of $8.8 million, partially offset by net non-cash charges of $22.0 million which primarily included $16.4 million\nin share-based compensation and $16.0 million in depreciation and amortization.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by operating activities of $11.5 million primarily reflected changes in our operating assets\nand liabilities in the amount of $24.9 million, net non-cash charges of $23.2 million which primarily included $18.9 million in share-based compensation, and\n$14.6 million in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by our net loss of $36.6 million.\nCash from Investing Activities:\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities of $37.5 million primarily consisted of $63.5 million of proceeds from\nthe maturity of short-term investments and $1.9 million from the sale of short-term investments, partially offset by $25.7 million of cash used to purchase short-\nterm investments and $1.8 million of cash used to purchase property and equipment.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities of $23.1 million primarily consisted of $86.9 million of cash used to\npurchase short-term investments and $3.6 million of payments to contingent liabilities holders, partially offset by $66.3 million of proceeds from the maturity of\nshort-term investments.\nCash from Financing Activities:\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $9.2 million, which primarily consisted of $8.5 million of\nproceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ATM facility, net of commissions and $2.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from\nstock plans, partially offset by $1.0 million of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards and $0.5 million of transaction costs.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was $0.4 million, which primarily consisted of $0.9 million of taxes paid\nrelated to the net share settlement of equity awards and $0.5 million of transaction costs, partially offset by $1.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of common\nstock from stock plans.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the\ncritical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the\n2023 Annual Report.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor the summary of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements included in this\nQuarterly Report.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our market risks from the discussion provided in Item 7A of our 2023 Annual Report.\n34\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we\nfile with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In\nreaching a reasonable level of assurance, management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and\nprocedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no\nassurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control\nsystem, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this\nQuarterly Report. Based upon such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n35\nPart II – Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFor information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our 2023 Annual Report, refer to Note 8 – Commitments and\nContingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1, of this report.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually\nor in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, regardless of outcome, litigation can have an\nadverse impact on our business because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that\nfavorable outcomes will be obtained.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nWe do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report. The risk factors\ndescribed in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Factors we currently do not know, factors that we currently consider immaterial or factors that\nare not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also materially adversely affect our business or our consolidated operating results, financial\ncondition or cash flows.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nNone.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nFrom time to time, our officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) and directors may enter into Rule 10b5-1 or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangements (as each such term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K). During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers or directors\nadopted, modified, or terminated any such trading arrangements.\n36\nItem 6.

(NASDAQ: OABI)** today reported financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and provided operating and partner program updates. \n\n“We are pleased to report another successful quarter demonstrating our continued commitment to innovation with the expansion of our technology platform and a growing partnership portfolio. Third quarter results reflect consistent growth across key metrics, driven by our planned initiatives and the dedication of our team,” said Matt Foehr, Chief Executive Officer of OmniAb. “Our business is well capitalized, and we have a highly scalable model with cutting-edge technologies that are driving significant opportunities. As we move forward, we remain focused on delivering value to our stakeholders and creating sustainable, profitable growth.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.2 million, compared with $5.5 million for the same period in 2023, with the decrease primarily due to timing of milestones and lower ion channel service revenue. \n\nResearch and development expense was $13.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $13.9 million for the same period in 2023, with the decrease primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense. General and administrative expense was $7.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with $8.5 million for the same period in 2023, with the decrease primarily due to lower legal and share-based compensation expense. \n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $16.4 million, or $0.16 per share, compared with a net loss of $15.7 million, or $0.16 per share, for the same period in 2023. \n\n**Year-to-Date Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $15.6 million, compared with $29.3 million for the same period in 2023, due to lower milestone revenue primarily related to a $10 million milestone in the prior year period for the first commercial sale of TECVAYLI ® (teclistamab) in the European Union. \n\nResearch and development expense was $41.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was unchanged from the same period in 2023. General and administrative expense was $23.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $25.4 million for the same period in 2023, with the decrease primarily due to lower outside service expenses. Amortization of intangible assets increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a $1.2 million impairment related to assets associated with two legacy unpartnered Ab Initio programs. Other operating income, net increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a $2.4 million reduction in contingent liabilities attributed to changes in ion channel programs. \n\nNet loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $49.0 million, or $0.48 per share, compared with a net loss of $36.6 million, or $0.37 per share, for the same period in 2023. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, OmniAb had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $59.4 million. \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, OmniAb sold 2.0 million shares of common stock through its at-the-market (ATM) program pursuant to the sales agreement with Jefferies. The net proceeds from these sales were $8.5 million. \n\nSubsequent to the end of the third quarter, OmniAb sold 0.7 million shares of common stock through its ATM program for net proceeds of $2.9 million, which will be reflected in its December 31, 2024 financial statements. \n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nOmniAb continues to expect total operating expenses in 2024 to be slightly less than total operating expenses in 2023. \n\nOmniAb now expects to end 2024 with a cash balance in the range of $50 million to $60 million, which includes proceeds from its ATM program. Given the current expected progression of the existing partnered pipeline, OmniAb expects cash use in 2025 to be lower than in 2024 excluding recent ATM program proceeds. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, OmniAb entered into three new platform license agreements including with 92Bio, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Queen Mary University of London. In addition, OmniAb recently expanded its ion channel screening relationship with Syngenta that was initially established last year. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 86 active partners and 352 active programs, including 33 OmniAb-derived programs in clinical development or being commercialized. OmniAb also recently entered into a new platform license agreement with Incyte Corporation. \n\nThird quarter 2024 and recent partner and business highlights include the following: \n\nIMVT-1402\n\n  * Immunovant announced that the Investigational New Drug (IND) application has been cleared for IMVT-1402 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with a potential best-in-class profile in difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA. \n  * Immunovant announced that five IND applications for IMVT-1402 have been cleared across a range of therapeutic areas and U.S. Food & Drug Administration divisions. The company also announced that it is on track to initiate potentially registrational trials with IMVT-1402 in four to five indications, including Graves’ disease (GD) and D2T RA, by March 31, 2025. \n\n\n\nBatoclimab\n\n  * Immunovant reported positive results from the Phase 2a trial of batoclimab in GD. High-dose batoclimab achieved a 76% response rate and a 56% antithyroid drugs (ATD)-free response rate in patients uncontrolled on ATDs at week 12. \n  * Immunovant announced that batoclimab trials in myasthenia gravis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy are fully enrolled to support data disclosures by March 31, 2025. Data from batoclimab trials in thyroid eye disease are now expected in the second half of calendar year 2025. All batoclimab data will inform future trials with IMVT-1402. \n\n\n\nAcasunlimab\n\n  * Genmab announced that based on encouraging data from the Phase 2 trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a Phase 3 trial is expected to start before the end date of 2024. \n\n\n\nTEV-53408\n\n  * Teva recently disclosed Phase 1 data for TEV-53408 showing a potential best-in-class profile noting high affinity for IL-15, prolonged suppression of free IL-15, and potential for a low dosing frequency. TEV-53408 was well tolerated in a first-in-human study, and a proof-of-concept study in celiac disease is in progress. Additionally, Teva disclosed the initiation of a clinical study in vitiligo, an autoimmune disease. \n\n\n\nSugemalimab\n\n  * CStone announced that the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved sugemalimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for adult patients with metastatic NSCLC without EGFR-sensitive mutations or ALK, ROS1, RET genomic alterations. \n  * CStone announced long-term survival data for sugemalimab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment of stage IV NSCLC at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2024. Four-year follow-up data showed that sugemalimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy continues to demonstrate a significant benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival compared with placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy. The four-year survival rate was 32.1% versus 17.3%. \n\n\n\nBC3195\n\n  * BioCity presented interim clinical results on the safety and efficacy of its first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate BC3195, which targets CDH3 (P-Cadherin), in a Phase 1 clinical trial at ESMO 2024. \n  * As of the data cut-off date (August 10, 2024), BC3195 demonstrated impressive antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC with an overall response rate (ORR) of 36.4% (4 of 11 patients). The ORR was 80% (4 of 5 patients) in NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. BC3195 demonstrated manageable safety and tolerability, as well as favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics. \n  * BC3195 is currently undergoing concurrent Phase 1 dose-optimization and dose-expansion studies in China. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nOmniAb management will host a conference call with accompanying slides today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss this announcement and answer questions.
