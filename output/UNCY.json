(Nasdaq: UNCY) (the “Company” or “Unicycive”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapies for patients with kidney disease, today announced its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“We are pleased with the tremendous progress we have made over the last several months highlighted by the acceptance of our New Drug Application for oxylanthanum carbonate (OLC) which may result in the potential approval of our first drug in 2025,” said Shalabh Gupta, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Unicycive. “If approved, we believe OLC’s high potency and low pill burden would provide a best-in-class option for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis who have hyperphosphatemia and face adherence challenges with current treatment regimens. With the NDA acceptance now behind us, we are actively preparing to commercialize OLC with the goal of bringing this innovative new treatment to market in the second half of 2025.”\n\n“We have also made progress on our second asset, UNI-494, as we announced the successful completion of our Phase 1 clinical trial providing the necessary data to potentially advance to Phase 2 clinical development. UNI-494 is targeting acute kidney injury (AKI), a challenging and often under-treated disease. We plan to request a meeting with the FDA by the end of this year to continue advancing our clinical development program for UNI-494,” concluded Dr. Gupta.\n\n**Key Highlights**\n\n  * Announced the acceptance of the New Drug Application (NDA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for OLC for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD on dialysis. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) Target Action Date of June 28, 2025.\n  * Announced initial results from the patient reported outcome survey conducted during the UNI-OLC-201 pivotal clinical trial. In the survey, OLC consistently outperformed the other phosphate binders in all categories: 79% of patients preferred OLC compared to 18% of patients who preferred their prior therapy; 98% of patients said that OLC was easy to take compared to 55% for their prior therapy; and 89% of patients said they were satisfied with OLC while only 49% were satisfied with their prior therapy.\n  * Announced the successful completion of the UNI-494 Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 study was a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized single ascending dose (Part 1) and multiple ascending dose (Part 2) study in healthy volunteers conducted in the United Kingdom. UNI-494 was well-tolerated as a single dose up to 160 mg and in multiple doses at 40 mg twice-a-day. The absorption of UNI-494 was fast, and UNI-494 was rapidly metabolized to release nicorandil. Collectively, the results will help determine the dose and schedule of UNI-494 in a potential Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with acute kidney injury.\n  * Granted a patent on UNI-494 to treat AKI by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent, valid until 2040, secures protection of a method of treating a disease or a condition (“method of use”) related to AKI or contrast-induced-nephropathy by administering the UNI-494 compound.\n  * Delivered four presentations on OLC and UNI-494 at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2024 including a late-breaker poster presentation highlighting favorable safety and tolerability data of OLC. The presentation highlighted the positive pivotal clinical trial data demonstrating that OLC was able to achieve serum phosphate control in more than 90% of patients with CKD on dialysis who entered the maintenance phase of the trial. A poster presentation also described the results from the UNI-494 Phase 1 study results, and two preclinical posters were presented.\n  * Two preclinical studies for both OLC and UNI-494 were featured in two publications: “Systemic Absorption of Oxylanthanum Carbonate is Minimal in Preclinical Models” was published in the _Pharmaceutical Chemistry Journal;_ “Evaluation of UNI-494 in Acute Kidney Injury Treatment Efficacy When Administered After Ischemia-Reperfusion in a Rat Model” was published in _EC Pharmacology and Toxicology_.\n  * UNCY was added to the Russell Microcap® Index effective July 1, 2024. Membership in the Russell Microcap® Index, which remains in place for one year is accompanied by automatic inclusion in the appropriate growth and value style indexes. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nResearch and Development (R&D) expenses were $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to decreased drug development costs.\n\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) expenses were $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased non-cash stock compensation expense.\n\nOther Income was $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a decrease in the fair value of our warrant liability.\n\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.1 million, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $4.4 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreased net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our warrant liability.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $32.3 million. The Company believes that it has sufficient resources to fund planned operations into 2026.\n\n**About Unicycive Therapeutics**\n\nUnicycive Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing novel treatments for kidney diseases.

If approved, OLC has the potential to meaningfully improve the treatment burden for hyperphosphatemia patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.\n\n“We are thrilled with the FDA acceptance of our first NDA, a significant milestone towards our efforts to bring this important treatment option to patients with kidney disease if approved,” said Shalabh Gupta, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Unicycive. “CKD patients on dialysis with hyperphosphatemia are often saddled with an onerous treatment regimen that includes having to take as many as 12 pills per day. OLC may have meaningful patient adherence benefits over currently available treatment options as it requires a lower pill burden for patients in terms of the number and size of pills per dose, and the pills are swallowed instead of chewed for added convenience. With our NDA now under review, we are preparing to commercialize and launch OLC in the second half of 2025, if approved.”\n\nUnicycive is seeking FDA approval of OLC via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. The NDA submission package is based on data from three clinical studies (a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, a bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers, and a tolerability study of OLC in CKD patients on dialysis), multiple preclinical studies, and the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) data. OLC is protected by a strong global patent portfolio including issued patents on composition of matter with exclusivity until 2031, and with the potential for patent term extension until 2035.\n\nAs previously announced, the FDA granted a waiver for the NDA application PDUFA fees, representing a significant savings of approximately $4 million for Unicycive.\n\n**About Oxylanthanum Carbonate (OLC)**\n\nOxylanthanum carbonate is a next-generation lanthanum-based phosphate binding agent utilizing proprietary nanoparticle technology being developed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. OLC has over thirty issued and granted patents globally. Its potential best-in-class profile may have meaningful patient adherence benefits over currently available treatment options as it requires a lower pill burden for patients in terms of number and size of pills per dose that are swallowed instead of chewed. Based on a survey conducted in 2022, Nephrologists stated that the greatest unmet need in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia with phosphate binders is a lower pill burden and better patient compliance.1 The global market opportunity for treating hyperphosphatemia is expected to exceed $2.5 billion, with the United States accounting for more than $1 billion of that total2. Despite the availability of several FDA-cleared medications, 75 percent of U.S. dialysis patients fail to achieve the target phosphorus levels recommended by published medical guidelines.\n\n1Reason Research, LLC 2022 survey.

If left untreated, hyperphosphatemia leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which then results in renal osteodystrophy (a condition similar to osteoporosis and associated with significant bone disease, fractures and bone pain); cardiovascular disease with associated hardening of arteries and atherosclerosis (due to deposition of excess calcium-phosphorus complexes in soft tissue). Importantly, hyperphosphatemia is independently associated with increased mortality for patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. Based on available clinical data to date, over 80% of patients show signs of cardiovascular calcification by the time they become dependent on dialysis.\n\nDialysis patients are already at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (because of underlying diseases such as diabetes and hypertension), and hyperphosphatemia further exacerbates this. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia is aimed at lowering serum phosphate levels via two means: (1) restricting dietary phosphorus intake; and (2) using, on a daily basis, and with each meal, oral phosphate binding drugs that facilitate fecal elimination of dietary phosphate rather than its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream.\n\n**About Unicycive Therapeutics**\n\nUnicycive Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing novel treatments for kidney diseases. Unicycive’s lead drug candidate, oxylanthanum carbonate (OLC), is a novel investigational phosphate binding agent being developed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis. UNI-494 is a patent-protected new chemical entity in clinical development for the treatment of conditions related to acute kidney injury.

(Nasdaq: UNCY) (the “Company” or “Unicycive”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapies for patients with kidney disease, today announced its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and provided a business update.\n\n“We are pleased with the tremendous progress we have made over the last several months highlighted by the acceptance of our New Drug Application for oxylanthanum carbonate (OLC) which may result in the potential approval of our first drug in 2025,” said Shalabh Gupta, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Unicycive. “If approved, we believe OLC’s high potency and low pill burden would provide a best-in-class option for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis who have hyperphosphatemia and face adherence challenges with current treatment regimens. With the NDA acceptance now behind us, we are actively preparing to commercialize OLC with the goal of bringing this innovative new treatment to market in the second half of 2025.”\n\n“We have also made progress on our second asset, UNI-494, as we announced the successful completion of our Phase 1 clinical trial providing the necessary data to potentially advance to Phase 2 clinical development. UNI-494 is targeting acute kidney injury (AKI), a challenging and often under-treated disease. We plan to request a meeting with the FDA by the end of this year to continue advancing our clinical development program for UNI-494,” concluded Dr. Gupta.\n\n**Key Highlights**\n\n  * Announced the acceptance of the New Drug Application (NDA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for OLC for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD on dialysis. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) Target Action Date of June 28, 2025.\n  * Announced initial results from the patient reported outcome survey conducted during the UNI-OLC-201 pivotal clinical trial. In the survey, OLC consistently outperformed the other phosphate binders in all categories: 79% of patients preferred OLC compared to 18% of patients who preferred their prior therapy; 98% of patients said that OLC was easy to take compared to 55% for their prior therapy; and 89% of patients said they were satisfied with OLC while only 49% were satisfied with their prior therapy.\n  * Announced the successful completion of the UNI-494 Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 study was a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized single ascending dose (Part 1) and multiple ascending dose (Part 2) study in healthy volunteers conducted in the United Kingdom. UNI-494 was well-tolerated as a single dose up to 160 mg and in multiple doses at 40 mg twice-a-day. The absorption of UNI-494 was fast, and UNI-494 was rapidly metabolized to release nicorandil. Collectively, the results will help determine the dose and schedule of UNI-494 in a potential Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with acute kidney injury.\n  * Granted a patent on UNI-494 to treat AKI by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent, valid until 2040, secures protection of a method of treating a disease or a condition (“method of use”) related to AKI or contrast-induced-nephropathy by administering the UNI-494 compound.\n  * Delivered four presentations on OLC and UNI-494 at the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Kidney Week 2024 including a late-breaker poster presentation highlighting favorable safety and tolerability data of OLC. The presentation highlighted the positive pivotal clinical trial data demonstrating that OLC was able to achieve serum phosphate control in more than 90% of patients with CKD on dialysis who entered the maintenance phase of the trial. A poster presentation also described the results from the UNI-494 Phase 1 study results, and two preclinical posters were presented.\n  * Two preclinical studies for both OLC and UNI-494 were featured in two publications: “Systemic Absorption of Oxylanthanum Carbonate is Minimal in Preclinical Models” was published in the _Pharmaceutical Chemistry Journal;_ “Evaluation of UNI-494 in Acute Kidney Injury Treatment Efficacy When Administered After Ischemia-Reperfusion in a Rat Model” was published in _EC Pharmacology and Toxicology_.\n  * UNCY was added to the Russell Microcap® Index effective July 1, 2024. Membership in the Russell Microcap® Index, which remains in place for one year is accompanied by automatic inclusion in the appropriate growth and value style indexes. \n\n\n\n**Financial Results for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nResearch and Development (R&D) expenses were $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to decreased drug development costs.\n\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) expenses were $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased non-cash stock compensation expense.\n\nOther Income was $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to a decrease in the fair value of our warrant liability.\n\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.1 million, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $4.4 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decreased net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our warrant liability.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $32.3 million. The Company believes that it has sufficient resources to fund planned operations into 2026.\n\n**About Unicycive Therapeutics**\n\nUnicycive Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing novel treatments for kidney diseases.
