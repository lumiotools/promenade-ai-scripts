SEI’s strong EPS growth is attributable to double-digit revenue growth, margin\nexpansion in each segment, a one-time gain of $8.2 million, or $0.05 impact, due to the sale\nof property located in New York, and a large one-time performance fee from LSV, of which\nour portion was approximately $5.3 million, or $0.03 impact.\n• Consolidated revenues increased by 13% from Q3 2023, with each business segment posting\npositive growth. Both the Private Banks and Investment Advisors segments realized double-\ndigit revenue growth in the quarter.\n◦ Drivers of revenue growth were broad-based, with positive contributions from market\nappreciation, cross-sales to existing clients, and sales to new clients.\n◦ Private Banks revenue growth of 16% was driven by backlog implementations,\nconverting new clients onto the SEI Wealth PlatformSM (SWP), and growth in the\nvolume of assets processed on SWP.\n◦ Investment Advisors revenue growth of 15% was driven by a positive contribution from\nthe FDIC program, which contributed $10.7 million to revenue in the quarter, and\nstrong performance in separate account offerings.\n• Average assets under administration increased by 2%, and average assets under management\nincreased by 4%, relative to the second-quarter 2024. On a year-over-year basis, average AUA\nand AUM increased by 15% and 16%, respectively.\n◦ Combined assets under management, administration, and advisement reached a record\nbalance of approximately $1.6 trillion at quarter-end.\n◦ Increases in assets were driven by a mix of market appreciation and positive net\ninflows, notably in the Investment Advisors and Investment Managers segments.\n• Operating profit margins of 26.8% increased on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.\nMargins also increased for each of our business segments, also on a year-over-year and\nsequential basis. Margin improvement was driven by operating leverage on revenue growth in\naddition to focused cost management efforts, most notably in the Private Banks and\nInstitutional Investors businesses.\n• Net sales events during the third quarter 2024 were $46.4 million, a record level of net sales\nevents for any single quarter. Net sales events in third quarter are expected to generate net\nannualized recurring revenues of approximately $34.9 million when contract values are\ncompletely realized (see the Sales Events schedule for further details).\n• Earnings from LSV increased to $36.5 million in the third quarter 2024 as compared to $29.9\nmillion in the third quarter 2023 due to market appreciation and higher performance fees.\nNet negative cash flows from existing clients and client losses partially offset the increase in\nearnings from LSV.\n• SEI repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock for $85.8 million during the third quarter\n2024 at an average price of $67.40 per share.\n• SEI recognized other income of $8.2 million, or $0.05 diluted earnings per share, in third\nquarter 2024 from the sale of property located in New York, NY, noted above.\n3\nEarnings Conference Call\nA conference call to review earnings is scheduled for 5 p.m. Eastern time on Oct. 23, 2024.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nSEI Investments Company (the Company), a Pennsylvania corporation, provides comprehensive platforms, services and\ninfrastructure–encompassing technology, operational, and investment management services–to help wealth managers,\nfinancial advisors, investment managers, family offices, institutional and private investors create and manage wealth.\nInvestment processing platforms provide technologies and business process outsourcing services for wealth managers.\nThese solutions include investment advisory, client relationship, and other technology-enabled capabilities for the front\noffice; administrative and investment services for the middle office; and accounting and processing services for the back\noffice. Revenues from investment processing platforms are recognized in Information processing and software servicing\nfees on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInvestment operations platforms provide business process outsourcing services for investment managers and asset\nowners. These platforms support a broad range of traditional and alternative investments and provide technology-enabled\ninformation analytics and investor capabilities for the front office; administrative and investment services for the middle\noffice; and fund administration and accounting services for the back office. Revenues from investment operations\nplatforms are recognized in Asset management, administration and distribution fees on the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nInvestment management platforms provide comprehensive solutions for managing personal and institutional wealth.\nThese platforms include goals-based investment strategies; SEI-sponsored investment products, including mutual funds,\ncollective investment products, alternative investment portfolios and separately managed accounts (SMA); and other\nmarket-specific advice, technology and operational components. These platforms are offered to wealth managers as part\nof a complete goals-based investment program for their end-investors. For institutional investors, the Company provides\nOutsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) solutions and Enhanced Chief Investment Officer (ECIO) solutions that\ninclude investment management programs, as well as advisory and administrative services. Revenues from investment\nmanagement platforms are recognized in Asset management, administration and distribution fees on the accompanying\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. Certain financial information and accompanying note disclosure\nnormally included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted. The interim financial\ninformation is unaudited but reflects all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the\nopinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024, the\nresults of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and cash flows for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. These interim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThere have been no significant changes in significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company or its affiliates have created numerous investment products for its clients in various types of legal entity\nstructures. The Company serves as the Manager, Administrator and Distributor for these investment products and may\nalso serve as the Trustee for some of the investment products. The Company receives asset management, distribution,\nadministration and custodial fees for these services. Clients are the equity investors and participate in proportion to their\nownership percentage in the net income or loss and net capital gains or losses of the products, and, on liquidation, will\nparticipate in proportion to their ownership percentage in the remaining net assets of the products after satisfaction of\noutstanding liabilities. The Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of the entities and, therefore, is\nnot required to consolidate any of the pooled investment vehicles for which it receives asset management, distribution,\nadministration and custodial fees under the VIE model.\nThe Company is a party to expense limitation agreements with certain SEI-sponsored money market funds subject to Rule\n2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 which establish a maximum level of ordinary operating expenses incurred by\n9\nthe fund in any fiscal year including, but not limited to, fees of the administrator or its affiliates. Under the terms of these\nagreements, the Company waived $1,202 and $5,519 in fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company waived $6,764 and\n$16,400, respectively, in fees.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when the transfer of control of promised goods or services under the terms of a contract with\ncustomers are satisfied in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in\nexchange for those promised goods or services. Certain portions of the Company’s revenues involve a third party in\nproviding goods or services to its customers. In such circumstances, the Company must determine whether the nature of\nits promise to the customer is to provide the underlying goods or services (the Company is the principal in the transaction\nand reports the transaction gross) or to arrange for a third party to provide the underlying goods or services (the entity is\nthe agent in the transaction and reports the transaction net). See Note 13 for related disclosures regarding revenue\nrecognition.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes $423,471 and $397,838 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, invested in SEI-sponsored open-ended money market mutual funds. See Note 5 for information related to the\nCompany's total investments in SEI-sponsored and non-SEI-sponsored money market mutual funds and commercial\npaper classified as cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash includes $250 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 segregated for regulatory purposes related\nto trade-execution services conducted by SEI Investments (Europe) Limited. Restricted cash also includes $52 and $51 at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, segregated in special reserve accounts for the benefit of\ncustomers of the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary, SEI Investments Distribution Co. (SIDCO), in accordance with\ncertain rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for broker-dealers.\nCapitalized Software\nThe Company capitalized $18,414 and $26,584 of software development costs during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to further develop the SEI Wealth PlatformSM (SWP) and for the development\nof a new platform for the Investment Managers segment. The Company capitalized $10,542 and $13,706 of software\ndevelopment costs for significant enhancements to SWP during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. As of September 30, 2024, the net book value of SWP was $208,457. The net book value includes $1,145 of\ncapitalized software development costs in-progress associated with future releases of SWP. SWP has a weighted average\nremaining life of 8.4 years. Amortization expense for SWP was $20,517 and $19,027 during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company also capitalized $7,872 and $12,878 of software development costs during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the development of a new platform for the Investment Managers\nsegment. Capitalized software development costs in-progress associated with this platform were $28,040 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The platform is not yet ready for use.\nEarnings per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 are:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 154,900 $ 115,661 $ 425,420 $ 341,527\nShares used to compute basic earnings per common share 129,418,000 132,231,000 130,550,000 133,035,000\nDilutive effect of stock awards 1,253,000 1,273,000 1,280,000 1,215,000\nShares used to compute diluted earnings per common\nshare 130,671,000 133,504,000 131,830,000 134,250,000\nBasic earnings per common share $ 1.20 $ 0.87 $ 3.26 $ 2.57\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 1.19 $ 0.87 $ 3.23 $ 2.54\nDuring the three months ended Sept 30, 2024 and 2023, employee stock options to purchase 10,606,000 and 10,869,000\nshares of common stock with an average exercise price of $61.06 and $61.31, respectively, were outstanding but not\n10\nincluded in the computation of diluted earnings per common share. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, employee stock options to purchase 10,747,000 and 11,049,000 shares of common stock with an average\nexercise price of $61.05 and $61.29, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted\nearnings per common share. These options for the three and nine month periods were not included in the computation of\ndiluted earnings per common share because either the performance conditions have not been satisfied or would not have\nbeen satisfied if the reporting date was the end of the contingency period or the options' exercise price was greater than\nthe average market price of the Company’s common stock and the effect on diluted earnings per common share would\nhave been anti-dilutive.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07) which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through\nenhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 apply retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial\nstatements. The Company continues to assess the impact of ASU 2023-07. The Company has identified the chief\noperating decision maker (CODM) and is in the process of finalizing the significant segment expenses and other\ninformation regularly provided to the CODM and included with the reported measure of segment profit/loss. The Company\nis on schedule to complete its assessment of ASU 2023-07 and the impact on its consolidated financial statements and\nrelated disclosures as of January 1, 2025.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures\n(ASU 2023-09) to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective\nfor annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company\nis currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n11\nStatements of Cash Flows\nFor purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers investment instruments purchased\nwith an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nThe following table provides the details of the adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating\nactivities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n2024 2023\nNet income $ 425,420 $ 341,527\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation 25,097 26,509\nAmortization 31,284 28,851\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate (102,375) (91,517)\nDistributions received from unconsolidated affiliate 112,476 100,252\nStock-based compensation 37,224 23,458\nProvision for losses on receivables 1,170 283\nDeferred income tax expense (21,051) (20,971)\nNet gain from investments (3,349) (1,053)\nNet gain from sale of property (8,151) —\nChange in other long-term liabilities 3,205 3,105\nChange in other assets (4,005) 1,099\nContract costs capitalized, net of amortization (2,306) (590)\nOther (2,900) 2,122\nChange in current assets and liabilities:\nReceivables from investment products 1,301 6,327\nReceivables (109,522) (62,053)\nOther current assets 606 (8,654)\nAdvances due from unconsolidated affiliate 51,005 51,293\nAccounts payable (2,364) (3,085)\nAccrued liabilities (1,655) (48,128)\nDeferred revenue (4,036) (2,793)\nTotal adjustments 1,654 4,455\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 427,074 $ 345,982\nNote 2. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate\nLSV Asset Management\nThe Company has an investment in LSV Asset Management (LSV), a registered investment advisor that provides\ninvestment advisory services primarily to institutions, including pension plans and investment companies. LSV is currently\nan investment sub-advisor for a limited number of SEI-sponsored investment products. The Company's partnership\ninterest in LSV as of September 30, 2024 was 38.6%. The Company accounts for its interest in LSV using the equity\nmethod because of its less than 50% ownership. The Company’s interest in the net assets of LSV is reflected in\nInvestment in unconsolidated affiliate on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and its interest in the earnings\nof LSV is reflected in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company’s total investment in LSV was $49,675. The Company's investment includes\nadvances provided to LSV related to their working capital accounts. The Company receives partnership distributions from\nLSV on a quarterly basis. The Company received partnership distributions from LSV of $112,476 and $100,252 in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As such, the Company considers these distribution payments\nas returns on investment rather than returns of the Company's original investment in LSV and has therefore classified the\nassociated cash inflows as an operating activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n12\nThe Company’s proportionate share in the earnings of LSV was $36,513 and $29,927 during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the\nCompany’s proportionate share in the earnings of LSV was $102,375 and $91,517, respectively.\nThese tables contain condensed financial information of LSV:\nCondensed Statement of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ 122,412 $ 102,183 $ 343,581 $ 309,211\nNet income 94,634 77,566 265,335 237,119\nCondensed Balance Sheets September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCurrent assets $ 137,776 $ 169,867\nNon-current assets 5,735 6,568\nTotal assets $ 143,511 $ 176,435\nCurrent liabilities $ 66,795 $ 74,853\nNon-current liabilities 5,544 2,182\nPartners’ capital 71,172 99,400\nTotal liabilities and partners’ capital $ 143,511 $ 176,435\nNote 3.

These billing schedules generally provide for\nfees to be billed on a quarterly basis. In addition, certain fees earned from investment operations services are calculated\nbased on assets under administration that have an extended valuation process. Billings to these clients occur once the\nasset valuation processes are completed.\nReceivables from investment products on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily represent fees\nreceivable for distribution, investment advisory, and administration services to various regulated investment companies\nand other investment products sponsored by SEI.\n13\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and Equipment on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets consists of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBuildings $ 216,418 $ 216,968\nEquipment 194,591 193,096\nLand 27,317 26,450\nPurchased software 165,676 165,348\nFurniture and fixtures 23,028 23,025\nLeasehold improvements 26,533 19,827\nConstruction in progress 507 684\n654,070 645,398\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n(489,143) (474,034)\nProperty and Equipment, net $ 164,927 $ 171,364\nThe Company recognized $25,097 and $26,509 in depreciation expense related to property and equipment for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs, which primarily consist of deferred sales commissions, were $42,527 and $40,221 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company deferred expenses related to contract costs of\n$5,326 and $2,243 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company deferred expenses related to contract costs of $10,237 and $7,212,\nrespectively. Amortization expense related to deferred contract costs were $7,931 and $6,622 during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense related to deferred contract costs is included in\nCompensation, benefits and other personnel on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were\nno material impairment losses in relation to deferred contract costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAccrued Liabilities\nAccrued liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccrued employee compensation $ 103,977 $ 107,495\nAccrued employee benefits and other personnel 10,368 9,797\nAccrued voluntary separation program 5,515 21,058\nAccrued consulting, outsourcing and professional fees 37,753 32,285\nAccrued sub-advisory, distribution and other asset management fees 51,812 49,405\nAccrued dividend payable 1,042 61,104\nAccrued income taxes 13,130 4,965\nOther accrued liabilities 34,570 32,836\nTotal accrued liabilities $ 258,167 $ 318,945\nNote 4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, except for the Company's investment funds sponsored by\nLSV, is determined in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company’s Level 1 financial assets\nconsist mainly of investments in open-ended mutual funds that are quoted daily. Level 2 financial assets consist of GNMA\nmortgage-backed securities held by the Company's wholly-owned limited purpose federal thrift subsidiary, SEI Private\nTrust Company (SPTC), and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and other U.S. government agency short-term notes held\nby SIDCO. The financial assets held by SIDCO were purchased as part of a cash management program requiring only\nshort term, top-tier investment grade government and corporate securities. The financial assets held by SPTC are debt\nsecurities issued by GNMA and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. These securities were\npurchased for the sole purpose of satisfying applicable regulatory requirements and have maturity dates which range from\n2027 to 2041.\n14\nThe fair value of the Company's investment funds sponsored by LSV is measured using the net asset value per share\n(NAV) as a practical expedient. The NAVs of the funds are calculated by the funds' independent custodian and are derived\nfrom the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date. The funds allow for investor redemptions at the\nend of each calendar month. This investment has not been classified in the fair value hierarchy but is presented in the\ntables below to permit reconciliation to the amounts presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe valuation of the Company's Level 2 financial assets held by SIDCO and SPTC are based upon securities pricing\npolicies and procedures utilized by third-party pricing vendors.\nThe pricing policies and procedures applied for our Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 were consistent with those as described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K at\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company had no Level 3 financial assets at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023 that\nwere required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company's Level 3 financial liabilities at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consist entirely of the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration\nresulting from an acquisition (See Note 12). There were no transfers of financial assets between levels within the fair\nvalue hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe fair value of certain financial assets of the Company was determined using the following inputs:\nFair Value Measurements at the End of the\nReporting Period Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets Other\nfor Identical Observable\nAssets Inputs\nAssets September 30, 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2)\nEquity securities $ 40,251 $ 40,251 $ —\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities 135,471 — 135,471\nFixed-income securities owned 30,289 — 30,289\nInvestment funds sponsored by LSV (1) 8,410\n$ 214,421 $ 40,251 $ 165,760\nFair Value Measurements at the End of the\nReporting Period Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets Other\nfor Identical Observable\nAssets Inputs\nAssets December 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2)\nEquity securities $ 36,661 $ 36,661 $ —\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities 118,752 — 118,752\nFixed-income securities owned 31,334 — 31,334\nInvestment funds sponsored by LSV (1) 7,316\n$ 194,063 $ 36,661 $ 150,086\n(1) The fair value amounts presented in the tables above are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to\nthe amounts presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (See Note 5).\nNote 5. Marketable Securities\nMarketable securities include investments in money market funds and commercial paper classified as cash equivalents,\navailable-for-sale debt securities, investments in SEI-sponsored and non-SEI-sponsored mutual funds, equities,\ninvestments in funds sponsored by LSV and securities owned by SIDCO.\nCash Equivalents\nInvestments in SEI-sponsored and non-SEI-sponsored money market funds and commercial paper classified as cash\nequivalents had a fair value of $633,780 and $565,588 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThere were no material unrealized or realized gains or losses from these investments during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. Investments in money market funds and commercial paper are Level 1 assets.\n15\nAvailable for Sale and Equity Securities\nAvailable For Sale and Equity Securities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:\nAt September 30, 2024\nGross Gross\nCost Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nAmount Gains (Losses) Value\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities $ 142,718 $ — $ (7,247) $ 135,471\nSEI-sponsored mutual funds 32,203 2,144 — 34,347\nEquities and other mutual funds 5,418 486 — 5,904\n$ 180,339 $ 2,630 $ (7,247) $ 175,722\nAt December 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nCost Unrealized Unrealized Fair\nAmount Gains (Losses) Value\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities $ 127,681 $ — $ (8,929) $ 118,752\nSEI-sponsored mutual funds 30,427 818 (19) 31,226\nEquities and other mutual funds 5,301 134 — 5,435\n$ 163,409 $ 952 $ (8,948) $ 155,413\nNet unrealized losses at September 30, 2024 of available-for-sale debt securities were $5,580 (net of income tax benefit\nof $1,667). Net unrealized losses at December 31, 2023 of available-for-sale debt securities were $6,875 (net of income\ntax benefit of $2,054). These unrealized losses are associated with the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed\nsecurities issued by GNMA and were caused by interest rate increases (See Note 4). The contractual cash flows of these\nsecurities are guaranteed by an agency of the U.S. government. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not\nbe settled at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the Company's investments. The Company does not intend to\nsell the investments and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their\namortized cost bases. These net unrealized losses are reported as a separate component of Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following tables provide the scheduled maturities of the Company's available-for-sale debt securities:\nAt September 30, 2024\nCost Fair Value\nWithin one year $ — $ —\nAfter one year through five years 4,648 4,269\nAfter 5 years through 10 years 17,732 16,478\nAfter 10 years 120,338 114,724\n$ 142,718 $ 135,471\nAt December 31, 2023\nCost Fair Value\nWithin one year $ — $ —\nAfter one year through five years 5,679 5,035\nAfter 5 years through 10 years 31,162 28,084\nAfter 10 years 90,840 85,633\n$ 127,681 $ 118,752\nThere were no material realized gains or losses from available-for-sale debt securities during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThere were gross realized gains of $1,651 and gross realized losses of $1,416 from mutual funds and equities during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no material realized gains or losses from mutual funds and equities\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gains and losses from mutual funds and equities are reflected in Net\ngain (loss) from investments on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n16\nInvestments in Affiliated Funds\nThe Company has an investment in funds sponsored by LSV. The Company records this investment on the accompanying\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses from the change in fair value of these funds are\nrecognized in Net gain (loss) from investments on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe funds had a fair value of $8,410 and $7,316 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The\nCompany recognized unrealized gains of $673 and $66 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, from the change in fair value of the funds. The Company recognized unrealized gains of $1,094 and $472\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from the change in fair value of the funds.\nSecurities Owned\nThe Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary, SIDCO, has investments in U.S. government agency securities with maturity\ndates less than one year. These investments are reflected as Securities owned on the accompanying Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Due to specialized accounting practices applicable to investments by broker-dealers, the securities are\nreported at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in current period earnings. The securities had a fair value of\n$30,289 and $31,334 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were no material net gains or\nlosses related to the securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNote 6. Line of Credit\nThe Company has a five-year $325,000 Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and a\nsyndicate of other lenders. The Credit Facility is scheduled to expire in April 2026, at which time any aggregate principal\namount of loans outstanding becomes payable in full. Any borrowings made under the Credit Facility will accrue interest at\nrates that, at the Company's option, are based on a base rate (the Base Rate) plus a premium that can range from 0.25%\nto 1.00% or the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a premium that can range from 1.25% to\n2.00% depending on the Company’s Leverage Ratio (a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA for the\nfour preceding fiscal quarters, all as defined in the related agreement). The Base Rate is defined as the highest of a) the\nPrime Rate, b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and c) the Adjusted Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on\nsuch day plus 1.00%.\nThe Company also pays quarterly commitment fees based on the unused portion of the Credit Facility. The quarterly fees\nfor the Credit Facility can range from 0.15% of the amount of the unused portion to 0.30%, depending on the Company’s\nLeverage Ratio. Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company have guaranteed the obligations of the Company\nunder the agreement. The aggregate amount of the Credit Facility may be increased by an additional $100,000 under\ncertain conditions set forth in the agreement. The Company may issue up to $15,000 in letters of credit under the terms of\nthe Credit Facility. The Company pays a periodic commission fee of 1.25% plus an issuance fee of 0.20% of the\naggregate face amount of the outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains covenants with restrictions on the ability of the Company to do transactions with affiliates other\nthan wholly-owned subsidiaries or to incur liens or certain types of indebtedness as defined in the agreement. In the event\nof a default under the Credit Facility, the Company would also be restricted from paying dividends on, or repurchasing, its\ncommon stock without the approval of the lenders. Upon the occurrence of certain financial or economic events,\nsignificant corporate events, or certain other events of default constituting an event of default under the Credit Facility, all\nloans outstanding may be declared immediately due and payable and all commitments under the agreement may be\nterminated.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. As of October 22, 2024, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $4,866 under the Credit Facility. The\namount of the Credit Facility that is available for general corporate purposes as of October 22, 2024 was $320,134.\nNote 7. Shareholders’ Equity\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn April 2, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2024 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2024\nPlan), which was later approved by the shareholders of the Company on May 29, 2024. The 2024 Plan became effective\nupon receipt of the shareholders' approval on May 29, 2024 and is the successor equity compensation plan to the 2014\nEquity Compensation Plan (the 2014 Plan) which was merged with and into the 2024 Plan. The 2024 Plan provides for the\ngrant of stock options, stock units, stock awards, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. No further\ngrants will be made under the 2014 Plan, and shares with respect to all grants outstanding under the 2014 Plan will be\nissued or transferred under the 2024 Plan. Permitted grantees under the 2024 Plan include employees, non-employee\n17\ndirectors and consultants who perform services for the Company. The plan is administered by the Compensation\nCommittee of the Board of Directors of the Company. There were no grants of stock options, stock units, stock awards,\nstock appreciation rights or other stock-based awards made under the 2024 Plan as of June 30, 2024.\nThe Company has non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) outstanding under its equity\ncompensation plans. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense in its Consolidated Financial\nStatements in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStock-based compensation expense $ 13,696 $ 7,979 $ 37,224 $ 23,458\nLess: Deferred tax benefit (2,616) (1,438) (7,201) (4,278)\nStock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 11,080 $ 6,541 $ 30,023 $ 19,180\nThe vesting of the Company's RSUs are time-based and are not based on the achievement of performance targets. The\nmajority of the Company's RSUs will vest on the third anniversary of the issuance date. All outstanding stock options have\nperformance-based vesting provisions specific to each option grant that tie the vesting of the applicable stock options to\nthe Company’s financial performance. The Company’s stock options vest at a rate of 50% when a specified financial\nvesting target is achieved, and the remaining 50% when a second, higher specified financial vesting target is achieved.\nOptions vest as a result of achievement of the financial vesting targets. Options granted in December 2017 and thereafter\ninclude a service condition which requires a minimum two or four year waiting period from the grant date along with the\nattainment of the applicable financial vesting target. The targets are measured annually on December 31. The amount of\nstock-based compensation expense recognized in the period is based upon management’s estimate of when the financial\nvesting targets may be achieved. Any change in management’s estimate could result in the remaining amount of stock-\nbased compensation expense to be accelerated, spread out over a longer period, or reversed. This may cause volatility in\nthe recognition of stock-based compensation expense in future periods and could materially affect the Company’s\nearnings.\nThe Company revised its estimate of when some vesting targets are expected to be achieved. This change in\nmanagement's estimate resulted in an increase of $3,098 in stock-based compensation expense during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was approximately $85,239 of unrecognized compensation cost remaining related to\nunvested employee stock options and restricted stock units that management expects will vest and is being amortized.\nThe Company issues new common shares associated with the exercise of stock options. The total intrinsic value of\noptions exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $24,053. The total options exercisable as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 had an intrinsic value of $71,076. The total intrinsic value for options exercisable is calculated as the\ndifference between the market value of the Company’s common stock as of September 30, 2024 and the weighted\naverage exercise price of the options. The market value of the Company’s common stock as of September 30, 2024 was\n$69.19 as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC. The weighted average exercise price of the options exercisable as\nof September 30, 2024 was $55.98. Total options that were outstanding as of September 30, 2024 were 15,343,000. Total\noptions that were exercisable as of September 30, 2024 were 5,298,000.\nCommon Stock Buyback\nThe Company’s Board of Directors, under multiple authorizations, has authorized the repurchase of common stock on the\nopen market or through private transactions. The Company purchased 3,730,000 shares at a total cost of $252,978 during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, which reduced the total shares outstanding of common stock. The cost of\nstock purchases during the period includes the cost of excise taxes applicable to stock repurchases and certain\ntransactions that settled in the following quarter. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $29,100 of\nauthorization remaining for the purchase of common stock under the program. On October 22, 2024, the Company's\nBoard of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase program by an additional $400,000, increasing the\navailable authorization to approximately $429,100.\nThe Company immediately retires its common stock when purchased. Upon retirement, the Company reduces Capital in\nexcess of par value for the average capital per share outstanding and the remainder is charged against Retained\nearnings. If the Company reduces its Retained earnings to zero, any subsequent purchases of common stock will be\ncharged entirely to Capital in excess of par value.\n18\nCash Dividend\nOn May 29, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.46 per share on the Company's common stock,\nwhich was paid on June 18, 2024, to shareholders of record on June 10, 2024. Cash dividends declared during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $60,285 and $57,177, respectively.\nNote 8.

There are no inter-segment revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAssets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes. The accounting policies of the reportable business\nsegments are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the first quarter 2024 and made effective January 1, 2024, the Company made a determination to reorganize some\nof its business segments based on how its current Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) manages its businesses,\nincluding with respect to resource allocation and performance assessment. As a result, one of the Company's client\nrelationships formerly reported in the Private Banks segment will be reported in the Investment Managers segment and\nthe Company’s family office services business, formerly reported in the Investment Managers segment, will be reported in\nthe Investments in New Businesses segment. The business segment financial presentation was reclassified in 2024 to\nconform to this reorganization. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n19\nThe following tables highlight certain financial information about each of the business segments for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nInvestments\nPrivate Investment Institutional Investment In New\nBanks Advisors Investors Managers Businesses Total\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenues $ 138,734 $ 126,836 $ 71,626 $ 184,607 $ 15,593 $ 537,396\nExpenses 115,097 70,152 37,851 114,118 18,440 355,658\nOperating profit (loss) $ 23,637 $ 56,684 $ 33,775 $ 70,489 $ (2,847) $ 181,738\nInvestments\nPrivate Investment Institutional Investment In New\nBanks Advisors Investors Managers Businesses Total\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues $ 119,664 $ 110,461 $ 70,479 $ 162,982 $ 13,173 $ 476,759\nExpenses 111,207 64,280 39,953 103,585 18,265 337,290\nOperating profit (loss) $ 8,457 $ 46,181 $ 30,526 $ 59,397 $ (5,092) $ 139,469\nA reconciliation of the total operating profit reported for the business segments to income from operations in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nTotal operating profit from segments $ 181,738 $ 139,469\nCorporate overhead expenses (37,906) (30,997)\nIncome from operations $ 143,832 $ 108,472\nThe following tables provide additional information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 pertaining to\nthe business segments:\nCapital Expenditures (1) Depreciation\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPrivate Banks $ 2,764 $ 7,580 $ 2,620 $ 5,565\nInvestment Advisors 1,092 3,545 2,254 540\nInstitutional Investors 740 390 614 338\nInvestment Managers 7,196 2,804 1,659 2,227\nInvestments in New Businesses 124 262 186 280\nTotal from business segments $ 11,916 $ 14,581 $ 7,333 $ 8,950\nCorporate overhead 222 307 1,008 247\n$ 12,138 $ 14,888 $ 8,341 $ 9,197\n(1) Capital expenditures include additions to property and equipment and capitalized software.\nAmortization\n2024 2023\nPrivate Banks $ 5,147 $ 4,852\nInvestment Advisors 2,169 1,933\nInstitutional Investors 1,851 1,834\nInvestment Managers 80 209\nInvestments in New Businesses 1,096 895\nTotal from business segments $ 10,343 $ 9,723\nCorporate overhead 70 74\n$ 10,413 $ 9,797\n20\nThe following tables highlight certain financial information about each of business segment for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023:\nInvestments\nPrivate Investment Institutional Investment In New\nBanks Advisors Investors Managers Businesses Total\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nRevenues $ 401,272 $ 370,141 $ 214,911 $ 537,128 $ 44,509 $ 1,567,961\nExpenses 339,961 206,063 116,386 334,955 55,403 1,052,768\nOperating profit (loss) $ 61,311 $ 164,078 $ 98,525 $ 202,173 $ (10,894) $ 515,193\nInvestments\nPrivate Investment Institutional Investment In New\nBanks Advisors Investors Managers Businesses Total\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nRevenues $ 372,980 $ 326,579 $ 219,914 $ 476,683 $ 38,779 $ 1,434,935\nExpenses 337,834 192,004 126,337 308,483 52,919 1,017,577\nOperating profit (loss) $ 35,146 $ 134,575 $ 93,577 $ 168,200 $ (14,140) $ 417,358\nA reconciliation of the total operating profit reported for the business segments to income from operations in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\n2024 2023\nTotal operating profit from segments $ 515,193 $ 417,358\nCorporate overhead expenses (108,996) (94,518)\nIncome from operations $ 406,197 $ 322,840\nThe following tables provide additional information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nCapital Expenditures (2) Depreciation\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPrivate Banks $ 13,782 $ 24,652 $ 8,356 $ 16,370\nInvestment Advisors 6,244 11,499 6,625 1,557\nInstitutional Investors 2,589 1,495 1,816 922\nInvestment Managers 21,260 9,962 4,874 6,268\nInvestments in New Businesses 713 806 528 735\nTotal from business segments $ 44,588 $ 48,414 $ 22,199 $ 25,852\nCorporate Overhead 1,029 1,284 2,898 657\n$ 45,617 $ 49,698 $ 25,097 $ 26,509\n(2) Capital expenditures include additions to property and equipment and capitalized software.\nAmortization\n2024 2023\nPrivate Banks $ 15,347 $ 14,216\nInvestment Advisors 6,439 5,698\nInstitutional Investors 5,619 5,486\nInvestment Managers 161 566\nInvestments in New Businesses 3,461 2,685\nTotal from business segments $ 31,027 $ 28,651\nCorporate Overhead 257 200\n$ 31,284 $ 28,851\n21\nNote 10. Income Taxes\nThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $17,766 and\n$15,532, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties, of which $17,604 and $14,878 would affect the effective tax rate\nif the Company were to recognize the tax benefit.\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on\ntax returns was $2,232 and $1,385, respectively.\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross liability for unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties $ 17,766 $ 15,532\nInterest and penalties on unrecognized benefits 2,232 1,385\nTotal gross uncertain tax positions $ 19,998 $ 16,917\nAmount included in Current liabilities $ 3,713 $ 3,837\nAmount included in Other long-term liabilities 16,285 13,080\n$ 19,998 $ 16,917\nThe effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differs from the federal\nincome tax statutory rate due to the following:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nStatutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes, net of federal tax benefit 2.9 2.8 2.9 2.8\nForeign tax expense and tax rate differential 0.1 (0.1) 0.1 (0.1)\nTax benefit from stock option exercises (0.1) (0.6) (0.4) (0.3)\nOther, net (0.4) (0.6) (0.2) (0.2)\n23.5 % 22.5 % 23.4 % 23.2 %\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States on a consolidated basis and in many U.S. state and foreign\njurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination of income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and\nother domestic and foreign tax authorities. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for\nyears before 2020 and is no longer subject to state, local or foreign income tax examinations by authorities for years\nbefore 2018.\nThe Company estimates it will recognize $3,713 of gross unrecognized tax benefits. This amount is expected to be paid\nwithin one year or to be removed at the expiration of the statute of limitations and resolution of income tax audits and is\nnetted against the current payable account. These unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax positions taken on certain\nfederal, state, and foreign tax returns. However, the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain,\nand the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially\nfrom the amounts accrued for each year. While it is reasonably possible that some issues under examination could be\nresolved in the next twelve months, based upon the current facts and circumstances, the Company cannot reasonably\nestimate the timing of such resolution or the total range of potential changes as it relates to the current unrecognized tax\nbenefits that are recorded as part of the Company’s financial statements.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a framework to implement a global minimum\ncorporate tax of 15% for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar Two).\nCertain aspects of Pillar Two are effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects are effective January 1, 2025. While it is\nuncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which we operate have adopted\nlegislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement Pillar Two. The Company has\ndetermined Pillar Two will not have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate, consolidated results of\noperation, financial position, or cash flows.\nNote 11. Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company from time to time enters into contracts containing indemnification\nobligations of the Company. These obligations may require the Company to make payments to another party upon the\n22\noccurrence of certain events including the failure by the Company to meet its performance obligations under the contract.\nThese contractual indemnification provisions are often standard contractual terms of the nature customarily found in the\ntype of contracts entered into by the Company. In many cases, there are no stated or notional amounts included in the\nindemnification provisions. There are no amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 related to these indemnifications.\nRubicon Wealth Management\nPrior to the relationship termination described in the following sentence, SEI Private Trust Company (SPTC), a wholly-\nowned operating subsidiary of SEI, held custody accounts for the end-clients of Rubicon Wealth Management LLC, an\nSPTC investment advisor client (Rubicon). On May 1, 2024, SPTC terminated its client relationship with Rubicon in light of\nthe events associated with the Allegation (as defined below), and notified Rubicon clients with accounts at SPTC that they\nwere required to transfer their accounts to other custodians.\nBeginning on July 10, 2024, nine of Rubicon’s clients that had custodial accounts at SPTC filed state civil actions for fraud\nin the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania against Rubicon, its founder, Scott Mason, Mr.\nMason’s wife, Lynne Mason, and Orchard Park Real Estate Holdings LLC (Orchard Park), a business owned by the\nMasons. The fraud allegation (the Allegation) is based on the claim that Mr. Mason used Rubicon client funds to invest in\nOrchard Park, an entity allegedly formed and controlled by Mr. Mason, and that all such invested funds were subsequently\nwithdrawn from Orchard Park by the Masons and were used for their own, extensive personal expenses. It has been\nreported that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are currently investigating\nMr. Mason and his wife. The Company is also aware of at least two other cases filed in other jurisdictions against Rubicon\nand/or the Masons and Orchard Park, and there may be additional cases filed against Rubicon and/or the Masons of\nwhich the Company is unaware.\nAs of October 17, 2024, eight separate, but related, suits have been filed against SPTC in its capacity as custodian for the\nRubicon accounts of the plaintiffs. These actions were also filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County,\nPennsylvania and are: Star Sitron vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-17132 (Sitron); Charles Murray vs. SEI\nPrivate Trust Company, Case No. 2024-18391 (Murray); James A. Byrne & Sharon Byrne vs. SEI Private Trust Company,\nCase No. 2024-20612; Melody Pettinelli & Melody Pettinelli as Trustee of the Donald Pettinelli Trust dated 11/7/1996 vs.\nSEI Private Trust Company, Case. 2024-21377; Norman Love vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-21361;\nStephen Red & Carla Red vs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-21902; Edward A. Tettemer & Lyn K. Tettemer\nvs. SEI Private Trust Company, Case No. 2024-21827; and Jonathan Klein & Sara Klein vs. SEI Private Trust Company,\nCase No. 2024- 23294 (collectively, the Rubicon Actions). Based on the complaints that have thus far been filed in the\nRubicon Actions, these actions appear to be based generally on similar theories that include alleged breach of contract,\nbreach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and breach of state consumer protection laws by SPTC in connection with certain\ntransfers of Plaintiffs’ assets from SPTC custodial accounts to Orchard Park bank accounts. SPTC has been served with\ncomplaints in two of the Rubicon Actions, Sitron and Murray. In the remaining six Rubicon Actions, the plaintiffs have\ncommenced suit but have not filed their formal complaints. The Sitron and Murray cases are both in the early stages, with\ninitial motion practice and discovery now occurring.\nOn August 8, 2024, SPTC filed preliminary objections to the plaintiff’s complaint in Sitron, which remain pending. On\nSeptember 12, 2024 the Sitron court issued an initial case management order requiring, among other things, fact\ndiscovery to be completed within approximately 18 months and dispositive motions to be filed within 21 months from the\ncommencement of the action. On October 16, 2024, SPTC filed preliminary objections to the plaintiff’s claims in Murray,\nwhich also remain pending. On October 7, 2024, the Murray court issued an initial case management order requiring,\namong other things, fact discovery to be completed within nine months and dispositive motions to be filed within 12\nmonths of commencement of the action.\nWhile the Rubicon Actions are in their infancy and the ultimate outcomes of these litigations remain uncertain, SEI and\nSPTC intend to defend each of the Rubicon Actions. Currently, SPTC estimates that the aggregate amount of Rubicon\nclient assets transferred at the direction of Mr. Mason from SPTC custodial accounts to Orchard Park bank accounts is\napproximately $15,000. In the event that SPTC is unsuccessful in its defense of the Rubicon Actions, SEI does not\ncurrently believe that the losses associated with such unsuccessful defense would exceed the approximately $15,000 of\nRubicon client assets that Mr. Mason directed to be transferred to Orchard Park.\nUnited Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority Supervisory Review of SEI Investments (Europe) Limited\nOn July 31, 2024, SEI Investments (Europe) Limited (SIEL), an indirectly, wholly-owned operating subsidiary of SEI,\nreceived a final requirement notice from the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (the FCA) under section\n166(3)(a) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), requiring SIEL to engage a “Skilled Person” to\nundertake a two-stage review of SIEL’s governance arrangements and control environment. In the first stage, the Skilled\nPerson will provide SIEL and the FCA with a report setting out the Skilled Person’s view of the effectiveness of the control\n23\nenvironment and governance arrangements with respect to key risks, as well as the Skilled Person’s recommendations\nwhere necessary to address any identified weaknesses (the Section 166 Report). In the second stage, the Skilled Person\nwill provide an independent view of the quality and completeness of the remediation carried out by SIEL to address any\nfindings from the initial stage and any self-identified weaknesses, including a view on SIEL’s compliance with relevant\nregulations.\nThe appointment of a Skilled Person is one of the regulatory tools used by the FCA to supervise and monitor firms it\nregulates. A Skilled Person is an independent third party expert with the relevant knowledge and experience to undertake\na review as described above. The FCA may use the Section 166 Report and any associated information or documents\nprovided by the Skilled Person in connection with the exercise of any of its statutory functions including its supervisory and\nenforcement powers.\nIn August 2024, SIEL, with the approval of FCA, appointed the firm of Grant Thornton to act as the Skilled Person. The\nfirst stage of the Section 166 Report is expected to be completed in early December 2024. Grant Thornton has begun its\nfact-finding process. SIEL looks forward to receiving the views of the Skilled Person in the Section 166 Report and is\ncommitted to working with the FCA and Grant Thornton to implement any recommendations for its control environment or\ngovernance arrangements, as appropriate. Until SIEL receives the Section 166 Report, neither SIEL nor SEI is reasonably\nable to provide an estimate of the costs or consequences that may be associated with the Section 166 requirement notice.\nOther Matters\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are party to various other examinations, investigations, actions and claims\narising in the normal course of business that the Company does not believe are material. The Company believes that the\nultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or the\nmanner in which the Company conducts its business. Currently, the Company does not believe the amount of losses\nassociated with these matters can be estimated. While the Company does not believe that the amount of such losses will,\nwhen liquidated or estimable, be material to its financial position, the assumptions may be incorrect and any such loss\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or the manner in which the Company\nconducts its business in the period(s) during which the underlying matters are resolved.\nNote 12. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of the Company's goodwill by segment are as follows:\nInstitutional Investment Investments in\nInvestors Managers New Businesses Total\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 61,884 $ 56,990 $ 18,459 $ 137,333\nMeasurement period adjustments 25 — — 25\nReclassification due to segment reorganization — (1,711) 1,711 —\nForeign currency translation adjustments 730 (3) — 727\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ 62,639 $ 55,276 $ 20,170 $ 138,085\nThe reclassification of the Company's goodwill by segment during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the\nrelative fair value allocation of the goodwill related to the businesses that were reclassified into the new segment (See\nNote 9).\nIn November 2023, the Company's wholly-owned operating subsidiary in the United Kingdom, SIEL, acquired all of the\noutstanding equity of XPS Pensions (Nexus) Limited, principal employer and scheme funder of the National Pensions\nTrust (NPT), from its parent company, XPS Pensions Group PLC (XPS). The total purchase price for XPS Pensions\n(Nexus) Limited included a contingent consideration payable to the sellers subject to the achievement of certain post-\nclosing performance measurements determined during intervals occurring within two years immediately following the\nclosing date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made an adjustment of $1,547 which\nreduced the fair value of the contingent consideration. The fair value adjustment to the contingent consideration is\nreflected in Facilities, supplies and other costs on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe fair value of the contingent consideration of $2,611 is included in Other long-term liabilities on the accompanying\nBalance Sheet.\nThe Company recognized $10,066 and $9,178 of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n24\nNote 13.

Average assets under\nadministration increased $132.4 billion, or 15%, to $998.4 billion during the first nine months of 2024, as\ncompared to $866.0 billion during the first nine months of 2023.\n• Revenue from Asset management, administration and distribution fees also increased from market appreciation\nand positive cash flows into separately managed account programs and Strategist programs of the Investment\nAdvisors segment. This was partially offset by negative cash flows from SEI fund programs and fee reductions in\nseparately managed account programs. Revenue growth was also partially offset by client losses in the\nInstitutional Investors segment. Average assets under management in equity and fixed income programs,\nexcluding LSV, increased $8.8 billion, or 5%, to $177.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to\n$169.1 billion during the first nine months of 2023.\n• Fees from the SEI Integrated Cash Program of the Investment Advisors segment launched in December 2023\nwere $10.7 million during the third quarter of 2024 and $30.4 million during the first nine months of 2024.\n• Revenue from Information processing and software servicing fees increased in the first nine months of 2024\nprimarily from new client conversions and growth from existing SEI Wealth PlatformSM (SWP) clients. A one-time\nearly contractual buyout fee of $10.5 million recorded during the second quarter of 2023 from an investment\n29\nprocessing client of the Private Banks segment acquired by an existing client partially offset the increase in\nrevenues.\n• Earnings from LSV increased to $102.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $91.5 million in the\nfirst nine months of 2023 due to market appreciation and higher performance fees. Negative cash flows from\nexisting clients and client losses partially offset the increase in earnings from LSV.\n• Operating expenses increased from higher personnel costs due to business growth, primarily in the Investment\nManagers segment, stock-based compensation, and the impact of inflation on wages and services. Cost\ncontainment measures related to consulting and other vendor costs partially offset the increase in operating\nexpenses in the first nine months of 2024.\n• Capitalized software development costs were $18.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, of which $10.5 million\nwas for continued enhancements to SWP. Capitalized software development costs also include $5.0 million of\nsoftware development costs in the first nine months of 2024 for a new platform for the Investment Managers\nsegment.\n• Amortization expense related to SWP was $20.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $19.0\nmillion in the first nine months of 2023.\n• Interest and dividend income was $36.0 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $29.5 million in\nthe first nine months of 2023. The increase in interest and dividend income was due to an overall increase in\ninterest rates and higher invested cash balances.\n• In July 2024, SEI sold a condominium located in New York, New York and recognized a net pre-tax gain of $8.2\nmillion, or $0.05 diluted earnings per share, after associated costs and expenses.

The increase in expense was primarily due to new equity awards granted\nduring the fourth quarter 2023. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is primarily based upon\nmanagement's estimate of when the financial vesting targets of outstanding stock options may be achieved. Any change\nin the estimate could result in the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be accelerated, spread out over a\nlonger period, or reversed. This may cause volatility in the recognition of stock-based compensation expense in future\nperiods and could materially affect earnings (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n39\nWe revised our estimate of when some vesting targets are expected to be achieved. This change in estimate resulted in\nan increase of $3.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We\nexpect to recognize approximately $31.9 million in stock-based compensation expense during the remainder of 2024.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of financial assets and liabilities, except for the investment funds sponsored by LSV, is determined in\naccordance with the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the investment funds sponsored by LSV is measured using the\nnet asset value per share (NAV) as a practical expedient. The fair value of all other financial assets are determined using\nLevel 1 or Level 2 inputs and consist mainly of investments in equity or fixed-income mutual funds that are quoted daily\nand Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and other U.S. government agency securities that are single\nissuer pools that are valued based on current market data of similar assets. Level 3 financial liabilities at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 consist entirely of the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration resulting from an\nacquisition (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nRegulatory Matters\nLike many firms operating within the financial services industry, we are experiencing a complex and changing regulatory\nenvironment across our markets. Our current scale and reach as a provider to the financial services industry, the\nintroduction and implementation of new solutions for our financial services industry clients, the increased regulatory\noversight of the financial services industry generally, new laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry and\never-changing regulatory interpretations of existing laws and regulations, and a greater propensity of regulators to pursue\nenforcement actions and other sanctions against regulated entities, have made this an increasingly challenging and costly\nregulatory environment in which to operate.\nSEI and some of our regulated subsidiaries have undergone or been scheduled to undergo a range of periodic or thematic\nreviews, examinations or investigations by numerous regulatory authorities around the world, including the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the\nFinancial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (FCA), the Central Bank of Ireland and others. These regulatory\nactivities typically result in the identification of matters or practices to be addressed by us or our subsidiaries and, in\ncertain circumstances, the regulatory authorities require remediation activities or pursue enforcement proceedings against\nus or our subsidiaries. From time to time, the regulators in different jurisdictions will elevate their level of scrutiny of our\noperations as our business expands or is deemed critical to the operations of the relevant financial markets. As described\nunder the caption “Regulatory Considerations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the range of possible sanctions that\nare available to regulatory authorities include limitations on our ability to engage in business for specified periods of time,\nthe revocation of registration, censures and fines. The direct and indirect costs of responding to these regulatory activities\nand of complying with new or modified regulations, as well as the potential financial costs and potential reputational\nimpact against us of any enforcement proceedings that might result, is uncertain but could have a material adverse impact\non our operating results or financial position.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 427,074 $ 345,982\nNet cash used in investing activities (57,185) (48,237)\nNet cash used in financing activities (310,392) (294,886)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 6,941 (1,474)\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 66,438 1,385\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period 834,998 853,359\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period $ 901,436 $ 854,744\nOur credit facility provides for borrowings up to $325.0 million and is scheduled to expire in April 2026 (See Note 6 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements). As of October 22, 2024, we had outstanding letters of credit of $4.9 million which\nreduced the amount available under the credit facility. These letters of credit were primarily issued for the expansion of the\ncorporate headquarters and are due to expire in late 2024. As of October 22, 2024, the amount of the credit facility\navailable for corporate purposes was $320.1 million.\nThe availability of the credit facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants set forth in the agreement. The credit\nfacility contains covenants which restrict our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates other than wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries or to incur liens or certain types of indebtedness as defined in the agreement. In the event of a default under\n40\nthe credit facility, we would also be restricted from paying dividends on, or repurchasing our common stock. Currently, our\nability to borrow from the credit facility is not limited by any covenant of the agreement (See Note 6 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\nThe majority of excess cash reserves are primarily placed in accounts located in the United States that invest entirely in\nSEI-sponsored money market mutual funds denominated in the U.S. dollar. We also utilize demand deposit accounts or\nmoney market accounts at several large, well-established financial institutions located in the United States. The\ninstitutions we utilize have not indicated any stability issues regarding the ability to honor current or future deposit\nobligations to their customers. Accounts used to manage these excess cash reserves do not impose any restrictions or\nlimitations that would prevent us from being able to access such cash amounts immediately. As of October 22, 2024, the\namount of cash and cash equivalents considered free and immediately accessible for other general corporate purposes\nwas $520.6 million.\nCash and cash equivalents include accounts managed by subsidiaries that are used in their operations or to cover specific\nbusiness and regulatory requirements. The availability of this cash for other purposes beyond the operations of these\nsubsidiaries may be limited. We therefore do not include accounts of foreign subsidiaries in the calculation of free and\nimmediately accessible cash for other general corporate purposes. A portion of the undistributed earnings of foreign\nsubsidiaries are deemed repatriated. Any subsequent transfer of available cash related to the repatriated earnings of\nforeign subsidiaries could significantly increase free and immediately accessible cash.\nCash flows from operations increased $81.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of\n2023 primarily from the increase in net income. The negative impact from the change in working capital accounts,\nprimarily due to increased client receivables, partially offset the increase in cash flows from operations.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes:\n• Purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities. Purchases, sales and maturities of marketable\nsecurities in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nPurchases $ (134,665) $ (83,968)\nSales and maturities 121,347 90,245\nNet investing activities from marketable securities $ (13,318) $ 6,277\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to marketable securities.\n• The capitalization of costs incurred in developing computer software. We capitalized $18.4 million of software\ndevelopment costs in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to $26.6 million in the first nine months of 2023.\nSoftware development costs are principally related to significant enhancements for the expanded functionality of\nthe SEI Wealth Platform and a new platform for the Investment Managers segment.\n• Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2024 were $27.2 million as compared to\n$23.1 million in the first nine months of 2023. Expenditures in 2024 and 2023 include capital outlays for purchased\nsoftware and equipment for data center operations. We continue to evaluate improvements to our information\ntechnology infrastructure which, if implemented, will result in additional expenditures for purchased software and\nequipment for data center operations.\n• Proceeds from fixed asset dispositions. We received proceeds of $9.9 million after associated costs and\nexpenses from the sale of property located in New York, New York in the third quarter 2024.\n• Other investing activities. In February 2024, we made a strategic investment of $10.0 million in an innovation\nplatform for wealth management.\nNet cash used in financing activities includes:\n• The repurchase of common stock. Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of common stock\nthrough multiple authorizations. Currently, there is no expiration date for the common stock repurchase program.\nWe had total capital outlays of $252.9 million during the first nine months of 2024 and $236.9 million during the\nfirst nine months of 2023 for the repurchase of common stock.\n• Proceeds from the issuance of common stock. We received $62.8 million and $65.7 million in proceeds from the\nissuance of common stock during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. These proceeds were\nprimarily from stock option exercise activity.\n• Dividend payments. Cash dividends paid were $120.3 million in the first nine months of 2024 as compared to\n$114.8 million in the first nine months of 2023.\n41\nCash Requirements\nCash requirements and liquidity needs are primarily funded through cash flow from operations and our capacity for\nadditional borrowing. At September 30, 2024, unused sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and the\namount available under our credit facility.\nWe are obligated to make payments in connection with the credit facility, operating leases, maintenance contracts and\nother commitments. We believe our operating cash flow, available borrowing capacity, and existing cash and cash\nequivalents will provide adequate funds for these obligations and ongoing operations. We currently anticipate that our\navailable funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our stock\nrepurchase program for at least the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.\nForward-Looking Information and Risk Factors\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements. Certain\ninformation contained in this discussion is or may be considered forward-looking. Forward-looking statements relate to\nfuture operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based upon\nestimates and assumptions that involve certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are\nsubject to change. Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, they could be inaccurate. Our actual future\nrevenues and income could differ materially from our expected results. We have no obligation to publicly update or revise\nany forward-looking statements.\nAmong the risks and uncertainties which may affect our future operations, strategies, financial results or other\ndevelopments are those risks described in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1A. These risks include\nthe following:\n• changes in capital markets and significant changes in the value of financial instruments that may affect our\nrevenues and earnings;\n• product development risk;\n• risk of failure by a third-party service provider;\n• pricing pressure from increased competition, disruptive technology and poor investment performance;\n• the affect on our earnings and cashflows from the performance of LSV Asset Management;\n• consolidation within our target markets;\n• external factors affecting the fiduciary management market;\n• software defects, development delays or installation difficulties, which would harm our business and reputation\nand expose us to potential liability;\n• data and cyber security risks;\n• risk of the disclosure and misuse of personal data;\n• risk of outages, data losses, and disruptions of services;\n• intellectual property risks;\n• third-party service providers in our operations;\n• poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those\nwhich we offer or for products that generate lower fees;\n• investment advisory contracts which may be terminated or may not be renewed on favorable terms;\n• the effect of governmental regulation;\n• our ability to meet competing and/or conflicting regulatory requirements of the different jurisdictions;\n• our ability to address conflicts of interest appropriately;\n• fiduciary or other legal liability for client losses from our investment management operations;\n• the results of commercial disputes, litigation and regulatory examinations and investigations;\n• effective business strategies;\n• our ability to capture the expected value from acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, minority investments or\nstrategic alliances;\n• increased costs and regulatory risks from the growth of our business;\n• operational risks associated with the processing of investment transactions;\n• disruptions of operations of other participants in the global financial system;\n42\n• our ability to hire and retain qualified employees;\n• the competence and integrity of our employees and third-parties;\n• our ability to receive dividends or other payments in needed amounts from our subsidiaries;\n• changes in, or interpretation of, accounting principles or tax rules and regulations;\n• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n• fluctuations in interest rates affecting the value of our fixed-income investment securities;\n• financial and non-financial covenants which may restrict our ability to manage liquidity needs;\n• stockholder activism efforts;\n• retention of executive officers and senior management personnel;\n• the effectiveness of our business, risk management and business continuity strategies, models and processes;\n• unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of pandemic, extreme weather events or other\nnatural disasters;\n• geopolitical unrest and other events;\n• climate change concerns and incidents; and\n• environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters.\nWe conduct operations through many regulated wholly-owned subsidiaries. These subsidiaries include:\n• SEI Investments Distribution Co., or SIDCO, a broker-dealer registered with the SEC under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA;\n• SEI Investments Management Corporation, or SIMC, an investment advisor registered with the SEC under the\nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940 and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, under the\nCommodity Exchange Act;\n• SEI Private Trust Company, or SPTC, a limited purpose federal thrift chartered and regulated by the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency;\n• SEI Trust Company, or STC, a Pennsylvania trust company, regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of\nBanking and Securities;\n• SEI Institutional Transfer Agent, Inc., or SITA, a transfer agent registered with the SEC under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934;\n• SEI Investments (Europe) Limited, or SIEL, an investment manager and financial institution subject to regulation\nby the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom;\n• SEI Investments Canada Company, or SEI Canada, an investment fund manager that has various other\ncapacities that is regulated by the Ontario Securities Commission and various provincial authorities;\n• SEI Investments Global, Limited, or SIGL, a management company for Undertakings for Collective Investment in\nTransferable Securities, or UCITS, and for Alternative Investment Funds, or AIFs, that is regulated primarily by\nthe Central Bank of Ireland, or CBI;\n• SEI Investments - Global Fund Services, Ltd., or GFSL, an authorized provider of administration services for Irish\nand non-Irish collective investment schemes that is regulated by the CBI;\n• SEI Investments - Depositary and Custodial Services (Ireland) Limited, or D&C, an authorized provider of\ndepositary and custodial services that is regulated by the CBI;\n• SEI Investments - Luxembourg S.A., or SEI Lux, a professional of the specialized financial sector subject to\nregulation by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;\n• SEI Investments Global (Cayman), Ltd., a full mutual fund administrator that is regulated by the Cayman Island\nMonetary Authority; and\n• SEI Investments (South Africa) (PTY) Limited, a Private Company that is a licensed Financial Service Provider\nregulated by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority.\nIn addition to the regulatory authorities listed above, our subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities\nin other foreign countries. In addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we also own a minority interest of approximately\n38.6% in LSV, which is also an investment advisor registered with the SEC.\nThe Company, its regulated subsidiaries, their regulated services and solutions and their customers are all subject to\nextensive legislation, regulation, and supervision that recently has been subject to, and continues to experience,\n43\nsignificant change and increased regulatory activity. These changes and regulatory activities could have a material\nadverse effect on us and our clients.\nThe various governmental agencies and self-regulatory authorities that regulate or supervise the Company and its\nsubsidiaries have broad administrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with laws, regulations, and requirements\nof these agencies and authorities, the possible business process changes required or sanctions that may be imposed\ninclude the suspension of individual employees, limitations on our ability to engage in business for specified periods of\ntime, the revocation of applicable registration as a broker-dealer, investment advisor or other regulated entity, and, as the\ncase may be, censures and fines. Additionally, certain securities and banking laws applicable to us and our subsidiaries\nprovide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil litigation. Any litigation could have significant financial\nand non-financial consequences including monetary judgments and the requirement to take action or limit activities that\ncould ultimately affect our business.\nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies, and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating\nto our regulated subsidiaries and their activities, services and solutions, our business practices, our past actions and other\nmatters has increased dramatically in the past several years. Responding to these examinations, investigations, actions,\nand lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time consuming and expensive and can divert the\ntime and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties, fines and changes to business processes sought\nby regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years, and certain regulators have been more\nlikely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to advance or support legislation targeted at the financial\nservices industry. We continue to be subject to inquiries from examinations and investigations by supervisory and\nenforcement divisions of regulatory authorities and expect this to continue in the future. We believe this is also the case\nwith many of our regulated clients. Governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a\nnegative impact on our reputation, our relationship with clients and prospective clients, and on the morale and\nperformance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws that require implementation of\nregulations applicable to financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification and monitoring\nclient transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. We offer investment and banking solutions that also\nare subject to regulation by the federal and state securities and banking authorities, as well as foreign regulatory\nauthorities, where applicable. Existing or future regulations that affect these solutions could lead to a reduction in sales of\nthese solutions or require modifications of these solutions.\nWe must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control\n(OFAC) and similar national and multinational bodies and governmental agencies outside the United States, as well as\nanti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. We can incur higher costs and face\ngreater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a\nviolation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject\nus and our subsidiaries, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and\ncriminal penalties.\nOur businesses are also subject to privacy and data protection information security legal requirements concerning the use\nand protection of certain personal information. These include those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and\nthe Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 in the United States, the General Data Protection Regulation\n(GDPR) in the EU, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Cayman Islands' Data\nProtection Law, and various other laws. Privacy and data security legislation is a priority issue in many states and\nlocalities in the United States, as well as foreign jurisdictions outside of the EU. For example, California enacted the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which broadly regulates the sale of the consumer information of California\nresidents and grants California residents certain rights to, among other things, access and delete data about them in\ncertain circumstances. Other states are considering similar proposals. Such attempts by the states to regulate have the\npotential to create a patchwork of differing and/or conflicting state regulations. Ensuring compliance under ever-evolving\nprivacy legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA, is an ongoing commitment, which involves substantial costs.\nCompliance with existing and future regulations and responding to and complying with recent increased regulatory activity\naffecting broker-dealers, investment advisors, investment companies, financial institutions, and their service providers\ncould have a significant impact on us. We periodically undergo regulatory examinations and respond to regulatory\ninquiries and document requests. In addition, recent and continuing legislative activity in the United States and in other\njurisdictions (including the European Union and the United Kingdom) have made and continue to make extensive changes\nto the laws regulating financial services firms. As a result of these examinations, inquiries, and requests, as a result of\nincreased civil litigation activity, and as a result of these new laws and regulations, we engage legal counsel and other\nsubject matter experts, review our compliance procedures, solution and service offerings, and business operations, and\n44\nmake changes as we deem necessary or as may be required by the applicable authority. These additional activities and\nrequired changes may result in increased expense or may reduce revenues.\nOur bank clients are subject to supervision by federal, state, and foreign banking and financial services authorities\nconcerning the manner in which such clients purchase and receive our products and services. Our plan sponsor clients\nand our subsidiaries providing services to those clients are subject to supervision by the Department of Labor and\ncompliance with employee benefit regulations. Investment advisor and broker-dealer clients are regulated by the SEC,\nstate securities authorities, or FINRA. Existing or future regulations applicable to our clients may affect our clients’\npurchase of our products and services.\nIn addition, see the discussion of governmental regulations in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our latest Annual Report on Form\n10-K for a description of the risks that the current regulatory regimes and proposed regulatory changes may present for\nour business.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInformation required by this item is set forth under the captions \"Our revenues and earnings are affected by changes in\ncapital markets and significant changes in the value of financial instruments\" and \"Changes in interest rates may affect the\nvalue of our fixed-income investment securities\" in Item 1A Risk Factors and under the caption \"Sensitivity of our revenues\nand earnings to capital market fluctuations\" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no\nmaterial changes to this information as it is disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that\nevaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures\nas of the end of the period covered by this report are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us\nin reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,\ncontrols and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it\nfiles or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management including its principal\nexecutive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure. A controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute\nassurance that the objectives of the controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\n(b) Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has\nmaterially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n45\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings, examinations\nand investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe are material. These types of\nmatters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-\nmonetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of any of these matters will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on SEI as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a\nmaterial effect on our net earnings in any particular interim reporting period. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or\nother proceedings with certainty. These matters include the proceedings summarized in “Note 11. Commitments and\nContingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInformation regarding risk factors appears in Part I – Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in the risk factors from those disclosed in the Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for 2023.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\n(e) Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $5.828 billion worth of our common stock through\nmultiple authorizations through September 30, 2024. Currently, there is no expiration date for the common stock\nrepurchase program. On October 22, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the stock repurchase\nprogram by an additional $400.0 million, increasing the available authorization to approximately $429.1 million.\nInformation regarding the repurchase of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is as\nfollows:\nApproximate Dollar\nTotal Number of Value of Shares that\nTotal Number Average Shares Purchased as May Yet Be\nof Shares Price Paid Part of Publicly Purchased\nPeriod Purchased per Share (1) Announced Program Under the Program\nJuly 2024 125,000 $ 67.28 125,000 $ 106,504,000\nAugust 2024 623,000 66.02 623,000 65,359,000\nSeptember 2024 525,000 67.64 525,000 29,100,000\nTotal 1,273,000 $ 66.81 1,273,000\n(1) Average price paid per share does not include excise tax on stock repurchases.\nItem 5. Other Information.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers or directors adopted or terminated any contract,\ninstruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense\nconditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" (as defined in Item 408 (c) of Regulation S-K).\n46\nItem 6.

Denham\nSean J. Denham\nChief Financial Officer\n48\nExhibit 10.1\nMay 23, 2024\nMichael Lane\n[RESIDENCE ADDRESS OMITTED]\nDear Michael:\nOn behalf of SEI, we are pleased to extend this offer of employment to you, to perform the role of\nExecutive Vice President - Asset Management at SEI.

To the extent\n2024 Proxy Statement 75\nany Grants are paid in cash, and not in shares of Company Stock, any shares previously subject to such Grants shall again be available\nfor issuance or transfer under the Plan.\n(c) Substitute Grants. Substitute Grants shall not reduce the number of shares of Company Stock available under the\nPlan and available shares under a shareholder approved plan of an acquired company (as appropriately adjusted to reflect the\ntransaction) may be used for Grants under this Plan and shall not reduce this Plan’s share reserve (subject to applicable stock exchange\nlisting rules and Code requirements). Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any affiliate with which the\nCompany or any subsidiary combined has shares available under a preexisting plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in\ncontemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such preexisting plan (as\nadjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition\nor combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or\ncombination) may be used for Grants under the Plan and shall not reduce the number of shares of Company Stock authorized for grant\nunder the Plan (and shares of Company Stock subject to such Grants shall not be added to the shares of Company Stock available for\nGrants under the Plan as provided in Section 5(a)); provided that Grants using such available shares shall not be made after the date\nawards or grants could have been made under the terms of the preexisting plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be\nmade to individuals who were not employees or directors prior to such acquisition or combination.

For purposes of this limit, the value of such Grants shall be calculated based on the grant date fair value\nof such Grants for financial reporting purposes.\n(e) Adjustments. If there is any change in the number or kind of shares of Company Stock outstanding by reason of (i) a\nstock dividend, spinoff, recapitalization, stock split, or combination or exchange of shares, (ii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation,\n(iii) a reclassification or change in par value, or (iv) any other extraordinary or unusual event affecting the outstanding Company Stock\nas a class without the Company’s receipt of consideration, or if the value of outstanding shares of Company Stock is substantially\nreduced as a result of a spinoff or the Company’s payment of an extraordinary dividend or distribution, the maximum number and kind\nof shares of Company Stock available for issuance or transfer under the Plan, the maximum number and kind of shares of Company\nStock for which any individual may receive Grants in any year, the number and kind of shares covered by outstanding Grants, the\nnumber and kind of shares issued or transferred and to be issued or transferred under the Plan, and the price per share or the applicable\nmarket value of such Grants shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee, in such manner as the Committee determines in its\ndiscretion to be appropriate, to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of, or change in the kind of, the issued or transferred\nshares of Company Stock to preclude, to the extent practicable, the enlargement or dilution of rights and benefits under the Plan and\nsuch outstanding Grants; provided, however, that any fractional shares resulting from such adjustment shall be eliminated.

Performance goals need not be uniform among Participants.\n13.

Consequences of a Change of Control\n(a) Assumption of Outstanding Awards. Upon a Change of Control where the Company is not the surviving corporation\n(or survives only as a subsidiary of another corporation), unless the Committee determines otherwise, all outstanding Grants that are\nnot exercised, unvested or paid at the time of the Change of Control shall be continued, assumed by, or replaced with grants that have\ncomparable terms by, the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation). After a Change of Control,\nreferences to the “Company” as they relate to employment matters shall include the successor employer in the transaction, subject to\napplicable law. For purposes of the foregoing, a Grant under the Plan shall not be treated as continued, assumed, or replaced on\ncomparable terms unless it is continued, assumed, or replaced with substantially equivalent terms, including, without limitation, the\nsame vesting terms.\n(b) Vesting Upon Certain Termination Events. Unless otherwise set forth in a Grant Agreement, with respect to Grants, if\n(i) a Change of Control occurs and (ii) during the period commencing on the date of the Change of Control and ending on the date that\nis 24 months following the Change of Control, the Participant’s employment or service with the Employer is terminated (1) by the\nEmployer without Cause, (2) by the Participant for Good Reason, (3) by the Employer on account of the Participant’s Disability or (4) on\naccount of the Participant’s death, then all outstanding Options and SARs shall vest and become exercisable and all other outstanding\nGrants shall vest and all restrictions pertaining to such other Grants shall lapse and have no further effect. For the purposes of this\nSection 16(b) any Grant that vests based on the attainment of performance goals shall vest assuming that the performance goals were\nattained at the target level of performance, or at such greater level of performance as the Committee may determine. To the extent\nOptions and SARs vest and become exercisable in accordance with this Section 16(b)they will remain exercisable for 12 months following\nthe termination of the Participant’s employment or service, provided that, in no event shall any Option or SAR be exercisable after the\nexpiration of its term.\n(c) Other Alternatives. In the event of a Change of Control, if any outstanding Grants are not assumed by, or replaced\nwith grants that have comparable terms by, the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), the\nCommittee may (but is not obligated to) make adjustments to the terms and conditions of outstanding Grants, including, without\nlimitation, taking any of the following actions (or combination thereof) with respect to any or all outstanding Grants, without the\nconsent of any Participant: (i) the Committee may determine that outstanding Options and SARs shall automatically accelerate and\nbecome fully exercisable and the restrictions and conditions on outstanding Stock Awards, Stock Units, Other Stock-Based Awards and\nDividend Equivalents shall immediately lapse; (ii) the Committee may determine that Participants shall receive a payment in settlement\nof outstanding Stock Units, Other Stock-Based Awards or Dividend Equivalents, in such amount and form as may be determined by the\nCommittee; (iii) the Committee may require that Participants surrender their outstanding Options and SARs in exchange for a payment\nby the Company, in cash or Company Stock as determined by the Committee, in an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the\nthen Fair Market Value of the shares of Company Stock subject to the Participant’s unexercised Options and SARs exceeds the Option\nExercise Price or SAR base amount, and (iv) after giving Participants an opportunity to exercise all of their outstanding Options and\nSARs, the Committee may terminate any or all unexercised Options and SARs at such time as the Committee deems appropriate. Such\nsurrender, termination or payment shall take place as of the date of the Change of Control or such other date as the Committee may\nspecify. Without limiting the foregoing, if the per share Fair Market Value of the Company Stock does not exceed the per share Option\nExercise Price or SAR base amount, as applicable, the Company shall not be required to make any payment to the Participant upon\nsurrender of the Option or SAR.\n17. Requirements for Issuance of Shares\nNo Company Stock shall be issued in connection with any Grant hereunder unless and until all legal requirements applicable to the\nissuance of such Company Stock have been complied with to the satisfaction of the Committee. The Committee shall have the right to\ncondition any Grant made to any Participant hereunder on such Participant’s undertaking in writing to comply with such restrictions on\nhis or her subsequent disposition of such shares of Company Stock as the Committee shall deem necessary or advisable, and\ncertificates, or electronic book entry equivalents, representing such shares may be legended to reflect any such restrictions.\nCertificates, or electronic book entry equivalents, representing shares of Company Stock issued under the Plan may be subject to such\nstop-transfer orders and other restrictions as may be required by applicable laws, regulations and interpretations, including any\n2024 Proxy Statement 81\nrequirement that a legend be placed thereon.

The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that the Board shall not\namend the Plan without approval of the shareholders of the Company if such approval is required in order to comply with the Code or\napplicable laws, or to comply with applicable stock exchange requirements. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the\nBoard may amend the Plan in such manner as it deems appropriate in the event of a change in applicable law or regulations.\n(b) No Repricing Without Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, except in\nconnection with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split,\nextraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, or exchange of\nshares), the terms of outstanding Grants may not be amended to reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding Options or exercise price or\nbase amount of SARs or cancel outstanding Options or SARs in exchange for cash, other Grants of Options or SARs with an Exercise\nPrice or base amount that is less than the Exercise Price or base amount of the original Options or SARs without shareholder approval.\n(c) Termination of Plan. The Plan shall terminate on the day immediately preceding the tenth anniversary of its Effective\nDate, unless the Plan is terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the shareholders. The\ntermination of the Plan shall not impair Grants outstanding or the power and authority of the Committee with respect to an\noutstanding Grant.\n(d) Termination and Amendment of Outstanding Grants. A termination or amendment of the Plan that occurs after a\nGrant is made shall not materially impair the rights of a Participant with respect to such Grant unless the Participant consents or unless\nthe Committee acts under Section 19(c) below. The termination of the Plan shall not impair the power and authority of the Committee\nwith respect to an outstanding Grant. Whether or not the Plan has terminated, an outstanding Grant may be terminated or amended\nunder Section 19(c) below or may be amended by agreement of the Company and the Participant consistent with the Plan.\n19.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee may make a Grant to an employee of another\ncorporation who becomes an Employee by reason of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or property, reorganization\nor liquidation involving the Company in substitution for a grant made by such corporation. The terms and conditions of the Grants may\nvary from the terms and conditions required by the Plan and from those of the substituted stock incentives, as determined by the\nCommittee.\n(c) Compliance with Law.\n(i)The Plan, the exercise of Options and the obligations of the Company to issue or transfer shares of Company Stock\nunder Grants shall be subject to all applicable laws and to approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be\nrequired. With respect to persons subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that the Plan and\nall transactions under the Plan comply with all applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. In\naddition, it is the intent of the Company that Incentive Stock Options comply with the applicable provisions of section 422 of\nthe Code. To the extent that any legal requirement of section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 422 as set forth in the Plan\nceases to be required under section 16 of the Exchange Act or section 422 of the Code, that Plan provision shall cease to apply.\nThe Committee may revoke any Grant if it is contrary to law or modify a Grant to bring it into compliance with any valid and\nmandatory government regulation. The Committee may also adopt rules regarding the withholding of taxes on payments to\nParticipants. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, agree to limit its authority under this Section.\n(ii)The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. Each\nGrant shall be construed and administered such that the Grant either (A) qualifies for an exemption from the requirements of\n82 2024 Proxy Statement\nsection 409A of the Code or (B) satisfies the requirements of section 409A of the Code. If a Grant is subject to section 409A of\nthe Code, (I) distributions shall only be made in a manner and upon an event permitted under section 409A of the Code, (II)\npayments to be made upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a “separation from service” under section\n409A of the Code, (III) unless the Grant specifies otherwise, each installment payment shall be treated as a separate payment\nfor purposes of section 409A of the Code, and (IV) in no event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar\nyear in which a distribution is made except in accordance with section 409A of the Code.\n(iii)Any Grant that is subject to section 409A of the Code and that is to be distributed to a Key Employee (as defined\nbelow) upon separation from service shall be administered so that any distribution with respect to such Grant shall be\npostponed for six months following the date of the Participant’s separation from service, if required by section 409A of the\nCode. If a distribution is delayed pursuant to section 409A of the Code, the distribution shall be paid within 15 days after the\nend of the six-month period. If the Participant dies during such six-month period, any postponed amounts shall be paid within\n90 days of the Participant’s death. The determination of “Key Employees”, including the number and identity of persons\nconsidered Key Employees and the identification date, shall be made by the Committee or its delegate each year in accordance\nwith section 416(i) of the Code and the “specified employee” requirements of section 409A of the Code.\n(iv)Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Grant Agreement to the contrary, each Participant shall be solely\nresponsible for the tax consequences of Grants under the Plan, and in no event shall the Company have any responsibility or\nliability if a Grant does not meet any applicable requirements of section 409A of the Code. Although the Company intends to\nadminister the Plan to prevent taxation under section 409A of the Code, the Company does not represent or warrant that the\nPlan or any Grant complies with any provision of federal, state, local or other tax law.\n(d) Enforceability. The Plan shall be binding upon and enforceable against the Company and its successors and assigns.\n(e) Funding of the Plan; Limitation on Rights. This Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish\nany special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payment of any Grants under this Plan. Nothing\ncontained in the Plan and no action taken pursuant hereto shall create or be construed to create a fiduciary relationship between the\nCompany and any Participant or any other person. No Participant or any other person shall under any circumstances acquire any\nproperty interest in any specific assets of the Company. To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payment from the\nCompany hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.\n(f) Rights of Participants. Nothing in this Plan shall entitle any Employee, Non-Employee Director, Consultant or other\nperson to any claim or right to receive a Grant under this Plan. Neither this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed as\ngiving any individual any rights to be retained by or in the employment or service of the Employer.\n(g) No Fractional Shares.

The Committee shall determine whether cash, other awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional\nshares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.\n(h) Employees Subject to Taxation outside the United States. With respect to Participants who are subject to taxation in\ncountries other than the United States, the Committee may make Grants on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems\nappropriate to comply with the laws of the applicable countries, and the Committee may create such procedures, addenda and subplans\nand make such modifications as may be necessary or advisable to comply with such laws.\n(i) Company Policies; Clawback Rights.
