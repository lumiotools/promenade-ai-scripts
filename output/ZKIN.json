The year-over-\nyear increase was due to the increase in new product delivery volume, partially offset by the lower\naverage selling price due to the different product mix and pricing strategy changes between the two\nquarters.

(\"Geely Holding\"), a PRC limited liability company ultimately wholly-owned by Mr. Shufu Li and his associates, (ii) Volvo Cars (China) Investment Co., Ltd. (\"VCI\"), a wholly-owned PRC subsidiary of Volvo Car AB (XSTO: VOLCAR B) (\"Volvo\"), which itself is Geely Holding's indirect, non-wholly-owned subsidiary in Sweden, (iii) Ningbo Geely Automobile Industry Co., Ltd (\"Ningbo Geely\"), a wholly-owned PRC subsidiary of Geely Automobile Holdings Limited (HKEX: 0175) (\"Geely Auto\"), ZEEKR's controlling shareholder, and (iv) LYNK & CO Automotive Technology Co., Ltd. (\"LYNK & CO\"), a Chinese-foreign joint venture in China owned as to 50%, 20% and 30% respectively by Ningbo Geely, Geely Holding and VCI. LYNK & CO is principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of LYNK & CO brand vehicles and the after-sales parts.\n\nThe Strategic Integration Transactions include:\n\n  * **_LYNK & CO Acquisition. _**On November 14, 2024, Zhejiang ZEEKR Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd (\"Zhejiang ZEEKR\"), ZEEKR's indirect wholly-owned PRC subsidiary principally engaged in the sale of vehicles, entered into an equity transfer agreement (the \"LYNK & CO Equity Transfer Agreement\") with Geely Holding, VCI and LYNK & CO, pursuant to which Zhejiang ZEEKR will acquire a 20% interest in LYNK & CO from Geely Holding and a 30% interest in LYNK & CO from VCI (collectively, the \"Equity Transfer\") at a purchase price of RMB3.6 billion and RMB5.4 billion, respectively, in each case plus the interests accrued on such amount from the locked box date of September 30, 2024. The Equity Transfer is subject to terms and closing conditions as specified in the LYNK & CO Equity Transfer Agreement, including, among other things, the approval by the independent shareholders of Geely Auto and the approval by the shareholders of Volvo. ZEEKR expects to fund the acquisition using its own cash reserves and external financing. \n  * **_LYNK & CO Capital Injection. _**On November 14, 2024, Zhejiang ZEEKR entered into a subscription agreement (the \"LYNK & CO Capital Injection Agreement\") with LYNK & CO and Ningbo Geely, pursuant to which LYNK & CO will increase its registered capital and Zhejiang ZEEKR will subscribe for all such increased registered capital at a subscription price of RMB367,346,940 (the \"Capital Injection\"). After giving effect to this Capital Injection and the Equity Transfer, LYNK & CO will be owned as to 51% by Zhejiang ZEEKR and 49% by Ningbo Geely, respectively. Completion of the Capital Injection is subject to terms and closing conditions as specified in the LYNK & CO Capital Injection Agreement, including, among other things, the approval by the independent shareholders of Geely Auto and the completion of the Equity Transfer. ZEEKR expects to fund the Capital Injection from its own cash reserves.\n\n\n\nThe Strategic Integration Transactions are expected to close substantially concurrently, subject to the respective closing conditions set forth in the transaction documents. Upon completion, LYNK & CO will become ZEEKR's indirect non-wholly-owned subsidiary, and the financial results of LYNK & CO will be consolidated into the financial statements of ZEEKR.\n\nZEEKR's board of directors formed a committee of independent directors consisting of Mr. Miguel A. Lopez Ben, Mr. Stephen Brown Davis and Mr. Michael David Ricks (the \"Committee\"), to consider and evaluate the Strategic Integration Transactions. The Committee was advised by its independent financial advisor, Houlihan Lokey (China) Limited, which delivered a fairness opinion stating that, as of the date of the opinion, the consideration to be paid by ZEEKR in the Equity Transfer and the Capital Injection pursuant to the LYNK & CO Equity Transfer Agreement and the LYNK & CO Capital Injection Agreement is fair to the Company from a financial point of view. ZEEKR's board of directors, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Committee, approved the Strategic Integration Transactions.\n\nThe Company was notified that, also on November 14, 2024, a sale and purchase agreement was entered into between (i) Geely International (Hong Kong) Limited (\"GIHK\"), a limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong wholly owned by Geely Holding and (ii) Luckview Group Limited (\"Luckview\"), a limited liability company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Geely Auto, pursuant to which GIHK will sell and Luckview will purchase approximately 11.3% (on a fully-diluted basis when taking into account ZEEKR's ordinary shares reserved for its 2021 Share Incentive Plan) of ZEEKR's issued share capital for a consideration of US$806,100,000 (equivalent to approximately RMB5,835,116,070). Immediately after completion of this sale and purchase of ZEEKR shares, Geely Auto's shareholding in ZEEKR will increase to approximately 62.8% (on a fully-diluted basis when taking into account ZEEKR's ordinary shares reserved for its 2021 Share Incentive Plan).\n\n**About ZEEKR**\n\nZEEKR (NYSE: ZK) is a global premium electric mobility technology brand from Geely Holding Group.

Notably, the ZEEKR 7X's deliveries exceeded 20,000 units within 50 days since its launch, marking a robust achievement in the highly competitive mainstream SUV market. As we expand our product lineup and strengthen each model's position in its respective category, we are delivering ZEEKR's ultimate driving experience to more users, further cementing ZEEKR's industry leadership.\"\n\nMr. Jing Yuan, ZEEKR's chief financial officer, added, \"Our disciplined cost control measures, coupled with ongoing optimization of product structure, economies of scale, and technological innovation, drove a 30.7% year-over-year increase in revenue. Vehicle sales for the quarter grew by 42.0% and 7.2% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, respectively. Meanwhile, vehicle margin remained on an upward trajectory, rising to 15.7% in the third quarter of 2024, highlighting our consistent progress in profitability enhancement. Looking ahead, we will continue to consolidate resources, strengthen product capabilities, and expand our industry presence to propel our sustainable growth.\"\n\n**_Financial Results_**** _for the Third Quarter of 2024_**\n\n**Revenues**\n\n  * **Total revenues** were RMB18,358.0 million (US$2,616.0 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 30.7% from RMB14,044.6 million for the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 8.4% from RMB20,040.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. \n  * **Revenues from vehicle sales** were RMB14,401.3 million (US$2,052.2 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 42.0% from RMB10,143.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, and an increase of 7.2% from RMB13,438.2 million for the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was due to the increase in new product delivery volume, partially offset by the lower average selling price due to the different product mix and pricing strategy changes between the two quarters. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly attributable to the launch of the ZEEKR 7X new model in the third quarter of 2024 and the higher average selling price resulting from changes in product mix. \n  * **Revenues from sales of batteries and other components** were RMB3,245.3 million (US$462.5 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of 1.3% from RMB3,288.8 million for the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 38.8% from RMB5,299.2 million for the second quarter of 2024. The revenues from sales of batteries and other components remained relatively stable compared with the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly driven by lower sales volume of battery packs in the domestic market. \n  * **Revenues from research and development service and other services** were RMB711.4 million (US$101.4 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 16.2% from RMB612.1 million for the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 45.4% from RMB1,302.6 million for the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the increased sales of after-sales vehicle services. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to the decreased sales of research and development services to related parties.\n\n\n\n**Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin**\n\n  * **Cost of revenues** was RMB15,416.2 million (US$2,196.8 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 31.1% from RMB11,755.2 million for the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 7.1% from RMB16,590.2 million for the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to the increase in vehicle delivery volume and the quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in sales of batteries and other components. \n  * **Gross profit** was RMB2,941.8 million (US$419.2 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 28.5% from RMB2,289.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 14.7% from RMB3,449.8 million for the second quarter of 2024. \n  * **Gross margin** was 16.0% for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 16.3% for the third quarter of 2023 and 17.2% for the second quarter of 2024. The gross margin remained relatively stable compared with the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly attributable to the decreased margins on batteries and other components. \n  * **Vehicle margin** was 15.7% for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 18.1% for the third quarter of 2023 and 14.2% for the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributed to the lower average selling price of ZEEKR vehicles due to the different product mix and pricing strategy changes between the two quarters, partially offset by the procurement savings as the cost of auto parts and materials decreased. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to the change in product mix.\n\n\n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\n  * **Research and development expenses** were RMB1,966.2 million (US$280.2 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of 2.6% from RMB2,018.1 million for the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 25.1% from RMB2,623.5 million for the second quarter of 2024. Research and development expenses remained relatively stable compared with the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to a one-off, large quantity of share-based compensation expenses in the second quarter, conditioned on the Company's initial public offering. \n  * **Selling, general and administrative expenses** were RMB2,274.8 million (US$324.1 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 25.4% from RMB1,813.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 12.7% from RMB2,604.7 million for the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to increased expenses related to the expansion of offline channels in China and overseas as well as the marketing activities of the launch of new models.

By excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, the Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business and enhance the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss or other consolidated statements of comprehensive loss data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. The Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP Results\" set forth in this announcement.\n\n**_Exchange Rate Information_**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.
