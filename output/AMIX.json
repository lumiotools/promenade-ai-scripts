Announces Closing of $10.0 Million Underwritten Public Offering Including Partial Exercise of Over-Allotment Option\n\nNov 25, 2024\n\n**THE WOODLANDS, TX, Nov. 25, 2024 —**[Autonomix Medical, Inc.](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Y8uVZXCEoJ3zOxN-dzGZ5tPtZfZWC7OfCRgcZLD1ExdKAu33vLkOWQH4Zeg7IERtzc3WnS8C71vMttCp3MTo8iE2LODru5b_52j5-6-brLQ=) (NASDAQ: AMIX) (“Autonomix” or the “Company”), a medical device company focused on advancing precision nerve-targeted treatments, today announced the closing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of common stock units and pre-funded warrant units for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10.0 million, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, which amount includes the partial exercise of the over-allotment option granted to the underwriter.\n\nThe equity offering was comprised of 615,500 common stock units (which included 156,809 common stock units issued upon exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option) and 917,596 pre-funded warrant units, priced at a public offering price of $6.54 per common stock unit and $6.539 per pre-funded warrant unit. Each common stock unit and pre-funded warrant unit consisted of one share of common stock (or, in lieu of common stock, a pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.001) and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock that expires on the five-year anniversary of the date of issuance (a “Series A Warrant”). The exercise price for the Series A Warrant is $6.54 per share. The warrants issued in this transaction were fixed priced and do not contain any variable pricing features. The securities comprising the units were immediately separable and were issued separately.\n\nLadenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. acted as the sole bookrunning manager for the offering.\n\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund its clinical trial, for other research and development, for development of intellectual property, and for working capital.\n\nThe securities described above were offered by the Company pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-282940), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on November 22, 2024. The offering was made solely by means of a prospectus. A final prospectus relating to and describing the terms of the offering was filed with the SEC on November 25, 2024 and is available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Electronic copies of the final prospectus may be obtained from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., 640 Fifth Avenue, 4th Floor, New York, New York 10019, or by telephone at (212) 409-2000, or by email at [prospectus@ladenburg.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nM4hAngdPP6qLI_Je99lLQBWg_Q0jzstyeq1UiqijVY9BdmBgCiCBtqCpMlnlvtemv_euMCYZXzheb3zoAHQp17kc1TuQE2YcQALy6Lkv-M=).\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities nor will there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\n\n**About Autonomix Medical, Inc.**\n\nAutonomix is a medical device company focused on advancing innovative technologies to revolutionize how diseases involving the nervous system are diagnosed and treated. The Company’s first-in-class platform system technology includes a catheter-based microchip sensing array that may have the ability to detect and differentiate neural signals with approximately 3,000 times greater sensitivity than currently available technologies. We believe this will enable, for the first time ever, transvascular diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving the peripheral nervous system virtually anywhere in the body.\n\nWe are initially developing this technology for the treatment of pain, with initial trials focused on pancreatic cancer, a condition that causes debilitating pain and is without a reliable solution. Our technology constitutes a platform to address dozens of indications, including cardiology, hypertension and chronic pain management, across a wide disease spectrum. Our technology is investigational and has not yet been cleared for marketing in the United States.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nSome of the statements in this release are “forward-looking statements,” which involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, without limitation the use of the anticipated proceeds from the offering. Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “should,” “might,” “may,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “expects,” “plans,” and “proposes.”\n\nAlthough Autonomix believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider any cautionary statements and other disclosures, including the statements made under the heading “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on May 31, 2024, and from time to time, our other filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the document in which they are contained and Autonomix does not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements except as may be required by law.\n\n**Investor and Media Contact**\n\nJTC Team, LLC\n\nJenene Thomas\n\n908-824-0775\n\n[autonomix@jtcir.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dMn_Yw3Rikm3AtVE4ivnj_ttrcmeFDb-LmCt2J9DJ0E8iJ2IBSzNH0GCJIVszb7wDbwYw_2Fde1PjJtnDfJvvW7MRBI_uPKN5fk30umMq-k=)\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI4OTc1NCM2NjEwMjgyIzUwMDExOTk5Mg==) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ODY3OWMwYWMtOGM0Zi00ZDBmLWJhNWEtOTViYWMzYTRmYWZkLTUwMDExOTk5Mg==/tiny/Autonomix-Medical-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/8b0ba1bc-43b1-4445-b895-712da30f7df8/small/logo-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8b0ba1bc-43b1-4445-b895-712da30f7df8)\n"

Looking ahead, we are focused on the successful execution of our trial, with completion on enrollment expected by calendar year end. Based on the data demonstrated to date, we believe our technology has the potential to revolutionize the treatment paradigm for pancreatic cancer pain and bring an effective solution to additional high-value expansion opportunities. We are dedicated to building momentum and driving shareholder value in the near and long term,” commented Brad Hauser, Chief Executive Officer of Autonomix.\n\nThe Company’s first-in-class transvascular technology platform utilizes a catheter-based microchip sensing array antenna that has the ability to detect and differentiate neural signals with up to 3,000 times greater sensitivity than currently available technologies. Once target nerves are identified, Autonomix uses its proprietary radio frequency (“RF”) ablation technology to kill targeted nerves, enabling a precision guided sense, treat and verify approach to addressing a number of disease categories from chronic pain management to hypertension and cardiology. Current approaches, primarily relying on opioids or invasive ethanol injections, can provide only limited relief and may lead to risky side effects.\n\n**Expected Upcoming Milestones**\n\n  * Q4 CY2024: Complete enrollment in PoC human clinical study evaluating proprietary ablation technology for treatment of pancreatic cancer pain\n  * Q4 CY2024: Complete ablation device design intended for clinical use\n  * 1H 2025: Report topline data from PoC trial\n  * 2025: Initiate multi-centered pivotal trial in the United States\n  * 2H 2026: De novo submission\n  * 1H 2027: Potential FDA clearance\n\n\n\nFor more information about the Company’s technology, please visit [_autonomix.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-oKzWvjyt6dnAMrXK5ml8tNETVcExwZVf4hM0CnonpqSeuGrnWkaMkw6mWlZmxJuMnjLlaXJqi-IM2Q4MRcwzg==).\n\n**Summary of Financial Results for****Three and Six Months****Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred net losses of $2.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense was $1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $0.8 million for the same period in 2023.

The increase in research and development expenses during the current year was mainly attributed to our clinical trial and product development costs.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 the Company had cash of $5.2 million.\n\n**About Autonomix Medical, Inc.**\n\nAutonomix is a medical device company focused on advancing innovative technologies to revolutionize how diseases involving the nervous system are diagnosed and treated. The Company’s first-in-class platform system technology includes a catheter-based microchip sensing array that may have the ability to detect and differentiate neural signals with approximately 3,000 times greater sensitivity than currently available technologies. We believe this will enable, for the first time ever, transvascular diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving the peripheral nervous system virtually anywhere in the body.\n\nWe are initially developing this technology for the treatment of pain, with initial trials focused on pancreatic cancer, a condition that causes debilitating pain and is without a reliable solution. Our technology constitutes a platform to address dozens of indications, including cardiology, hypertension and chronic pain management, across a wide disease spectrum. Our technology is investigational and has not yet been cleared for marketing in the United States.\n\nFor more information, visit [_autonomix.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-oKzWvjyt6dnAMrXK5ml8qsF-EgFWW7Uzcjfq7PMlKkOcHVKK7IrqUjrLqP90nyL8Pu1RFxsfKJQMT8CXVq_7Q==) and connect with the Company on [_X_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qO2qdc7idtBCjGvZUUysbe0Z_63nA5gz6fphGicU5jDXO9s7xkBfdotPgcn1DdKFr94Bxhq03VfYTSey4KcZlg==), [_LinkedIn_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nKYFVlKCTROiqEO5d3vUg1kgq6Zl8E9FllF6qtm6zhmc2zOJV3jW8Swo62swPeHg1LOTKIH17LCy3Eh2O7s3u2r0rtVSmaBHzGVxVm3cxw-Gxe5W0NpP73PVZq8-LPDR), [_Instagram_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nFaGRpnnkrSxzO0PyX1xLj_Bj2IHAp3xvNtEZ8sb4Cp5WlXHKf7BueDJOzECdifyghTLoL0f80Rfu47oIhiqoGAsd2ycUyGi9ZmqTI2KXnM=) and [_Facebook_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CQtjsNUy9Iwi9T327TOQPdMDbl0dv9ohAWYIdm2DZLVBQQkfoen9RjA-HKOUZM_83O5_2LNSAjAB19ZSEy5Ma5MQ7SsdJeInMv8X2lQUclX8NAknaHxRamleCf1nrl3Q).\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nSome of the statements in this release are “forward-looking statements,” which involve risks and uncertainties.
