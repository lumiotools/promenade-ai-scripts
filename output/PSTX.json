Announces Agreement to be Acquired by Roche Holdings, Inc.\n\n[PDF Version](/node/9211/pdf)\n\n_Poseida stockholders to receive up to $13.00 per share in cash, comprised of $9.00 per share in cash at closing and a non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR) to receive up to an aggregate of $4.00 per share in cash; transaction represents total equity value of up to $1.5 billion_\n\n_Poseida to join the Roche Group and advance its innovative pipeline of non-viral, T SCM-rich CAR-T therapies and genetic medicines as part of Roche's Pharmaceuticals Division _\n\nSAN DIEGO, Nov. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PSTX) (\"Poseida\"), a clinical-stage allogeneic cell therapy and genetic medicines company advancing differentiated non-viral treatments for patients with cancer, autoimmune and rare diseases, today announced that it has entered into a merger agreement to be acquired by Roche Holdings, Inc. (\"Roche\") at a price of $9.00 per share in cash at closing, plus a non-tradeable CVR to receive certain contingent payments of up to an aggregate of $4.00 per share in cash upon achievement of specific milestones. This corresponds to a total equity value of approximately $1.5 billion on a fully diluted basis. The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by Poseida's Board of Directors, and Poseida's Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Poseida stockholders tender their shares in the tender offer.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Poseida Therapeutics, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1023018/Poseida_Therapeutics_Logo_v1.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1023018/Poseida_Therapeutics_Logo_v1.html)\n\nThe proposed acquisition will establish a new core capability for Roche in allogeneic cell therapy, with lead opportunities focused on CAR-T programs covered by the existing strategic collaboration between Poseida and Roche in hematologic malignancies. It will include CAR-T programs for solid tumors and autoimmune diseases, along with Poseida's genetic engineering platform and related preclinical medicines.\n\nPoseida has pioneered a proprietary technology platform that includes a full set of non-viral capabilities to design, develop and manufacture allogeneic, T stem cell memory cells (TSCM)-rich CAR-T therapies. TSCM cells are considered ideal for CAR-T therapy because they are long-lived, multi-potent and self-replicating, with the potential for an improved safety and efficacy profile. This may offer benefits compared to other approaches, which either use a different cell type or drive T cell differentiation (and therefore less stemness) as part of the process to manufacture the CAR-T cells.\n\n\"Poseida has demonstrated the unique ability of its proprietary non-viral technology platform to create allogeneic, TSCM-rich CAR-T therapies with the potential to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to this important class of medicines. Most recently, this was highlighted by the compelling interim clinical data for P-BCMA-ALLO1 in patients with multiple myeloma,\" said Kristin Yarema, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Poseida Therapeutics. \"We have worked closely with Roche through our collaboration focused on hematologic malignancies, and we are excited to join Roche to work as colleagues together across our pipeline and future programs. Roche's global capabilities in late-stage development and commercialization will enable patients worldwide to benefit from the transformative potential of allo CAR-T.\"\n\nPoseida and its employees will join the Roche Group as part of Roche's Pharmaceuticals Division.\n\n**Transaction Terms**\n\nUnder terms of the merger agreement, Roche will commence a tender offer to acquire all of Poseida's outstanding shares for a price of $9.00 per share in cash at closing, plus a non-tradeable CVR to receive up to an aggregate of $4.00 per share in cash, payable upon achievement of specified milestones. \n\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the tender of shares representing at least a majority of Poseida's outstanding shares (other than shares held by Poseida, Roche or any of their respective subsidiaries, and any dissenting shares), the completion of regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. Upon the successful completion of the tender offer, Roche will acquire all remaining Poseida shares that are not tendered into the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same price of $9.00 per share in cash at closing, plus a non-tradeable CVR to receive up to an aggregate of $4.00 per share in cash, payable upon achievement of specified milestones.\n\nThe closing of the transaction is currently expected to take place in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**Advisors** Centerview Partners LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Poseida and Cooley LLP is serving as legal counsel. Citi is acting as financial advisor to Roche and Sidley Austin LLP is acting as legal counsel to Roche.\n\n**About Poseida Therapeutics, Inc.**\n\nPoseida is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing differentiated allogeneic cell therapies and genetic medicines with the capacity to cure.

(Nasdaq: PSTX), a clinical-stage allogeneic cell therapy and genetic medicines company advancing differentiated non-viral treatments for patients with cancer, autoimmune and rare diseases, today announced plans to share progress across its clinical- and earlier-stage pipeline of differentiated T stem cell memory cells (TSCM)-rich allogeneic CAR-T therapies in oncology and autoimmune diseases during a virtual R&D Day to be held today at 10:00am ET / 7:00am PT.\n\n[ ![\\(PRNewsfoto/Poseida Therapeutics, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1023018/Poseida_Therapeutics_Logo_v1.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1023018/Poseida_Therapeutics_Logo_v1.html)\n\n\"We believe Poseida is well positioned to be a cell therapy leader based on the unique capabilities of our proprietary non-viral technology platform and our allogeneic TSCM-rich CAR-T approach,\" said Kristin Yarema, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Poseida Therapeutics. \"We are organizing our pipeline around three pillars – hematologic malignancies, solid tumors and autoimmune diseases – with multiple candidates in each that give us a wide range of opportunities. In the emerging field of cell therapy for autoimmune diseases, we are optimistic that our platform can build upon the early success seen with autologous CAR-T by offering an off-the-shelf option that would expand accessibility and address the potential drivers of relapse with more complete B cell depletion.\"\n\n\"Building on the advantages of our non-viral allogeneic TSCM-rich approach, we are implementing several advanced technologies aimed at bringing the benefits of CAR-T therapy to patients with solid tumors,\" said Devon J. Shedlock, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Cell Therapy at Poseida Therapeutics. \"This includes our collaboration with Astellas, which brings together the unique technologies from both companies to create a new class of CAR-T, _convertible_ CARs®, which employs multi-antigen targeting and other enhancements to improve CAR-T potency and persistence.\"\n\nThe event will feature presentations by members of Poseida's management team and will include a fireside chat with Peter Sandor, M.D., EVP and Head of Corporate Strategy at Astellas Pharma, that will cover the [research collaboration and license agreement](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302934-1&h=3438118041&u=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.poseida.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fastellas-and-poseida-therapeutics-enter-research-collaboration&a=research+collaboration+and+license+agreement) between Xyphos Biosciences, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of Astellas, \"Xyphos\") and Poseida to develop novel _convertible_ CAR® programs by combining the innovative cell therapy platforms from each of the companies. Poseida management will participate in a Q&A session at the end of the program.\n\n**Cell therapy technology platform:** Poseida has built a full set of non-viral capabilities to design and develop allogeneic, T _S_ CM-rich CAR-T therapies. T _S_ CM cells are considered ideal for CAR-T therapy because they are long-lived, multi-potent and self-replicating, with the potential for an improved safety and efficacy profile. This compares to other approaches, which either use a different cell type or drive T cell differentiation (and therefore less stemness) as part of the process to manufacture the CAR-T cells. The key elements of Poseida's approach include:\n\n  * **Non-viral, transposon-based gene insertion system** preferentially integrates genes into naïve and TSCM cells, with a high cargo capacity that allows for adding multiple genes to enhance functionality and add safety features\n  * **Cas-CLOVER gene editing system** preserves the TSCM cell type and operates effectively in resting T cells. It offers approximately 25-times greater fidelity than CRISPR-Cas9, supporting improved safety and quality\n  * **Wholly-owned, onsite GMP manufacturing facility** positioned to serve discovery through commercial needs across the Company's pipeline. The Company's Booster Molecule has enabled a scalable, lower cost manufacturing approach with the proven ability to generate cell yield up to over 100 doses per batch\n\n\n\n**Emerging leadership in allogeneic CAR-T for hematologic malignancies:** Poseida will provide an overview of recently reported interim Phase 1 results for P-BCMA-ALLO1, its lead CAR-T program targeting BCMA for the treatment of multiple myeloma. New preclinical data suggest that P-BCMA-ALLO1 effectively targets mutations that are known to arise in patients with relapse after prior anti-BCMA therapies. P-BCMA-ALLO1 is part of Poseida's collaboration with Roche and is currently enrolling a Phase 1b dose expansion study, which will be outlined in the presentation. In addition, the Company will highlight its emerging pipeline programs for hematologic malignancies:\n\n  * **P-CD19CD20-ALLO1** is the Company's first dual CAR-T program targeting CD19 and CD20 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies in collaboration with Roche. New preclinical data demonstrate that P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 delivers high in vitro potency and strong in vivo antitumor activity for either CD19 or CD20 single-positive target cells, as well as double-positive targets. A Phase 1 clinical trial is enrolling patients with selected B-cell malignancies, with initial clinical data anticipated in 2025. Additional information about the trial is available at [www.clinicaltrials.gov](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302934-1&h=1960901980&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4295512-1%26h%3D2277676248%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.clinicaltrials.gov%252F%26a%3Dwww.clinicaltrials.gov&a=www.clinicaltrials.gov) using identifier: NCT06014762.\n    * Beyond hematologic malignancies, preclinical data also demonstrate robust in vitro activity against patient-derived B cells across multiple autoimmune diseases\n  * **P-CD70-ALLO1** is a preclinical program targeting CD70 for the treatment of diseases including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). New preclinical data demonstrate P-CD70-ALLO1's robust anti-AML effect, with no toxicity to hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, there is a growing body of clinical and preclinical evidence that targeting CD70 with cell therapy may be an effective treatment for solid tumors. Roche has an option to add this as a potential new program to the collaboration\n\n\n\n**Expanding allogeneic T****SCM****-rich CAR-T to autoimmune disease:** Poseida's cell therapy technology platform has the potential to create CAR-T therapies designed to address the challenges with existing emerging approaches to applying cell therapy to autoimmune disease, including autologous CAR-T, in vivo CAR-T and T cell engagers. The Company's lead program for autoimmune disease is P-BCMACD19-ALLO1, a dual CAR-T targeting BCMA and CD19. New preclinical data demonstrate P-BCMACD19-ALLO1's potential in both autoimmune disease and oncology:\n\n  * Demonstrated robust in vitro killing of patient-derived B cells across multiple autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS), which collectively affect more than 5 million people in the U.S.\n  * Achieved dose-dependent depletion of primary human B cells in a humanized mouse model generated with human CD34+ cells\n  * Effectively eliminated primary human CD81+CD19+ multiple myeloma progenitor cells from patient bone marrow samples, addressing cells associated with relapse where BCMA-only targeted therapies were ineffective\n  * Demonstrated ability of P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 and P-BCMA-ALLO1 to kill tumor cells expressing known mutant forms of BCMA, which are linked to relapse in patients treated with autologous CAR-T and bispecific T cell engager therapies directed at BCMA\n\n\n\nPoseida is conducting IND-enabling studies for P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 and plans to file one or more INDs for an autoimmune disease indication with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\n**Addressing historical barriers for CAR-T in solid tumors through a broad array of bold, innovative technologies enabled by the Company's platform:** There are currently no CAR-T therapies approved for solid tumors, with several key factors believed to be roadblocks: 1) antigen heterogeneity; 2) differing lymphodepletion needs compared to hematologic malignancies to enable CAR-T cell engraftment, tracking, and infiltration; 3) on-target off-tumor toxicity; and 4) hostile tumor microenvironment. Poseida is approaching these challenges with a suite of technologies across multiple solid tumor programs:\n\n  * **P-MUC1C-ALLO1** is Poseida's lead solid tumor CAR-T program targeting MUC1-C, a membrane protein overexpressed in many epithelial cancers. A Phase 1 clinical trial is enrolling patients with treatment-resistant breast, ovarian, colorectal and other solid tumors, with ongoing exploration of P-MUC1C-ALLO1 dosing and lymphodepletion regimens. A clinical data update is planned for the European Society for Medical Oncology Immuno-Oncology Congress 2024 (ESMO-IO) taking place in Geneva December 11-13, 2024. A patient case study from the Phase 1 trial demonstrated a 42% decrease in paraesophageal lymph node size with prolonged stable disease for nearly a year in a heavily pretreated appendiceal carcinoma patient. New preclinical data suggest adding low-dose methotrexate to standard lymphodepletion may enhance CAR-T expansion and persistence\n  * **P-PSMA-ALLO1** is a preclinical program targeting PSMA for prostate cancer. In preclinical models, P-PSMA-ALLO1's dual CAR format showed superior in vivo anti-tumor activity and cytotoxicity compared to single and tandem binder CAR-Ts\n  * Poseida and Xyphos are developing **allogeneic** _**convertible**_**CARs ® for solid tumors**, combining Poseida's allogeneic CAR-TSCM platform with Xyphos' ACCEL™ technology to create controlled, long lasting, and highly active CAR-T therapies. New preclinical data shows positive results for an allogeneic _convertible_ CAR-TSCM targeting universal inert natural killer group 2 member D receptor (iNKG2D), paired with a solid tumor antigen-targeting MicAbody™. Poseida and Xyphos are working to optimize this _convertible_ CAR® and MicAbody™ pairing, and other platform technologies designed to maximize potency and persistence\n  * Poseida will highlight its **allogeneic CAR-TCR-T cells** to address antigen heterogeneity in solid tumors. The Company recently presented new preclinical data demonstrating enhanced potency to better target solid tumors at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 39th Annual Meeting. Preclinical data highlight the potential of a combination of CAR-TCR-T cell treatment followed by a T cell engager (TCE). In this model, MUC1C-CAR and NY-ESO-1-TCR T cells effectively controlled a primary tumor (MUC1C+/NY-ESO-1+/CD70-), and later were reactivated and re-directed by a CD70 TCE to control challenge by a secondary tumor (MUC1C-/NY-ESO-1-/CD70+)\n\n\n\n**In-house manufacturing to support Poseida's broad cell therapy pipeline:** the Company will highlight the capabilities of its GMP facility and team, including:\n\n  * New data demonstrated high-purity apheresis across different healthy donors, with consistency in CAR-T manufacturing (cellular expansion, gene editing, final phenotype) across collections from the same donor\n  * Future manufacturing platform enhancement opportunities including AI-assisted donor screening to improve efficiency; improving electroporation unit operations to improve gene editing efficiency and subsequent cell health; and leveraging dynamic bioreactor environments to increase yields\n\n\n\n**Video Webcast and Replay** This virtual event and access to the live webcast is available through the following registration link: [https://wsw.com/webcast/cc/pstx7/1467684](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302934-1&h=1238578411&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwsw.com%2Fwebcast%2Fcc%2Fpstx7%2F1467684&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwsw.com%2Fwebcast%2Fcc%2Fpstx7%2F1467684).\n\nRegistration for this virtual event and access to a replay of the live webcast will be available on the Investors & Media section of [www.poseida.com](http://www.poseida.com).
