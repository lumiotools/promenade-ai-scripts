(“HTI”) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe statements in this presentation that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results or events to be materially different. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements\nregarding stockholder liquidity and investment value and returns. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “estimates,” “projects,” “plans,” “intends,”\n“may,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these\nidentifying words. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including those set forth in the section\ntitled Risk Factors of HTI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024, as amended by the Form 10-K/A\nfiled on March 22, 2024, and in the section titled Risk Factors of HTI’s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and all other filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after that date, as such risks, uncertainties and other important factors may be updated from time to time in\nHTI’s subsequent reports. Please see slides 15 and 16 for further information. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and\nHTI undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or\nchanges to future operating results, unless required to do so by law.\nThis presentation includes estimated projections of future operating results. These projections were not prepared in accordance with published guidelines of the\nSEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial projections. This\ninformation is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results; the projections were prepared in good faith by\nmanagement and are based on numerous assumptions that may prove to be wrong. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the projections to\nnot be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the Company and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors of\nHTI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024, as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed on March 22,\n2024, and in the section titled Risk Factors of HTI’s subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and all other filings with the SEC after that date. The\nprojections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those\ncontained in the estimates. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates will be realized.\n14\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this presentation are “forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended),\nwhich reflect the expectations of the Company regarding future events. The forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors\nthat could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not\nlimited to, market and other expectations, objectives, and intentions, as well as any other statements that are not historical facts.\nOur potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section titled “Item 1A-Risk Factors” disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024, as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed on March 22, 2024, and all other filings with the SEC after that date. We\ndisclaim any obligation to update and revise statements contained in these materials to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or\nchanges to future operating results over time, unless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties relating to us, although not all risks and\nuncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:\n• Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market.\n• Our property portfolio has a high concentration of properties located in Florida and Pennsylvania. Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles\nand risks inherent to those states.\n• We have not paid our distributions on our common stock in cash since 2020, and there can be no assurance we will pay distributions on our common stock in\ncash in the future.\n• Inflation will have an adverse effect on our investments and results of operations.\n• The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure\ncould result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.\n• If a tenant or lease guarantor declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases.\n• We assume additional operating risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability because we depend on eligible independent contractors to manage\nsome of our facilities.\n• Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of co-venturers and\ndisputes between us and our co-venturers.\n• We may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire.\n• Our level of indebtedness may increase our business risks.\n• Our financing arrangements have restrictive covenants, which may limit our ability to pursue strategic alternatives and react to changes in our business and\nindustry or pay dividends.\n• We depend on our Advisor and Property Manager to provide us with executive officers, key personnel and all services required for us to conduct our operations\nand our operating performance may be impacted by any adverse changes in the financial health or reputation of our Advisor and Property Manager.\n• All of our executive officers, some of our directors and the key real estate and other professionals assembled by our Advisor and Property Manager face conflicts\nof interest related to their positions or interests in entities related to AR Global, which could hinder our ability to implement our business strategy.\n15\nForward-Looking Statements\n(Continued)\n• We may terminate our advisory agreement in only limited circumstances, which may require payment of a termination fee.\n• The Estimated Per-Share NAV of our common stock is based upon subjective judgments, assumptions and opinions about future events, and may not reflect the\namount that our stockholders might receive for their shares.\n• Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may discourage a third-party from acquiring us in\na manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders.\n• The share ownership restrictions for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in shares of our stock and restrict our\nbusiness combination opportunities.\n• Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax.\n• Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\n16\nAppendix: Financial Definitions\n17\nAppendix: Financial Definitions\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including funds from operations (“FFO”), adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”), Earnings\nbefore Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”),\nnet operating income (“NOI”), and cash net operating income (“Cash NOI”).\nWhile NOI and Cash NOI are property-level measures, FFO and AFFO is based on total Company performance and therefore reflects the impact of other items not\nspecifically associated with NOI and Cash NOI, such as interest expense, general and administrative expenses and operating fees to related parties. Additionally, NOI\nand FFO, as defined herein, do not reflect an adjustment for straight-line rent but AFFO does include this adjustment. A description of these non-GAAP measures and\nreconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, is provided below.\nThese non-GAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance, or any\nother performance measure derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and it should not be construed as an inference\nthat our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measure, which is net income, are provided below.\nPrior to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we presented another non-GAAP metric in place of AFFO, Modified Funds From Operations (“MFFO”). Historically, we\ncalculated MFFO as FFO as defined by NAREIT adjusted for (i) acquisition and transaction related costs, (ii) amortization of market-lease intangible assets and\nliabilities, (iii) adjustments for straight-line rent, (iv) mark-to-market gains and losses from our non-designated derivatives, (v) net amortization of our mortgage\ndiscounts and premiums, (vi) valuation reserves against our deferred tax assets and (vii) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities.\nWe believe that AFFO is a more meaningful non-GAAP metric to assess our operating performance than MFFO, and as such we intend to present AFFO for each\nreporting period beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and each comparable period thereafter.\nCaution on the Use of Non-GAAP Measures\nFFO, AFFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, and Cash NOI should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in\ncalculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under\nGAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures.\nOther REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT (as defined below) definition (as we do), or may interpret the current NAREIT definition\ndifferently than we do, or may calculate FFO or AFFO differently than we do. Consequently, our presentation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly-titled measures presented by other REITs.\nWe consider FFO and AFFO useful indicators of our performance. Because FFO and AFFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real\nestate assets and gain or loss from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost\naccounting and useful-life estimates), FFO and AFFO presentations facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs in our\npeer group.\n18\nAppendix: Financial Definitions\nCaution on the Use of Non-GAAP Measures (continued)\nAs a result, we believe that the use of FFO, AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our operating\nperformance including relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and\ninvesting activities. However, FFO and AFFO are not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions.\nInvestors are cautioned that FFO and AFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as they\nexclude certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of\nintangibles, which implies that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real-estate values historically rise and fall\nwith market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical\naccounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting\nfor real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed as any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation\nfound in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, which exclude the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among\nother things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and, when compared year-over-year, reflects the\nimpact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not\nbe immediately apparent from net income.\nFunds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\n(“NAREIT”), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the\noperating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White\nPaper approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the “White Paper”). NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss\n(computed in accordance with GAAP), adjusted for (i) real estate-related depreciation and amortization, (ii) impairment charges on depreciable real property,\n(iii) gains or losses from sales of depreciable real property and (iv) similar adjustments for non-controlling interests and unconsolidated entities. Our FFO\ncalculation complies with NAREIT’s definition.\n19\nAppendix: Financial Definitions\nFunds from Operations (continued)\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line\namortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values\nhistorically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for\na REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of\nGAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the\ncomparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate\nrelated depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and,\nwhen compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative\nexpenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations\nWe also believe that AFFO is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP measure of our operating results. We calculate AFFO by further adjusting FFO to reflect\nthe performance of our portfolio for items we believe are not directly attributable to our operations. We believe that AFFO is a beneficial indicator of our\nongoing portfolio performance and isolates the financial results of our operations. Our adjustments to FFO to arrive at AFFO include removing the impacts of\n(i) acquisition and transaction related costs, (ii) amortization of market-lease intangible assets and liabilities, (iii) adjustments for straight-line rent, (iv)\ntermination fees to related parties (v) equity-based compensation expense, (vi) depreciation and amortization related to non-real estate related assets, (vii)\nmark-to-market gains and losses from our non-designated derivatives, (viii) non-cash components of interest expense and (ix) similar adjustments for non-\ncontrolling interests and unconsolidated entities. We believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the REIT industry and\nis useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies.\nUnder GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income. In\naddition, as discussed above, we view gain and loss from fair value adjustments as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized and not\nreflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. Excluding income and expense items detailed\nabove from our calculation of AFFO provides information consistent with management’s analysis of our operating performance. Additionally, fair value\nadjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from\noperational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance. By excluding such\nchanges that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gain or loss, we believe AFFO provides useful supplemental information. By providing AFFO, we believe\nwe are presenting useful information that can be used to, among other things, assess our performance without the impact of transactions or other items that are\nnot related to our portfolio of properties. AFFO presented by us may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs that define AFFO differently.\nFurthermore, we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, AFFO should be examined in conjunction with net income\n(loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP as presented in our consolidated financial statements. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net\nincome (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or ability to make distributions.\n20\nAppendix: Financial Definitions\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization\nWe believe that EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is an appropriate measure of our ability to incur and\nservice debt. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net\nincome as an indicator of our operating activities. Other REITs may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and our calculation should not be compared to that\nof other REITs.\nAdjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for acquisition, transaction\nrelated, termination fees to related parties, and other non-cash items including Equity-based compensation, Impairment charges, Gains and losses on sale of\nreal estate investments, and Gains and losses on derivative investments is an appropriate measure of our ability to incur and service debt.\nAll paid and accrued acquisition, transaction and other costs (including prepayment penalties for debt extinguishments) and certain other expenses, including\nexpenses related to our Internalization (including termination fees to related parties), negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which\nexpenses are incurred or properties are acquired and will also have negative effects on returns to investors, but are not reflective of on-going performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net\nincome as an indicator of our operating activities. Other REITs may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and our calculation should not be compared to that\nof other REITs.\nNet Operating Income\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”) is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to total revenues from tenants, less property operating costs. The Company evaluates\nthe performance of the combined properties in each segment based NOI. As such, this excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial\nstatements in calculating net loss. The Company uses NOI to assess and compare property level performance and to make decisions concerning the operation\nof the properties. The Company believes that NOI is useful as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on\noperations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating expenses and acquisition activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not\nimmediately apparent from net loss.\nNOI excludes certain components from net loss in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property’s results of operations. For example,\ninterest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level. In addition, depreciation\nand amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by the\nCompany may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define it differently.\nWe believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented\nin our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash\nflows as a measure of our liquidity.\n21\nAppendix: Financial Definitions\nCash Net Operating Income\nCash Net Operating Income (“Cash NOI”) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is intended to reflect the performance of our properties. We define Cash NOI\nas NOI (which is separately defined herein) excluding net amortization of above/below market lease and lease intangibles and straight-line rent adjustments\nthat are included in GAAP Revenue from tenants and Property operating and maintenance. We believe that Cash NOI is a helpful measure that both investors\nand management can use to evaluate the current financial performance of our properties and it allows for comparison of our operating performance between\nperiods and to other REITs. Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flows\nas a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund all needs. The method by which we calculate and present Cash NOI may not be directly comparable to the way\nother REITs calculate and present Cash NOI.\nCash Paid for Interest\nCash Paid for Interest is calculated based on Interest expense net of the non-cash portion of interest expense and amortization of mortgage discounts and\npremiums. Management believes that Cash Paid for Interest provides useful information to investors to assess our overall solvency and financial flexibility.\nCash Paid for Interest should not be considered as an alternative to Interest expense as determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial\nmeasures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAnnualized Straight-Line Base Rent: Represents the total contractual base rents on a straight-line basis to be received throughout the duration of the lease\ncurrently in place expressed as a per annum value. Includes adjustments for non-cash portions of rent.\nCap Rate: Capitalization rate is a rate of return on a real estate investment property based on the expected, annualized straight-lined rental income that the\nproperty will generate under its existing lease during its first year of ownership. Capitalization rate is calculated by dividing the annualized straight-lined rental\nincome the property will generate (before debt service and depreciation and after fixed costs and variable costs) by the purchase price of the property. The\nweighted average capitalization rate is based upon square feet.\nCash Rent: Represents total of all contractual rents on a cash basis due from tenants as stipulated in the originally executed lease agreements at inception or\nany lease amendments thereafter.\nEconomic Interest Rate: Includes the economic impact of all hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2024, HTI had a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% on\nits total borrowings, which does not include the impact of non-designated derivatives.\nLease Renewal Rental Spread: Percentage change from prior lease annualized straight-line rent to renewal lease annualized straight-line rent.\n22\nAppendix: Financial Definitions\nLeasing Pipeline: Includes (i) all leases fully executed by both parties as of June 30, 2024, where Tenant has yet to take possession of the space as of June 30,\n2024 (ii) all leases fully executed by both parties as of August 15, 2024, but after June 30, 2024, and (iii) all leases under negotiation with an executed LOI by\nboth parties as of August 15, 2024. This represents three LOIs totaling 14,619 square feet and ten fully executed leases totaling 34,495 square feet. There can be\nno assurance that the LOIs will lead to definitive leases or will commence on their current terms, or at all. Leasing Pipeline should not be considered an\nindication of future performance.\nNet Debt: Total gross debt of $1.2 billion less cash and cash equivalents of $29.5 million as of June 30, 2024.\nNet Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDA: Net Debt as of June 30, 2024, divided by Annualized adjusted EBITDA (annualized based on Adjusted EBITDA\nfor the quarter ended June30, 2024multiplied by four).\nNet Leverage: Equal to “Net Debt” as defined above divided by the total real estate investments, at cost of $2.6 billion net of gross market lease intangibles of\n$21.0 million as of June 30, 2024.\nOccupancy: For MOB properties, occupancy represents percentage of leased square feet divided by the respective total rentable square feet as of the date or\nperiod end indicated. For SHOP properties, occupancy represents total units occupied divided by total units available as of the date or period end indicated.\nWeighted-Average Remaining Lease Term: Current portfolio calculated as of June 30, 2024. Weighted based on square feet.\n23\nAppendix: Non-GAAP Reconciliations\n24\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 30, December 31, September 30,\nAmounts in thousands, except per share data June 30, 2024 2024 2023 2023 June 30, 2023\nMOBs:\nRevenue from tenants $ 34,671 $ 34,599 $ 34,263 $ 33,657 $ 33,920\nProperty operating and maintenance (9,727) (9,700) (10,182) (9,379) (9,438)\nMOB Segment Net Operating Income(2) 24,944 24,899 24,082 24,278 24,482\nSHOPs:\nRevenue from tenants 54,146 53,700 52,517 52,029 52,184\nProperty operating and maintenance (45,278) (45,445) (45,832) (41,821) (44,131)\nSHOP Segment Net Operating Income(2) 8,868 8,255 6,685 10,208 8,053\nNet Operating income (NOI)(2) 33,812 33,154 30,767 34,486 32,535\nImpairment charges (2,409) (260) (4,676) - -\nOperating fees to related parties (6,424) (6,366) (6,374) (6,398) (6,369)\nTermination fees to related parties (98,241) - - - -\nAcquisition and transaction related (357) (142) (161) (173) (148)\nGeneral and administrative (4,668) (6,768) (4,823) (4,753) (4,331)\nDepreciation and amortization (21,928) (20,738) (21,353) (20,774) (20,568)\nGain (Loss) on sale of real estate investments (225) - 42 (173) (306)\nInterest expense (17,752) (16,383) (15,869) (15,720) (18,703)\nInterest and other income 457 72 157 258 313\nGain (Loss) on non-designated derivatives 882 1,951 (2,506) 406 286\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (65) (70) (60) (157) (41)\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests 452 (2) (22) (2) (22)\nAllocation for preferred stock (3,450) (3,450) (3,496) (3,450) (3,449)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders (in accordance with GAAP) $ (119,916) $ (19,002) $ (28,374) $ (16,450) $ (20,759)\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share:\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders — Basic and Diluted(1) $ (1.06) $ (0.17) $ (0.25) $ (0.15) $ (0.18)\nWeighted-average shares outstanding — Basic and Diluted(1) 113,185,753 113,148,558 113,189,829 113,117,691 113,086,488\n(1) Retroactively adjusted for the effects of the stock dividends.\n(2) See Appendix: Financial Definitions for a full description.\n25\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 30, December 31, September\nAmounts in thousands, except per share data June 30, 2024 2024 2023 30, 2023 June 30, 2023\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders (in accordance with GAAP) (119,916) (18,999) (28,269) (19,560) (20,759)\nDepreciation and amortization on real estate assets 20,903 19,748 20,574 19,960 19,915\nImpairment charges 2,409 260 4,676 - -\n(Gain)/loss on sale of real estate 225 - (42) 173 306\nAdjustments for non-controlling interests(1) (120) (100) (105) (97) (108)\nFFO (as defined by NAREIT) attributable to common stockholders(6) (96,499) 909 (3,166) 476 (646)\nAccretion of market lease and other intangibles, net (228) (460) (215) (204) (260)\nStraight-line rent adjustments (90) 188 (111) (352) (388)\nAcquisition and transaction related 357 142 161 173 148\nTermination fees to related parties(2) 98,241 - - - -\nEquity-based compensation 230 230 230 230 230\nDepreciations and amortization on non-real estate\nassets 1,025 990 778 814 655\nMark-to-market (gains)/losses from derivatives(3) 910 (178) 4,220 1,159 1,089\nNon-cash components of interest expense(4) 862 (374) (756) (768) 2,983\nAdjustments for non-controlling interests(1) (451) 2 22 2 19\nAdjusted funds from operations (AFFO) attributable to common\nstockholders(6) $ 4,357 $ 1,449 $ 1,163 $ 1,530 $ 3,828\nWeighted-average shares outstanding — Basic and Diluted(5) 113,185,753 113,148,558 113,189,829 113,117,691 113,086,488\nNet loss per share attributable to common shareholders $ (1.06) $ (0.17) $ (0.25) $ (0.17) $ (0.18)\n$\nAFFO per common share- Basic and Diluted(5) $ 0.038 $ 0.013 0.010 $ 0.014 $ 0.034\n(1) Represents the portion of the adjustments allocable to non-controlling interests\n(2) We provided notice to the Advisor in June 2024 of our intent to transition to self-management and executed the Internalization Agreement in August 2024.

Further, forward-looking statements\nspeak only as of the date they are made, and HTI undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changed assumptions,\nthe occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results, unless required to do so by law.\nThis presentation includes estimated projections of future operating results. These projections were not prepared in accordance with published guidelines of the\nSECor the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial projections. This\ninformation is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results; the projections were prepared in good faith by\nmanagement and are based on numerous assumptions that may prove to be wrong. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the projections to\nnot be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the Company and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors of\nHTI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024, as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed on March 22,\n2024, and in the section titled Risk Factors of HTI’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 filed on May10, 2024, and all\nother filings with the SEC after that date.

The reconciliation of net income to NOI for the applicable periods is set forth on page 18to this presentation.\n13\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this presentation are “forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended),\nwhich reflect the expectations of the Company regarding future events. The forward-looking statements involve a number of risks,uncertainties and other factors\nthat could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not\nlimited to, market and other expectations, objectives, and intentions, as well as any other statements that are not historical facts.\nOur potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section titled “Item 1A-Risk Factors” disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months\nended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 10, 2024,and all other filings with the SEC after that date. We disclaim any obligation to update and revise\nstatements contained in these materials to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time,\nunless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties relating to us, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results\nto differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:\n(cid:127) Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market.\n(cid:127) Our property portfolio has a high concentration of properties located in Florida and Pennsylvania. Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles\nand risks inherent to those states.\n(cid:127) We have not paid our distributions on our common stock in cash since 2020, and there can be no assurance we will pay distributions on our common stock in\ncash in the future.\n(cid:127) Inflation will have an adverse effect on our investments and results of operations.\n(cid:127) The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure\ncould result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.\n(cid:127) If a tenant or lease guarantor declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases.\n(cid:127) We assume additional operating risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability because we depend on eligible independent contractors to manage\nsome of our facilities.\n(cid:127) Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of co-venturers and\ndisputes between us and our co-venturers.\n(cid:127) We may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire.\n(cid:127) Our level of indebtedness may increase our business risks.\n(cid:127) Our financing arrangements have restrictive covenants, which may limit our ability to pursue strategic alternatives and react tochanges in our business and\nindustry or pay dividends.\n(cid:127) We depend on our Advisor and Property Manager to provide us with executive officers, key personnel and all services required for us to conduct our operations\nand our operating performance may be impacted by any adverse changes in the financial health or reputation of our Advisor andProperty Manager.\n(cid:127) All of our executive officers, some of our directors and the key real estate and other professionals assembled by our Advisor and Property Manager face conflicts\nof interest related to their positions or interests in entities related to AR Global, which could hinder our ability to implement our business strategy.\n14\nForward-Looking Statements\n(Continued)\n(cid:127) We may terminate our advisory agreement in only limited circumstances, which may require payment of a termination fee.\n(cid:127) The Estimated Per-Share NAV of our common stock is based upon subjective judgments, assumptions and opinions about future events, and may not reflect the\namount that our stockholders might receive for their shares.\n(cid:127) Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may discourage a third-party from acquiring us in\na manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders.\n(cid:127) The share ownership restrictions for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in shares of our stock and restrict our\nbusiness combination opportunities.\n(cid:127) Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax.\n(cid:127) Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\n15\nAppendix\n16\nDefinitions\nAnnualizedStraight-LineBaseRent:Representsthetotalcontractualbaserentsonastraight-linebasistobereceivedthroughoutthedurationofthe leasecurrentlyinplaceexpressed\nasaperannum value.

(“HTI”) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe statements in this presentation that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results or events to be materially different. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements\nregarding stockholder liquidity and investment value and returns. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “estimates,” “projects,” “plans,” “intends,”\n“may,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these\nidentifying words. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including those set forth in the section\ntitled Risk Factors of HTI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024, as amended by the Form 10-K/A\nfiled on March 22, 2024, and all other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after that date, as such risks, uncertainties and other\nimportant factors may be updated from time to time in HTI’s subsequent reports. Please see slides 14 and 15 for further information. Further, forward-looking\nstatements speak only as of the date they are made, and HTI undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changed\nassumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results, unless required to do so by law.\nThis presentation includes estimated projections of future operating results. These projections were not prepared in accordance with published guidelines of the\nSEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial projections. This\ninformation is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results; the projections were prepared in good faith by\nmanagement and are based on numerous assumptions that may prove to be wrong. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the projections to\nnot be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the Company and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors of\nHTI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed on March 15, 2024, as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed on March 22,\n2024, and all other filings with the SEC after that date. The projections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a\nresult, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the estimates. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates will be realized.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net operating income (“NOI”) and adjusted net operating income (“Adjusted\nNOI”). Adjusted NOI and NOI are non-GAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as measures\nof financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) and\nthey should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The reconciliation of net income to\nAdjusted NOI and NOI for the applicable periods is set forth on page 18 to this presentation.\n13\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this presentation are “forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended),\nwhich reflect the expectations of the Company regarding future events. The forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors\nthat could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not\nlimited to, market and other expectations, objectives, and intentions, as well as any other statements that are not historical facts.\nOur potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section titled “Item 1A-Risk Factors” disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024, as amended by the Form 10-K/A filed on March 22, 2024, and all other filings with the SEC after that\ndate. We disclaim any obligation to update and revise statements contained in these materials to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events\nor changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties relating to us, although not all risks\nand uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:\n• Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market.\n• Our property portfolio has a high concentration of properties located in Florida and Pennsylvania. Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles\nand risks inherent to those states.\n• We have not paid our distributions on our common stock in cash since 2020, and there can be no assurance we will pay distributions on our common stock in\ncash in the future.\n• Inflation will have an adverse effect on our investments and results of operations.\n• The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure\ncould result in the inability of our tenants to make rent payments to us.\n• If a tenant or lease guarantor declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases.\n• We assume additional operating risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability because we depend on eligible independent contractors to manage\nsome of our facilities.\n• Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of co-venturers and\ndisputes between us and our co-venturers.\n• We may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire.\n• Our level of indebtedness may increase our business risks.\n• Our financing arrangements have restrictive covenants, which may limit our ability to pursue strategic alternatives and react to changes in our business and\nindustry or pay dividends.\n• We depend on our Advisor and Property Manager to provide us with executive officers, key personnel and all services required for us to conduct our operations\nand our operating performance may be impacted by any adverse changes in the financial health or reputation of our Advisor and Property Manager.\n• All of our executive officers, some of our directors and the key real estate and other professionals assembled by our Advisor and Property Manager face conflicts\nof interest related to their positions or interests in entities related to AR Global, which could hinder our ability to implement our business strategy.\n14\nForward-Looking Statements\n(Continued)\n• We may terminate our advisory agreement in only limited circumstances, which may require payment of a termination fee.\n• The Estimated Per-Share NAV of our common stock is based upon subjective judgments, assumptions and opinions about future events, and may not reflect the\namount that our stockholders might receive for their shares.\n• Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may discourage a third-party from acquiring us in\na manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders.\n• The share ownership restrictions for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in shares of our stock and restrict our\nbusiness combination opportunities.\n• Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax.\n• Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\n15\nAppendix\n16\nDefinitions\nAdjusted NOI: Defined as NOI (below) exclusive of funding received through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"). During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, $4.5 million was received by our SHOP segment through the CARES Act. No funds were received through the CARES Act in the year ended December 31, 2023\nand no amounts are expected to be received.\nAnnualized Straight-Line Base Rent: Represents the total contractual base rents on a straight-line basis to be received throughout the duration of the lease currently in place expressed\nas a per annum value. Includes adjustments for non-cash portions of rent.\nCap Rate: Capitalization rate is a rate of return on a real estate investment property based on the expected, annualized straight-lined rental income that the property will generate under\nits existing lease during its first year of ownership. Capitalization rate is calculated by dividing the annualized straight-lined rental income the property will generate (before debt service\nand depreciation and after fixed costs and variable costs) by the purchase price of the property. The weighted average capitalization rate is based upon square feet.\nCash Rent: Represents total of all contractual rents on a cash basis due from tenants as stipulated in the originally executed lease agreements at inception or any lease amendments\nthereafter. We calculate “original Cash Rent collections” by comparing the total amount of rent collected during the period to the original Cash Rent due. Total rent collected during the\nperiod includes both original Cash Rent due and payments made by tenants pursuant to rent deferral agreements.\nEconomic Interest Rate: Includes the economic impact of all hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2023, HTI had a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% on its total borrowings,\nwhich does not include the impact of non-designated derivatives.\nLease Renewal Rental Spread: Percentage change from prior lease annualized SLR to renewal lease annualized SLR.\nLease Term Remaining: Current portfolio calculated from December 31, 2023. Weighted based on square feet.\nLeasing Pipeline: Includes (i) all leases fully executed by both parties as of February 1, 2024, but after December 31, 2023 and (ii) all leases under negotiation with an executed LOI by\nboth parties as of February 15, 2024. This represents three LOIs totaling 16,240 square feet and two fully executed leases totaling 10,371 square feet. There can be no assurance that the\nLOIs will lead to definitive leases or will commence on their current terms, or at all. Leasing Pipeline should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nNet Debt: Total gross debt of $1.2 billion less cash and cash equivalents of $46.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\nNet Leverage: Equal to “Net Debt” as defined above divided by the total real estate investments, at cost of $2.6 billion net of gross market lease intangibles of $23.5 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nNOI: Defined as a non-GAAP financial measure used by us to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate.

(“HTI”) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe statements in this presentation that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results or events to be materially different. Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements\nregarding stockholder liquidity and investment value and returns. The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “estimates,” “projects,” “plans,” “intends,”\n“may,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these\nidentifying words. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including those set forth in the section\ntitled Risk Factors of HTI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed on March 17, 2023 and all other filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) after that date, as such risks, uncertainties and other important factors may be updated from time to time in\nHTI’s subsequent reports. Please see slides 14 and 15 for further information. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and\nHTI undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or\nchanges to future operating results, unless required to do so by law.\nThis presentation includes estimated projections of future operating results. These projections were not prepared in accordance with published guidelines of the\nSEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial projections. This\ninformation is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results; the projections were prepared in good faith by\nmanagement and are based on numerous assumptions that may prove to be wrong. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the projections to\nnot be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the Company and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors of\nHTI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed on March 17, 2023 and all other filings with the SEC after that date. The\nprojections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those\ncontained in the estimates. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates will be realized.\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net operating income (“NOI”). NOI is a non-GAAP measure of our financial\nperformance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in\naccordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The\nreconciliation of net income to NOI for the applicable periods is set forth on page 18 to this presentation.\n13\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this presentation are “forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended),\nwhich reflect the expectations of the Company regarding future events. The forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors\nthat could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not\nlimited to, market and other expectations, objectives, and intentions, as well as any other statements that are not historical facts.\nOur potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section titled “Item 1A-Risk Factors” disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 17, 2023 and all other filings with the SEC after that date. We disclaim any obligation to update and revise\nstatements contained in these materials to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time,\nunless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties relating to us, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results\nto differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:\n• Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general.\n• Our property portfolio has a high concentration of properties located in Florida. Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles and risks inherent\nto those states.\n• Our loan agreement in connection with the Barclay’s MOB Loan requires us to maintain a minimum balance of cash and cash equivalents totaling $12.5 million,\nwhich may restrict our ability to use cash that would otherwise be available to us.\n• A reduction in our NOI can impact our ability to satisfy debt covenants and could adversely affect our business.\n• We are subject to risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, including negative\nimpacts on our tenants and operators and their respective businesses.\n• Inflation and continuing increases in the inflation rate will have an adverse effect on our investments and results of operations.\n• No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock and our shares are, and may continue to be, illiquid.\n• In owning properties we may experience, among other things, unforeseen costs associated with complying with laws and regulations and other costs, potential\ndifficulties selling properties and potential damages or losses resulting from climate change.\n• We focus on acquiring and owning a diversified portfolio of healthcare-related assets located in the United States and are subject to risks inherent in\nconcentrating investments in the healthcare industry.\n• The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and we, our tenants, and operators may be impacted by new or existing laws or regulations, or changes to these laws\nor regulations, such as the CARES Act and the auditing and reporting requirements instituted by the CARES Act.\n• Loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of tenants to make lease payments to us.\n• We depend on tenants for our rental revenue and, accordingly, our rental revenue depends upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Lease\nterminations, tenant default and bankruptcy have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our income and cash flow.\n• We assume additional operating risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability because we depend on eligible independent contractors to manage\nsome of our facilities.\n14\nForward-Looking Statements\n(Continued)\n• We have substantial indebtedness and may be unable to repay, refinance, restructure or extend our indebtedness as it becomes due.

There can be no assurance that the LOIs will lead to acquisitions on their current terms, or at\nall. Acquisition Pipeline should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nAnnualized Straight-Line Base Rent: Represents the total contractual base rents on a straight-line basis to be received throughout the duration of the lease currently in place expressed\nas a per annum value. Includes adjustments for non-cash portions of rent.\nCap Rate: Capitalization rate is a rate of return on a real estate investment property based on the expected, annualized straight-lined rental income that the property will generate under\nits existing lease during its first year of ownership. Capitalization rate is calculated by dividing the annualized straight-lined rental income the property will generate (before debt service\nand depreciation and after fixed costs and variable costs) by the purchase price of the property. The weighted average capitalization rate is based upon square feet.\nCash Rent: Represents total of all contractual rents on a cash basis due from tenants as stipulated in the originally executed lease agreements at inception or any lease amendments\nthereafter. We calculate “original Cash Rent collections” by comparing the total amount of rent collected during the period to the original Cash Rent due. Total rent collected during the\nperiod includes both original Cash Rent due and payments made by tenants pursuant to rent deferral agreements.\nEconomic Interest Rate: Includes the economic impact of all hedging instruments. As of September 30, 2023, HTI had a weighted average interest rate of 5.6% on its total borrowings,\nwhich does not include the impact of non-designated derivatives.\nLease Renewal Rental Spread: Percentage change from prior lease annualized SLR to renewal lease annualized SLR.\nLease Term Remaining: Current portfolio calculated from September 30, 2023. Weighted based on square feet.\nLeasing Pipeline: Includes (i) all leases fully executed by both parties as of November 1, 2023, but after September 30, 2023 and (ii) all leases under negotiation with an executed LOI\nby both parties as of November 1, 2023. This represents four LOIs totaling 10,922 square feet and one fully executed lease totaling 1,550 square feet. There can be no assurance that the\nLOIs will lead to definitive leases or will commence on their current terms, or at all. Leasing Pipeline should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nNet Debt: Total gross debt of $1.2 billion less cash and cash equivalents of $51.0 million as of September 30, 2023.\nNet Leverage: Equal to “Net Debt” as defined above divided by the carrying value of total assets of approximately $2.2 billion (which includes cash and cash equivalents) plus\naccumulated depreciation and amortization of $663.5 million as of September 30, 2023.\nNOI: Defined as a non-GAAP financial measure used by us to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate. NOI is equal to revenue from tenants, less property operating and\nmaintenance expenses. NOI excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net income (loss).\nOccupancy: For MOB properties, occupancy represents percentage of leased square feet divided by the respective total rentable square feet as of the date or period end indicated. For\nSHOP properties, occupancy represents total units occupied divided by total units available as of the date or period end indicated.\n17\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Metrics: NOI\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nSeniors Housing\nMedical Office — Operating\n(In thousands) Buildings Properties Consolidated\nRevenue from tenants $ 33,657 $ 52,029 $ 85,686\nProperty operating and maintenance (9,379) (44,947) (54,326)\nNOI $ 24, 278 $ 7,082 $ 31,360\nImpairment charges –\nOperating fees to related parties (6,397)\nAcquisition and transaction related (173)\nGeneral and administrative (4,753)\nDepreciation and amortization (20,776)\nInterest expense (15,720)\nInterest and other income 258\nLoss on sale of real estate investments (173)\nGain on non-designated derivatives 406\nIncome tax expense (157)\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests 14\nAllocation for preferred stock (3,450)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (19,561)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2022\nSeniors Housing\nMedical Office — Operating\n(In thousands) Buildings Properties Consolidated\nRevenue from tenants $ 33,185 $ 50,275 $ 83,460\nProperty operating and maintenance (9,377) (41,821) (51,198)\nNOI $ 23,808 $ 8,454 $ 32,262\nImpairment charges (8,949)\nOperating fees to related parties (6,333)\nAcquisition and transaction related (199)\nGeneral and administrative (4,471)\nDepreciation and amortization (20,854)\nInterest expense (13,284)\nInterest and other income 10\nGain/Loss on sale of real estate investments 194\nGain on non-designated derivatives 1,826\nIncome tax expense (77)\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests 22\nAllocation for preferred stock (3,450)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (23,303)\n18\n▪ For account information, including\nbalances and the status of submitted\npaperwork, please call us at\n(866) 902-0063\n▪ Financial Advisors may view client\naccounts at\nHealthcareTrustInc.com\nwww.computershare.com/advisorportal\n▪ Shareholders may access their accounts\nat www.computershare.com/hti\n19"

Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles and risks inherent\nto those states.\n• Our loan agreement in connection with the Barclay’s MOB Loan requires us to maintain a minimum balance of cash and cash equivalents totaling $12.5 million,\nwhich may restrict our ability to use cash that would otherwise be available to us.\n• A reduction in our NOI can impact our ability to satisfy debt covenants and could adversely affect our business.\n• We are subject to risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, including negative\nimpacts on our tenants and operators and their respective businesses.\n• Inflation and continuing increases in the inflation rate will have an adverse effect on our investments and results of operations.\n• No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock and our shares are, and may continue to be,illiquid.\n• In owning properties we may experience, among other things, unforeseen costs associated with complying with laws and regulationsand other costs, potential\ndifficulties selling properties and potential damages or losses resulting from climate change.\n• We focus on acquiring and owning a diversified portfolio of healthcare-related assets located in the United States and are subject to risks inherent in\nconcentrating investments in the healthcare industry.\n• The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and we, our tenants, and operators may be impacted by new or existing laws or regulations, or changes to these laws\nor regulations, such as the CARES Act and the auditing and reporting requirements instituted by the CARES Act.\n• Loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of tenants to make lease payments to us.\n• We depend on tenants for our rental revenue and, accordingly, our rental revenue depends upon the success and economic viabilityof our tenants. Lease\nterminations, tenant default and bankruptcy have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our income and cashflow.\n• We assume additional operating risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability because we depend on eligible independent contractors to manage\nsome of our facilities.\n14\nForward-Looking Statements\n(Continued)\n• We have substantial indebtedness and may be unable to repay, refinance, restructure or extend our indebtedness as it becomes due. Increases in interest rates could\nincrease the amount of our debt payments. We will likely incur additional indebtedness in the future.\n• We depend on our Advisor and our Property Manager to provide us with executive officers, key personnel and all services requiredfor us to conduct our operations\nand our operating performance may be impacted by an adverse changes in the financial health or reputation of our Advisor and ourProperty Manager.\n• All of our executive officers face conflicts of interest, such as conflicts created by the terms of our agreements with the Advisor and compensation payable\nthereunder, conflicts allocating investment opportunities to us, and conflicts in allocating their time and attention to our matters. Conflicts that arise may not be\nresolved in our favor and could result in actions that are adverse to us.\n• We have long-term agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates that may be terminated only in limited circumstances and may require us to pay a termination fee\nin some cases.\n• Estimated Per-Share NAV may not accurately reflect the value of our assets and may not represent what a stockholder may receive on a sale of the shares, what they\nmay receive upon a liquidation of our assets and distribution of the net proceeds or what a third party may pay to acquire us.\n• The stockholder rights plan adopted by our board of directors, our classified board and other aspects of our corporate structureand Maryland law may discourage a\nthird party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders.\n• Restrictions on share ownership contained in our charter may inhibit market activity in shares of our stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.\n• We may fail to continue to qualify as a REIT.\n15\nAppendix\n16\nDefinitions\nAnnualizedStraight-LineBaseRent:Representsthetotalcontractualbaserentsonastraight-linebasistobereceivedthroughoutthedurationoftheleasecurrentlyinplaceexpressed\nasaperannumvalue.Includesadjustmentsfornon-cashportionsofrent.\nCapRate:Capitalizationrateisarateofreturnonarealestateinvestmentpropertybasedontheexpected,annualizedstraight-linedrentalincomethatthepropertywillgenerateunder\nitsexistingleaseduringitsfirstyearofownership.Capitalizationrateiscalculatedbydividingtheannualizedstraight-linedrentalincomethepropertywillgenerate(beforedebtservice\nanddepreciationandafterfixedcostsandvariablecosts)bythepurchasepriceoftheproperty.Theweightedaveragecapitalizationrateisbaseduponsquarefeet.\nCash Rent: Represents total of all contractual rents on a cash basis due from tenants as stipulated in the originally executed lease agreements at inception or any lease amendments\nthereafter.Wecalculate“originalCashRentcollections”bycomparingthetotalamountofrentcollectedduringtheperiodtotheoriginalCashRentdue.Totalrentcollectedduringthe\nperiodincludesbothoriginalCashRentdueandpaymentsmadebytenantspursuanttorentdeferralagreements.\nLeaseTermRemaining:CurrentportfoliocalculatedfromJune30,2023.Weightedbasedonsquarefeet.\nLiquidity: As of June 30, 2023, HTI had $71.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $189.2million available for future borrowings under HTI's credit facility, of which $112.0\nmillion was available for general corporate purposes and acquisitions, with the remainder available to repay other existing debt obligations.

The\nprojections also reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual resultsmay differ materially from those\ncontained in the estimates. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates will be realized.\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net operating income (“NOI”). NOI is a non-GAAP measure of our financial\nperformance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in\naccordance with GAAP and itshould not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The\nreconciliation of net income to NOI for the applicable periods isset forth on page 18to this presentation.\n13\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this presentation are “forward-looking statements” (as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended),\nwhich reflect the expectations of the Company regarding future events. The forward-looking statements involve a number of risks,uncertainties and other factors\nthat could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not\nlimited to, market and other expectations, objectives, and intentions, as well as any other statements that are not historical facts.\nOur potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section titled “Item 1A-Risk Factors” disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on March 17, 2023 and all other filings with the SEC after that date. We disclaim any obligation to update and revise\nstatements contained in these materials to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time,\nunless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties relating to us, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results\nto differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements:\n• Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general.\n• Our property portfolio has a high concentration of properties located in Florida. Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles and risks inherent\nto those states.\n• Our loan agreement in connection with the CMBS financing requires us to maintain a minimum balance of cash and cash equivalents totaling $12.5 million,\nwhich may restrict our ability to use cash that would otherwise be available to us.\n• A reduction in our NOI can impact our ability to satisfy debt covenants and could adversely affect our business.\n• We are subject to risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, including negative\nimpacts on our tenants and operators and their respective businesses.\n• Inflation and continuing increases in the inflation rate will have an adverse effect on our investments and results of operations.\n• No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock and our shares are, and may continue to be,illiquid.\n• In owning properties we may experience, among other things, unforeseen costs associated with complying with laws and regulationsand other costs, potential\ndifficulties selling properties and potential damages or losses resulting from climate change.\n• We focus on acquiring and owning a diversified portfolio of healthcare-related assets located in the United States and are subject to risks inherent in\nconcentrating investments in the healthcare industry.\n• The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and we, our tenants, and operators may be impacted by new or existing laws or regulations, or changes to these laws\nor regulations, such as the CARES Act and the auditing and reporting requirements instituted by the CARES Act.\n• Loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of tenants to make lease payments to us.\n• We depend on tenants for our rental revenue and, accordingly, our rental revenue depends upon the success and economic viabilityof our tenants. Lease\nterminations, tenant default and bankruptcy have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our income and cashflow.\n• We assume additional operating risks and are subject to additional regulation and liability because we depend on eligible independent contractors to manage\nsome of our facilities.\n14\nForward-Looking Statements\n(Continued)\n• We have substantial indebtedness and may be unable to repay, refinance, restructure or extend our indebtedness as it becomes due. Increases in interest rates could\nincrease the amount of our debt payments. We will likely incur additional indebtedness in the future.\n• We depend on our Advisor and our Property Manager to provide us with executive officers, key personnel and all services requiredfor us to conduct our operations\nand our operating performance may be impacted by an adverse changes in the financial health or reputation of our Advisor and ourProperty Manager.\n• All of our executive officers face conflicts of interest, such as conflicts created by the terms of our agreements with the Advisor and compensation payable\nthereunder, conflicts allocating investment opportunities to us, and conflicts in allocating their time and attention to our matters. Conflicts that arise may not be\nresolved in our favor and could result in actions that are adverse to us.\n• We have long-term agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates that may be terminated only in limited circumstances and may require us to pay a termination fee\nin some cases.\n• Estimated Per-Share NAV may not accurately reflect the value of our assets and may not represent what a stockholder may receive on a sale of the shares, what they\nmay receive upon a liquidation of our assets and distribution of the net proceeds or what a third party may pay to acquire us.\n• The stockholder rights plan adopted by our board of directors, our classified board and other aspects of our corporate structureand Maryland law may discourage a\nthird party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders.\n• Restrictions on share ownership contained in our charter may inhibit market activity in shares of our stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.\n• We may fail to continue to qualify as a REIT.\n15\nAppendix\n16\nDefinitions\nAnnualizedStraight-LineBaseRent:Representsthetotalcontractualbaserentsonastraight-linebasistobereceivedthroughoutthedurationoftheleasecurrentlyinplaceexpressed\nasaperannumvalue.Includesadjustmentsfornon-cashportionsofrent.\nCapRate:Capitalizationrateisarateofreturnonarealestateinvestmentpropertybasedontheexpected,annualizedstraight-linedrentalincomethatthepropertywillgenerateunder\nitsexistingleaseduringitsfirstyearofownership.Capitalizationrateiscalculatedbydividingtheannualizedstraight-linedrentalincomethepropertywillgenerate(beforedebtservice\nanddepreciationandafterfixedcostsandvariablecosts)bythepurchasepriceoftheproperty.Theweightedaveragecapitalizationrateisbaseduponsquarefeet.\nCash Rent: Represents total of all contractual rents on a cash basis due from tenants as stipulated in the originally executed lease agreements at inception or any lease amendments\nthereafter.Wecalculate“originalCashRentcollections”bycomparingthetotalamountofrentcollectedduringtheperiodtotheoriginalCashRentdue.Totalrentcollectedduringthe\nperiodincludesbothoriginalCashRentdueandpaymentsmadebytenantspursuanttorentdeferralagreements.\nLeasingPipeline: Includes(i)allleasesfullyexecutedbybothpartiesasofMay15,2023,butafterMarch31,2023and(ii)allleasesundernegotiationwithanexecutedLOIbyboth\npartiesasofMay15,2023.ThisrepresentsfourLOIstotaling25,003squarefeetand11fullyexecutedleasestotaling39,197squarefeet.TherecanbenoassurancethattheLOIswill\nleadtodefinitiveleasesorwillcommenceontheircurrentterms,oratall.LeasingPipelineshouldnotbeconsideredanindicationoffutureperformance.\nLeaseTermRemaining:CurrentportfoliocalculatedfromMarch31,2023.Weightedbasedonsquarefeet.\nLiquidity:AsofMarch31,2023,HTIhad$35.8millionincashandcashequivalents,and$189.2millionavailableforfutureborrowingsunderHTI'screditfacility,ofwhich$112.0\nmillion was available for general corporate purposes and acquisitions, with the remainder available to repay other existing debt obligations.

Announces Completion of Management Internalization \n\n- _Completed Previously Announced Internalization of Management_ - _Rebranding to National Healthcare Properties, Inc._ - _Announces Strategic Initiatives for Future Growth_\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time\n\nNEW YORK--([BUSINESS WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Healthcare Trust, Inc. (Nasdaq: HTIA / HTIBP) (the “Company”) today announced the successful completion of its previously announced internalization of management, marking a pivotal moment in the Company’s evolution. This strategic move is expected to result in annual savings exceeding $25 million in general and administrative (G&A) expenses and enhance governance and shareholder alignment as the Company evaluates a potential public listing. \n\nAs part of this transformative process, the Company is also rebranding itself as National Healthcare Properties, Inc. to better reflect its strategic vision and continued commitment to excellence in the healthcare real estate sector. The Company believes this rebranding aligns with its goal to position itself for long-term growth and value creation for its shareholders. \n\nIn conjunction with the internalization and rebranding, the Company has executed a 4-for-1 reverse stock split to potentially enhance its stock’s marketability and liquidity. The reverse stock split is designed to better align the Company’s share price with industry peers and facilitate greater investor interest as National Healthcare Properties, Inc. prepares for future opportunities. \n\nTo further support its strategic initiatives, the Company has engaged BMO Capital Markets Corp. as its financial advisor to assist it in the evaluation of a potential public listing of its shares of common stock. \n\nThe Company will continue to be led by Michael Anderson, who has been appointed to the board of directors and remains as Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Lappetito, who continues as Chief Financial Officer. The Company believes that their strong leadership will guide National Healthcare Properties, Inc. through this exciting new chapter and ensure the organization is well-prepared to capitalize on growth opportunities within the healthcare real estate sector. \n\n“We are thrilled to announce the completion of our management internalization and the rebranding of our Company, National Healthcare Properties, Inc.,” said Michael Anderson. “This is a significant milestone that we believe enhances our operational efficiency, further aligns our governance structure with that of our publicly traded peers, and positions us for future growth. We look forward to working with BMO Capital Markets as we explore the potential for a public listing of our common stock and continue to build a robust portfolio of healthcare properties.” \n\n**About National Healthcare Properties, Inc.**\n\nNational Healthcare Properties, Inc.

(Nasdaq: HTIA / HTIBP) (“HTI”) announced today that, in anticipation of a potential future listing of HTI’s common stock on a national securities exchange, it has provided notice to Healthcare Trust Advisors, LLC (the “Advisor”), the external advisor to HTI, of its intent to transition to self-management and internalize management functions (the “Internalization”). The Company expects the Internalization to close no later than the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to negotiation and execution of definitive agreements. The Company believes that the consummation of the Internalization will be an important step in the Company’s ongoing evaluation of a potential listing of its common stock on a national securities exchange, which could occur, subject to market conditions, as early as 2025. \n\n“We are excited to embark on this next phase of our Company and believe this is a milestone event for HTI. We look forward to working with the Advisor to consummate this Internalization and better position ourselves for a potential listing, which we believe would provide HTI with access to additional capital and liquidity for our existing stockholders,” said Michael Anderson, Chief Executive Officer of HTI. \n\nThe Company intends to change its name to National Healthcare Properties, Inc. in connection with the anticipated Internalization. \n\nThere can be no assurance that the Internalization will close within the anticipated time frame or at all, or that the HTI will be able to list its shares of common stock on a national securities exchange. \n\n**Important Notice**\n\nThe statements in this press release that are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
