(“BriaCell”)\nThis presentation is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to\nbuy any securities of BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (the “Company”) nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale\nwould be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The Company makes certain filings with the\nCanadian securities regulatory authorities and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), all of which are available under our profiles on SEDAR at\nwww.sedar.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov. For a more complete discussion of the risk factors affecting our business, please refer to these filings.\nOur public communications, including this presentation, and SEDAR and SEC filings, may contain statements related to future, not past, events. These forward-\nlooking statements are based upon current beliefs and expectations of the Company’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These\nforward-looking statements often, but not always, may be identified by the use of words such as “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “expects,”\n“plans,” “projects,” “intends,” “predicts,” “may,” “could,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “approximately,” “potential” or, in each case, their negative or other variations\nthereon or comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or\nuncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements appear in a number of places throughout this presentation and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs,\nprojections, outlook, analyses or current expectations concerning, among other things, our reliance on third parties to carry out a large portion of our business;\nthe possibility that pre-clinical and initial clinical trials will not necessarily be predictive of future results; our ability to obtain additional capital to continue our\noperations; our reliance on key personal; our success in completing the development of our products, commercializing our products or generating significant\nrevenues; our ability to successfully develop, maintain and protect our proprietary products and technologies; and potential difficulties recruiting or retaining\npatients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials if patients are affected by the virus or are fearful of visiting or traveling to our clinical trial sites because of the\noutbreak of COVID-19.\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events, competitive dynamics, and healthcare, regulatory and\nscientific developments and depend on the economic circumstances that may or may not occur in the future or may occur on longer or shorter timelines than\nanticipated or not at all. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, we caution you\nthat forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the\ndevelopment of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this presentation.\n2\nBriaCell: Novel Immunotherapies to Fight Cancer\n▪ A clinical stage immuno-oncology company that is developing an entirely new class of targeted\nimmunotherapies to transform cancer care\n▪ Lead drug candidate Bria-IMT\n➢ Pivotal Phase 3 study underway in metastatic breast cancer (over 40K US deaths/year)\n➢ Phase 2 study demonstrated 2-fold increase in survival vs comparable patients in the literature\n➢ Unprecedented clinical benefit in checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) resistant patients\n➢ Remarkable clinical efficacy in patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases\n➢ Awarded Fast Track designation by FDA\n➢ Single agent and combination check point inhibitor (+ CPI) activity\n▪ Bria-OTS & Bria-OTS+ : Next generation novel cell-based cancer immunotherapy platform\n➢ Both are off-the-shelf and personalized.

Directly stimulate the immune system to enhance\ntargeted killing of cancer cells\nWHY WE COMBINE WITH CHECK POINT INHIBITORS (CPI)\n▪ Check point molecules are “BAD” → they blockour immunecellsfrom attackingcancercells\n▪ Check Point inhibitors (CPI) are “GOOD” → they overcome the cancer cells resistance to our immune systems\n▪ Bria-IMT activates the immune system and together with CPI puts it in overdrive to fight cancer\nHOW ARE PATIENTS RESPONDING?\nSafety & efficacy data similar or superior to approved breast cancer drugs when at a comparable stage of development\n▪ Total of 54 enrolled\n➢ 11 patients in combination with pembrolizumab\n➢ 44 patients in combination with retifanlimab, (one patient cross over from pembrolizumab to retifanlimab)\n▪ Overall survival (OS) of 13.4 months with Bria-IMT + CPI vs OS in similar metastatic breast cancer patients who have\nfailed 2+ prior therapy attempts is 6.7-9.8 months*\n▪ Similar response seen in patients resistant to ADCs and CPIs\n▪ No dose limiting toxicities to date\n▪ Immune system activation and remarkable responses in CNS metastases\nBria-IMT + CPI TURNS “COLD” TUMORS “HOT” i.e. IMMUNE SYSTEM ACTIVATION\nBaseline: After Three Cycles:\nCold Tumor Tumor Now Hot\nNasdaq: BCTX, BCTXW\nTSX: BCT\nTherapeutics Corp.\nREMARKABLE RESPONDERS HIGHLIGHTED\n▪ Patient failed 7 prior regimens including ADC Enhertu®\n▪ Patient failed 13 prior treatment regimens ▪ Extensive proptosis remarkably improved\n▪ Tumor behind the left eye causing proptosis (eye bulging) ▪ Significant tumor reduction along with improvement in eye\ncompletely resolved pain after only 3 cycles of treatment\nWHAT DOES THE FDA THINK?\n▪ Interim analysis 2H2025 for possible early BLA filing 2026\n▪ Survival-related end points for pivotal study\n▪ Single registrational study for commercialization\nWHAT’S NEXT?\n▪ Expand clinical sites and continue enrollment in pivotal Phase 3 registration study\n▪ Ongoing phase 2 patient data updates through 2024\n▪ Bria-OTS (personalized off-the-shelf approach) Phase 1/2 clinical trial enrolling→\n▪ BriaCell immunotherapy appears to be most effective when patients match the Bria-IMT HLA-type\n▪ Bria-OTS developed to match the patient’s HLA-type. Simple saliva test to determine patients’ HLA-type\n▪ Designed to provide HLA matched therapy to >99% of patients with advanced breast cancer in 4 cell lines\n▪ Developed into a platform technology to provide personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapies for many cancers\n▪ Enhanced version (Bria-OTS+ ) scheduled to enter the clinic 1H 2025\nForward Looking Statements\nBriaCellTherapeuticsCorp.(“BriaCell”)\nThispresentationisforinformationalpurposesonlyandshallnotconstituteanoffertosellorthe solicitationofanoffertosellorthesolicitationofanoffertobuyanysecuritiesofBriaCellTherapeutics Corp.(the“Company”)norshall\ntherebeanysaleofsecuritiesinanyjurisdictioninwhichsuchoffer, solicitationorsalewouldbeunlawfulpriortotheregistrationorqualificationunderthesecuritieslawsof anysuchjurisdiction.TheCompanymakescertainfilings\nwiththe Canadian securities regulatory authoritiesandtheU.S.SecuritiesandExchangeCommission(the“SEC”),allofwhichareavailableunder ourprofilesonSEDARatwww.sedar.comandonEDGARatwww.sec.gov.Foramore\ncompletediscussion oftheriskfactorsaffectingourbusiness,pleaserefertothesefilings.\nOurpubliccommunications,includingthispresentation,andSEDARandSECfilings,may contain statementsrelatedtofuture,notpast,events.Theseforward-lookingstatementsarebaseduponcurrent beliefsandexpectationsofthe\nCompany’smanagementandaresubjecttosignificantrisksand uncertainties.Theseforward-lookingstatementsoften,butnotalways,maybeidentifiedbytheuseof wordssuchas“believes,”“estimates,”“anticipates,”“targets,”\n“expects,”“plans,”“projects,”“intends,” “predicts,”“may,”“could,”“might,”“will,”“should,”“approximately,”potential”or,ineachcase,their negativeorothervariationsthereonorcomparableterminology,althoughnotallforward-\nlooking statementscontainthesewords.Ifunderlyingassumptionsproveinaccurateorrisksoruncertainties materialize,actualresultsmaydiffermateriallyfromthosesetforthintheforward-lookingstatements.\nTheseforward-lookingstatementsappearinanumberofplacesthroughoutthispresentationandinclude statementsregardingourintentions,beliefs,projections,outlook,analysesorcurrentexpectations concerning,amongother\nthings,ourrelianceonthirdpartiestocarryoutalargeportionofourbusiness; thepossibilitythatpre-clinicalandinitialclinicaltrialswillnotnecessarilybepredictiveoffutureresults; ourabilitytoobtainadditionalcapitalto\ncontinueouroperations;our relianceonkeypersonal; our successincompletingthedevelopmentofourproducts,commercializingourproductsorgenerating significantrevenues;ourabilitytosuccessfullydevelop, maintainand\nprotect our proprietary products andtechnologies;andpotentialdifficultiesrecruitingorretainingpatientsinourongoingandplanned clinicaltrialsifpatientsareaffectedbythevirusorarefearfulofvisitingortravelingtoour\nclinicaltrial sitesbecauseoftheoutbreakofCOVID-19.\nBytheirnature,forward-lookingstatementsinvolverisksanduncertaintiesbecausetheyrelatetoevents, competitivedynamics,andhealthcare,regulatoryandscientificdevelopmentsanddependon the economiccircumstancesthat\nmayormaynotoccurinthefutureormayoccuronlongerorshorter timelinesthananticipatedornotatall.Althoughwebelievethatwehaveareasonablebasisforeach forward-lookingstatementcontainedinthispresentation,we\ncaution you that forward-looking statementsarenotguaranteesoffutureperformanceandthatouractualresultsofoperations,financial conditionandliquidity,andthedevelopmentoftheindustryinwhichweoperatemaydiffer\nmaterially fromtheforwardlookingstatementscontainedinthispresentation."
