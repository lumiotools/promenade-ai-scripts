It should be read in conjunction with the Trust’s audited annual consolidated financial\nstatements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Additional information, including First Capital's current\nAnnual Information Form, is available on the SEDAR+ website at www.sedarplus.ca and on the FCR website at\nwww.fcr.ca.\nAll dollar amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted. Historical results and percentage\nrelationships contained in First Capital’s unaudited interim and audited annual consolidated financial statements and\nMD&A, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as indicative of its future operations. The information\ncontained in this MD&A is based on information available to Management and is dated as of October 28, 2024.\nCURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK\nDuring the first three quarters of 2024 inflation continued to ease, both globally and in Canada, from the multi-decade highs\nreached in many countries during the past two years. Reaffirming the conclusions from the Bank of Canada’s October\nBusiness Outlook Survey where the Bank cited muted inflationary pressure on behalf of businesses along with “weak”\ndemand, Canada’s September 2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by only 1.6% on a year-over-year basis. This measure of\ninflation was down from a 2.0% increase in August and the smallest yearly increase since February 2021 (+1.1%). Within the\nSeptember CPI basket, falling gasoline prices (-11.6% year-over-year) and air travel (-4.4%) aided the overall decline, while\ngrocery prices continued to climb by 2.4%, as did rents (+8.4%). Overall, Canadian inflation now is at or below the Bank of\nCanada’s targeted range of +/-2%.\nIn the United States, September’s employment report was surprisingly strong, thus taking the pressure off the US Federal\nReserve to make large interest rate cuts, even if the unemployment rate is higher than a year ago, and there are signs that\ngrowth is slowing. In Canada, economic growth is decelerating at a faster pace. While GDP growth was 2.1% in the second\nquarter, RBC Economics October forecasts suggest that third quarter GDP growth could decline to a paltry 1%. This is well\nbelow where the Bank of Canada’s forecasts were back in the summertime. Moreover, this sub-par growth rate is in the\ncontext of still sizable population growth, which means that per capital real GDP continues to decline.\nIn responding to easing inflation and slowing economic growth the Bank of Canada commenced its rate cut cycle in June\n2024. Through two additional 25 basis points cuts in July and September it cumulatively reduced the policy rate by 75 basis\npoints by the end of the third quarter. More recently, with signs that the Bank might now be “behind the curve” a sizable 50\nbasis point cut was implemented at the October 23rd meeting, bringing the year-to-date Policy rate reduction to 125 basis\npoints. With inflation within the target range and the potential that it heads still lower, there is impetus for the Bank of\nCanada to continue along its now established path of interest rate cuts.\nFirst Capital’s high-quality grocery-anchored and mixed-use portfolio continues to be resilient and has a demonstrated track\nrecord of high and steady occupancy, and producing strong cash collections, solid leasing volumes, and growth in its\naverage net rental rate over the longer term.\nProperty Portfolio, Core Competencies and Competitive Advantages\nFirst Capital is a leader in acquiring, developing, owning, and operating open-air grocery-anchored centres as well as\nsecuring the right to develop significant additional density through rezoning. With these two foundational Core\nCompetencies, First Capital is further differentiated from its peers by several competitive advantages which include its Core\nPortfolio of multi-tenant, grocery-anchored shopping centres and its sizable density pipeline.\nFCR’s Core Portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centres has a value of approximately $7.2 billion and comprises\napproximately 82% of First Capital’s total real estate investments. The Core Portfolio has the highest in place rents, the\nhighest average historical lease renewal lifts, the highest population density and is the most connected to public transit\nrelative to its publicly listed Canadian peers. The Core Portfolio is primarily located in urban and top-tier suburban\n1 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\nneighbourhoods within Canada’s largest and fastest growing cities, and its curated tenant mix typically includes pharmacy,\nliquor, banks, medical services, and an array of other complementary providers of daily necessity goods and services. FCR’s\nReal Estate Services Team continues to focus on property improvements, customer amenities, and merchandising mix or\ntenant uses that are most in demand to serve the communities and neighbourhoods in which the Trust operates.\nFirst Capital’s portfolio of future development sites is comprised of a density pipeline of approximately 22 million square\nfeet which exceeds the gross leasable area of FCR’s current property portfolio. The density pipeline is primarily located in\nhigh growth neighbourhoods with exceptional demographics within Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.\nThree-year Strategic Roadmap: Discipline|Stability|Growth\nIn February 2024, the Trust announced its three-year Strategic Roadmap centered around financial growth and leverage\nreduction objectives. The Roadmap is focused on the key objectives of stability and growth in FFO, Net Asset Value and\ndistributions per unit, coupled with a continued strengthening of key credit metrics.\nFirst Capital’s operating activities are focused upon managing its Core Portfolio of multi-tenant grocery-anchored centres to\ntheir maximum potential as it relates to growth in same-property net operating income and long-term value appreciation.\nFirst Capital’s investment activities are focused on retail development and redevelopment of core grocery-anchored\nshopping centres, select tuck-in and multi-tenant grocery-anchored shopping centre acquisitions, its entitlements program,\nand the development of strategic mixed-use properties where the REIT will typically have an ownership interest within the\n25% to 50% range.\nAsset divestitures will continue to be focused on FCR’s density and development properties and other non-grocery-\nanchored properties. Collectively, these assets are classified as ´Other properties´ and ´Residential development inventory´\nin FCR’s MD&A. This pool of assets currently comprises approximately 18% of FCR’s total real estate investments and has a\nvalue of approximately $1.6 billion.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, First Capital completed approximately $152 million of dispositions,\nincluding (i) it's 50% interest in the Royal Orchard development site, located in Thornhill, ON, (ii) Circa Residences (68\nresidential rental suites), located in Richmond, BC, (iii) a 41.7% interest in 1071 King St. W., located in Toronto, ON (reducing\nFCR's interest to 25%), (iv) 71 King St. W., a small medical office building located in Mississauga, ON, (v) Yonge-Davis Centre\nlocated in Newmarket, ON and (vi) the Trust's 42.5% interest in the retail component located at the base of 1092 Kingston\nRd., Toronto, ON. First Capital also received $9.5 million of proceeds in connection with the assignment of an agreement of\npurchase and sale for a land parcel in Montreal and recognized $17.9 million from earn-outs and density bonuses related to\nprevious property sales.\nThese asset sales were consistent with the REIT’s capital allocation objectives of crystallizing created value in certain\ndevelopment and density sites, as well as select income properties that are not multi-tenant grocery-anchored shopping\ncentres.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Trust has classified $235.6 million, at First Capital's share, of its assets as held for sale.\nThree-year Business Plan and Key Objectives\nFirst Capital’s business plan through to year-end 2026, includes the following key expectations and objectives:\n• Average annual same-property NOI growth of at least 3%\n• Property dispositions totaling approximately $1 billion on a cumulative basis, with an average expected yield of less\nthan 3%. The dispositions will continue to be focused on a mix of development sites and select low-yielding income\nproperties\n• An aggregate investment of approximately $500 million into property development and redevelopment\n• Development completions of approximately $200 million\n• Acquisitions of $100 million to $150 million, with a focus on multi-tenant, core grocery-anchored shopping centres\nas well as small, but strategic tuck-ins that are expected to be important to long-term value creation\n• A Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio that is in the low-8x range by year-end 2026; and,\n• OFFO per unit growth averaging at least 3%\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 2\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – continued\nManaging the balance sheet\nConsistent with the Trust’s Roadmap, First Capital is well positioned to continue to strengthen its financial position through\ndebt reduction and an improving cost of capital over the long-term, with a targeted net debt to EBITDA ratio in the low-9x\nrange by the end of 2024. As at September 30, 2024, First Capital's net debt to EBITDA ratio was 9.0x.\nAs of October 28, 2024, the Trust's liquidity position included approximately $0.9 billion of cash and undrawn credit\nfacilities with debt maturities for 2024 totaling $30 million on a proportionate basis. As at September 30, 2024, the Trust\nhad unencumbered properties with an IFRS value of approximately $6.2 billion and a net debt to asset ratio of 45.2% as well\nas a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio that improved to 9.0x from 10.1x year over year.\nNormal Course Issuer Bid (\"NCIB\")\nCommencing on May 18, 2022, First Capital implemented an NCIB pursuant to which it may repurchase its trust units for\ncancellation. The substantial disconnect that currently exists between the intrinsic value of the REIT’s units and their\npublicly traded price presents a significant opportunity to generate value through the repurchase of trust units. Therefore,\nfrom time to time, the purchase of FCR trust units at certain market prices below NAV presents an attractive use of the\nREIT’s capital that should afford additional value and liquidity for the issued and outstanding units, while benefiting\nremaining Unitholders by increasing their proportionate equity interest in the REIT. On May 16, 2024, First Capital received\nTSX approval for the renewal of its NCIB pursuant to which it may repurchase and cancel up to 21,113,939 of its outstanding\nunits until May 20, 2025. Cumulatively from May 2022 to September 30, 2024, the REIT has repurchased 7.9 million Trust\nunits for approximately $120.1 million.\nLending activities\nFirst Capital provides co-owner financing, priority mortgages and mezzanine loans to third parties in connection with certain\ntransactions and partnerships. These loans and mortgages receivable are secured and can provide FCR with the opportunity\nto acquire full or partial interests in the underlying assets that are consistent with its investment strategy through rights,\noptions or negotiated transactions. Therefore, in addition to generating interest income and fees, these lending activities\nprovide an alternative means to obtaining purchase options and/or participation in projects which may otherwise have not\nbeen accessible. Additionally, from time to time, FCR partners with experienced real estate lenders and investment\ncompanies whose primary business is lending which helps to mitigate risk.\nAs of September 30, 2024, FCR’s loans and mortgages receivable totaling $150.7 million (December 31, 2023 - $131.2\nmillion) are secured primarily by interests in investment properties or shares of entities owning investment properties\nwhich helps to mitigate the risk of non-payment.\nDevelopment initiatives\nManagement continually monitors economic and capital market forces and their potential impact on the portfolio, including\nproperties under development. As of September 30, 2024, FCR had approximately 0.7 million square feet under active\ndevelopment, including residential inventory. First Capital believes that the strategy to develop, own and operate\nproperties that meet the needs of everyday urban life in Canada’s most densely populated neighbourhoods will provide\nvalue over the long term in the assets in which it invests.\nOutlook\nThe International Monetary Fund expects the global economy to continue growing at a rate of about 3.2% through 2025.\nAlthough progress has remained uneven from month-to-month, inflation across most advanced economies appears to be\nmoving into central banks’ target ranges. In the face of a sharp and synchronized tightening of monetary policy around\nthe world over the last two years, the global economy has remained unusually resilient throughout the disinflationary\nprocess, avoiding a global recession.\nEconomic growth in the United States has been stronger than expected, led by strong consumption and jobs. In Canada,\neconomic growth grew by about 2.1% in the second quarter on the back of increased government spending and business\ninvestment, but more recently there are strong signals that growth is decelerating, perhaps rapidly. In its late October\noutlook, Canada’s central bank forecasts GDP growth of 1.2% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025, and 2.3% in 2026.\n3 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\nWith this as the backdrop, the Governing Council reduced the policy interest rate by 50 basis points in late October, for a\ncumulative reduction of 125 basis points since June of 2024 and with inflation already within the target range and the\npotential that it heads still lower, there is impetus for the Bank of Canada to continue along its now established path of\ninterest rate cuts.\nCertain aspects of the Trust’s business and operations that could potentially be impacted include rental income,\noccupancy, leasing terms and tenant improvements, future demand for space, and market rents, all of which impact the\nunderlying value of investment properties. In the current environment, the Trust continues to achieve strong leasing\nmetrics with a robust new and renewal lease pipeline coupled with upward trending market rental rates. First Capital\nbelieves, based on its exceptionally high-quality portfolio which has always been focused on everyday essentials, that it\nwill continue to attract high tenant demand for its space.\nFirst Capital will continue to be guided by its corporate responsibility and sustainability program, and values. The core\nbeliefs of collaboration, innovation, excellence, accountability, and passion continue to be demonstrated throughout all\nareas of the organization.\nNON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to measures determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), First Capital\nuses non-IFRS financial measures to analyze its financial performance. In Management’s view, such non-IFRS financial\nmeasures are commonly accepted and meaningful indicators of financial performance in the real estate industry and\nprovide useful supplemental information to both Management and investors. These measures do not have a standardized\nmeaning prescribed under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other real estate\nentities, and should not be construed as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS.\nThe following describe the non-IFRS measures First Capital currently uses in evaluating its financial performance.\nProportionate Interest\n\"Proportionate interest\" or \"Proportionate share\" is defined by Management as First Capital’s proportionate share of\nrevenues, expenses, assets and liabilities in all of its real estate investments. Under IFRS, FCR's seven equity accounted\njoint ventures are presented on one line item in the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of\nincome (loss), in aggregate. In the \"Non-IFRS Reconciliations and Financial Measures\" section of this MD&A, Management\npresents a consolidated balance sheet and income statement as if its joint ventures were proportionately consolidated. In\naddition, Management presents certain tables relating to its portfolio by geographic region, enterprise value, and debt\nmetrics on a proportionate basis to enhance the relevance of the information presented. The presentation of financial\ninformation at FCR's proportionate interest provides a useful and more detailed view of the operation and performance\nof First Capital's business and how Management operates and manages the business. This presentation also depicts the\nextent to which the underlying assets are leveraged, which are included in First Capital's debt metrics. In addition, FCR's\nlenders require Management to calculate its debt metrics on a proportionate interest basis.\nTo achieve the proportionate presentation of its seven equity accounted joint ventures, Management allocates FCR's\nproportionate share of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities to each relevant line item which replaces the one line\npresentation found in the IFRS consolidated financial statements. In addition, under IFRS, FCR exercises control over two\npartially owned ventures and consolidates 100% of the revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. In the reconciliations, the partially owned ventures are also presented as if they were\nproportionately consolidated. To achieve the proportionate presentation of its partially owned ventures, Management\nsubtracts the non-controlling interest's share (the portion FCR doesn't own) of revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities\non each relevant line item. FCR does not independently control its joint ventures that are accounted for using the equity\nmethod, and the proportionate presentation of these joint ventures does not necessarily represent FCR's legal claim to\nsuch items.\nNet Operating Income\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”) is defined by Management as property rental revenue less property operating costs. NOI is\na commonly used metric for analyzing real estate performance in Canada by real estate industry analysts, investors and\nManagement. Management believes that NOI is useful in analyzing the operating performance of First Capital’s portfolio.\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 4\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – continued\nTotal Same Property NOI\nTotal Same Property NOI (“SP NOI”) is defined by Management as NOI from properties categorized as “Same Property —\nstable” and “Same Property with redevelopment” (see definitions under “Real Estate Investments — Investment Property\nCategories” section of this MD&A). NOI from properties that have been (i) acquired, (ii) disposed, (iii) included in major\nredevelopment, ground-up development, properties under construction, and density and development land or (iv) held\nfor sale are excluded from the determination of SP NOI. SP NOI is presented at FCR's proportionate interest on a cash\nbasis, as it excludes straight-line rent. Management believes that SP NOI is a useful measure in understanding period over\nperiod changes in cash NOI for its Same Property portfolio due to occupancy, rental rates, operating costs and realty\ntaxes. A reconciliation from SP NOI to total NOI can be found in the \"Results of Operations - Net Operating Income\"\nsection of this MD&A.\nSame Property — Stable NOI\nSame Property — stable NOI is defined by Management as NOI from stable properties where the only significant activities\nare leasing and ongoing maintenance (see complete definition under “Real Estate Investments — Investment Property\nCategories” section of this MD&A). Management believes that Same Property — stable NOI is a useful measure in\nunderstanding period over period changes in cash NOI for its largest category of properties.\nFunds from Operations\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\") is a recognized measure that is widely used by the real estate industry, particularly by\npublicly traded entities that own and operate income-producing properties. First Capital calculates FFO in accordance\nwith the recommendations of the Real Property Association of Canada (“REALPAC”) as published in its most recent\nguidance on \"Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations for IFRS\" dated January 2022. Management\nconsiders FFO a meaningful additional financial measure of operating performance, as it excludes fair value gains and\nlosses on investment properties as well as certain other items included in FCR's net income (loss) that may not be the\nmost appropriate determinants of the long-term operating performance of FCR, such as investment property selling\ncosts; tax on gains or losses on disposals of properties; deferred income taxes; distributions on Exchangeable Units; fair\nvalue gains or losses on Exchangeable Units; fair value gains or losses on unit-based compensation; and any gains, losses\nor transaction costs recognized in business combinations. FFO provides a perspective on the financial performance of FCR\nthat is not immediately apparent from net income (loss) determined in accordance with IFRS. A reconciliation from net\nincome (loss) to FFO can be found in the \"Non-IFRS Reconciliations and Financial Measures — FFO, AFFO and ACFO\"\nsection of this MD&A.\nOperating Funds from Operations\nIn addition to REALPAC FFO described above, Management also discloses Operating Funds from Operations (\"OFFO\").\nManagement considers OFFO as its key operating performance measure that, when compared period over period,\nreflects the impact of certain factors on its core operations, such as changes in net operating income, interest expense,\ncorporate expenses and interest and other income. OFFO excludes the impact of the items in other gains (losses) and\n(expenses) that are not considered part of First Capital's on-going core operations.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\") is a supplementary measure that is widely used by the real estate industry,\nparticularly by publicly traded entities that own and operate income-producing properties. First Capital calculates AFFO in\naccordance with the recommendations of the Real Property Association of Canada (“REALPAC”) as published in its most\nrecent guidance on \"Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations for IFRS\" dated January 2022.\nManagement considers AFFO to be a meaningful financial measure of recurring economic earnings and relevant in\nunderstanding First Capital's ability to service it's debt, fund capital expenditures and pay distributions to Unitholders.\nAFFO is defined as FFO less amortization of straight-line rents, regular and recoverable maintenance capital expenditures,\nand incremental leasing costs. A reconciliation from FFO to AFFO can be found in the \"Non-IFRS Reconciliations and\nFinancial Measures — FFO, AFFO and ACFO\" section of this MD&A.\n5 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\nAdjusted Cash Flow from Operations\nAdjusted Cash Flow from Operations (“ACFO”) is a supplementary measure First Capital began using in 2017 to measure\noperating cash flow generated from the business. FCR calculates ACFO in accordance with the recommendations of\nREALPAC as published in its most recent guidance on \"Adjusted Cashflow From Operations (ACFO) for IFRS\" dated January\n2023.\nManagement considers ACFO a meaningful metric to measure operating cash flows as it represents sustainable cash\navailable to pay distributions to Unitholders. ACFO includes a number of adjustments to cash flow from operations under\nIFRS including, eliminating seasonal and non-recurring fluctuations in working capital, adding cash flows associated with\nequity accounted joint ventures and deducting actual revenue sustaining capital expenditures and actual capital\nexpenditures recoverable from tenants. Lastly, ACFO includes an adjustment to exclude the non-controlling interest's\nportion of cash flow from operations under IFRS, attributed to FCR's consolidated joint venture. A reconciliation of cash\nflow from operations under IFRS to ACFO can be found in the \"Non-IFRS Reconciliations and Financial Measures — FFO,\nAFFO and ACFO\" section of this MD&A.\nWeighted average units outstanding for OFFO and FFO\nFor purposes of calculating per unit amounts for OFFO and FFO, the weighted average number of diluted units\noutstanding includes the weighted average outstanding Trust Units and Exchangeable Units as at the end of the period;\nand assumes conversion of all outstanding Deferred Units, Restricted Units, Performance Units and any dilutive Options\nas at the end of the period.\nOFFO, FFO, AFFO and ACFO Payout Ratios\nOFFO, FFO, AFFO and ACFO payout ratios are supplementary non-IFRS measures used by Management to assess the\nsustainability of First Capital's distribution payments. OFFO and FFO payout ratios are calculated using distributions\ndeclared per unit divided by the OFFO and FFO per unit. The AFFO payout ratio is calculated using distributions declared\nper unit divided by AFFO per unit. The ACFO payout ratio is calculated on a rolling four quarter basis by dividing total cash\ndistributions paid by ACFO over the same period. Management considers a rolling four quarter ACFO payout ratio more\nrelevant than a payout ratio in any given quarter due to the impact of seasonal fluctuations in ACFO period over period.\nEnterprise Value\nEnterprise value is the sum of the principal or par value amounts of First Capital's net debt on a proportionate basis and\nthe market value of FCR's Trust Units and Exchangeable Units outstanding at the respective quarter end date. This\nmeasure is used by FCR to assess the total amount of capital employed in generating returns to Unitholders.\nNet Debt\nNet debt is a measure used by Management in the computation of certain debt metrics, providing information with\nrespect to certain financial ratios used in assessing First Capital's debt profile. Net debt is calculated as the sum of\nprincipal amounts outstanding on credit facilities and mortgages, bank indebtedness and the par value of senior\nunsecured debentures reduced by the cash balances at the end of the period on a proportionate basis.\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") is a measure used by\nManagement in the computation of certain debt metrics. Adjusted EBITDA, is calculated as net income (loss), adding back\nincome tax expense, interest expense and amortization and excluding the increase or decrease in the fair value of\ninvestment properties, fair value gains or losses on Exchangeable Units, fair value gains or losses on unit-based\ncompensation and other non-cash or non-recurring items on a proportionate basis. FCR also adjusts for incremental\nleasing costs, which is a recognized adjustment to FFO, in accordance with the recommendations of REALPAC.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful in assessing the Trust's ability to service its debt, finance capital\nexpenditures and provide for distributions to its Unitholders.\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 6\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – continued\nUnencumbered Aggregate Assets\nUnencumbered aggregate assets represents the value of assets that have not been pledged as security under a credit\nagreement or mortgage. The unencumbered aggregate asset value ratio is calculated as unencumbered aggregate assets\ndivided by the principal amount of unsecured debt, which consists of bank indebtedness, unsecured credit facilities and\nsenior unsecured debentures. This ratio is used by Management to assess the flexibility of First Capital to obtain various\nforms of debt financing at a reasonable cost of capital.\nNet Asset Value\nNet Asset Value (\"NAV\") represents the proportionate share of First Capital's total assets less the proportionate share of\nits total liabilities excluding deferred tax liabilities, and Exchangeable Units.\nNAV per diluted unit represents NAV, as calculated above, adjusted for the exclusion of the unit-based compensation\nplan liability and for the proceeds to be received upon the exercise of outstanding options divided by the number of\ndiluted units outstanding as at the end of the period. For purposes of calculating diluted per unit amounts for NAV, the\nnumber of diluted units outstanding includes all outstanding Trust Units and Exchangeable Units as at the end of the\nperiod and assumes conversion of outstanding Deferred Units, Restricted Units, Performance Units and Options as at the\nend of the period. Management believes that NAV is useful to financial statement users who consider it a key measure of\nthe intrinsic value of the Trust.\nOPERATING METRICS\nFirst Capital presents certain operating metrics and portfolio statistics in the MD&A, which include neighbourhood count,\nproperty category, GLA, occupancy, weighted average rate per occupied square foot, top 40 tenants, development\npipeline, and renewal activities. FCR uses these operating metrics to monitor and measure operational performance\nperiod over period. To align FCR's GLA reporting with its ownership interest in its properties, unless otherwise noted, all\nGLA is presented at FCR's ownership interest (19.4 million square feet at its ownership interest compared to 22.2 million\nsquare feet at 100% as at September 30, 2024). First Capital's operating metrics and GLA excludes residential GLA totaling\n151,000 square feet, at its ownership interest, as amounts are not significant at this time. In measuring performance or\nallocating resources, the Trust does not distinguish or group its operations on a geographical or any other basis and,\naccordingly, has a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes.\n7 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\nSUMMARY CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION AND HIGHLIGHTS\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues, Income and Cash Flows (1)\nRevenues and other income $ 192,907 $ 177,971 $ 574,182 $ 535,254\nNOI (2) $ 109,818 $ 106,938 $ 334,372 $ 316,501\nIncrease (decrease) in value of investment properties, net $ 17,488 $ (434,057) $ (11,964) $ (546,982)\nIncrease (decrease) in value of hotel property $ — $ — $ — $ 3,646\nNet income (loss) attributable to Unitholders $ 81,107 $ (327,546) $ 172,852 $ (307,857)\nNet income (loss) per unit attributable to Unitholders (diluted) $ 0.38 $ (1.53) $ 0.81 $ (1.44)\nWeighted average number of units - diluted (in thousands) 214,342 213,952 214,193 214,407\nCash provided by operating activities $ 51,870 $ 41,910 $ 153,953 $ 137,651\nDistributions\nDistributions declared $ 45,856 $ 45,841 $ 137,536 $ 137,738\nDistributions declared per unit $ 0.216 $ 0.216 $ 0.648 $ 0.648\nFinancial Information (1)\nInvestment properties (3) $ 8,255,913 $ 8,128,136\nTotal assets $ 9,167,729 $ 9,163,855\nMortgages (3) $ 1,249,121 $ 1,346,982\nCredit facilities $ 930,299 $ 1,006,668\nSenior unsecured debentures $ 1,895,863 $ 1,898,936\nExchangeable Units $ — $ 798\nUnitholders' equity $ 3,958,090 $ 3,820,718\nNet Asset Value per unit (2) $ 21.92 $ 21.26\nCapitalization and Leverage\nTrust Units outstanding (in thousands) 212,323 212,124\nExchangeable Units outstanding (in thousands) — 60\nEnterprise value (2) $ 8,098,578 $ 6,965,308\nNet debt to total assets (2) (4) 45.2% 46.3%\nNet debt to Adjusted EBITDA (2) (4) 9.0x 10.1x\nWeighted average term to maturity on mortgages, fixed rate unsecured term loans and senior\n3.7 3.1\nunsecured debentures (years)\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 8\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – continued\nAs at September 30 2024 2023\nOperational Information\nNumber of neighbourhoods 138 143\nGLA (square feet) - at 100% 22,247,000 22,307,000\nGLA (square feet) - at ownership interest 19,407,000 19,400,000\nOccupancy - Same Property - stable (2) 96.6% 95.7%\nTotal portfolio occupancy 96.5% 95.9%\nDevelopment pipeline and adjacent land (GLA) (5)\nCommercial pipeline (primarily retail) 668,000 1,049,000\nResidential pipeline 21,632,000 22,189,000\nWeighted average rate per occupied square foot $ 23.85 $ 23.08\nCommercial GLA developed and transferred online - at ownership interest (6) 91,000 122,000\nCost of GLA developed and brought online – at FCR's share $ 42,617 $ 56,131\nSame Property - stable NOI - increase (decrease) over prior period (2) (7) 4.9% 2.6%\nTotal Same Property NOI - increase (decrease) over prior period (2) (7) 5.0% 2.5%\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFunds from Operations (2) (4)\nOFFO $ 76,861 $ 68,832 $ 223,300 $ 185,587\nOFFO per diluted unit $ 0.36 $ 0.32 $ 1.04 $ 0.87\nOFFO payout ratio 60.2% 67.1% 62.2% 74.9%\nFFO $ 72,340 $ 68,615 $ 222,217 $ 185,934\nFFO per diluted unit $ 0.34 $ 0.32 $ 1.04 $ 0.87\nFFO payout ratio 64.0% 67.4% 62.5% 74.7%\nWeighted average number of units - diluted (in thousands) 214,342 213,952 214,193 214,407\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (2) (4)\nAFFO $ 58,875 $ 58,961 $ 187,267 $ 158,776\nAFFO per diluted unit $ 0.27 $ 0.28 $ 0.87 $ 0.74\nAFFO payout ratio 78.6% 78.4% 74.1% 87.5%\nWeighted average number of units - diluted (in thousands) 214,342 213,952 214,193 214,407\nAdjusted Cash Flow from Operations (2) (4)\nACFO $ 67,649 $ 55,458 $ 176,984 $ 167,017\nACFO payout ratio on a rolling four quarter basis 75.3% 81.3%\n(1) As presented in First Capital's IFRS consolidated financial statements, except for weighted average number of diluted units and per unit amounts.\n(2) Refer to the \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" section of this MD&A.\n(3) Includes properties and mortgages classified as held for sale.\n(4) Reflects joint ventures proportionately consolidated.

This enables FCR to better reflect its development, redevelopment and repositioning activities on its\nproperties, including density and land use intensification, and its completed and planned disposition activities. In\naddition, FCR revises comparative information to reflect property categories consistent with current period status. The\nproperty categories are as follows:\nTotal Same Property consisting of:\nSame Property – stable – includes stable properties where the only significant activities are leasing and ongoing\nmaintenance. Properties that will be undergoing a redevelopment in a future period, including adjacent parcels of\nland, and those having planning activities underway are also in this category until such development activities\ncommence. At that time, the property will be reclassified to either Same Property with redevelopment or to major\nredevelopment.\nSame Property with redevelopment – includes properties that are largely stable, including adjacent parcels of land,\nbut are undergoing incremental redevelopment or expansion activities (pads or building extensions) which intensify\nthe land use. Such redevelopment activities often include façade, parking, lighting and building upgrades.\nMajor redevelopment – includes properties in planning or recently completed multi-year redevelopment projects with\nsignificant intensification, reconfiguration and building and tenant upgrades.\nGround-up development – consists of recently completed new construction, either on a vacant land parcel typically\nsituated in an urban area or on an urban land site with conversion of an existing vacant building to retail use.\nProperties under construction – consists of properties under major redevelopment or ground-up development that are\nunder active construction.\nDensity and Development land – comprises land sites where there are no development activities underway, except for\nthose in the planning stage and certain zoned or unzoned sites where specific density value has been ascribed.\nAcquisitions and dispositions – consists of properties acquired during the period including those in close proximity to\nexisting properties. Dispositions include information for properties disposed of in the period.\nAssets classified as held for sale – consists of properties that meet the held for sale criteria under IFRS.\nFirst Capital has applied the above property categorization to the fair value, capital expenditures as well as leasing and\noccupancy activity on its portfolio, and to its Same Property NOI analysis to further assist in understanding FCR’s real\nestate activities and its operating and financial performance.\nPortfolio Overview\nThe Trust's Core Portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centres had a value of approximately $7.2 billion as at\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $7.1 billion as at December 31, 2023.\nAs at and for the three and nine months ended (millions of dollars) September 30, 2024\nIncome-Producing Properties Under Density and Proportionate Net Operating\nPortfolio Properties Construction Development Land Interest (1) Income (1)\nCore Portfolio $ 7,128 $ 6 $ 56 $ 7,190 $ 101 $ 300\nOther properties 917 114 320 1,351 11 40\nTotal Portfolio $ 8,045 $ 120 $ 376 $ 8,541 $ 112 $ 340\nResidential development inventory 253\nTotal real estate investments $ 8,794\n(1) At First Capital's proportionate interest.

In addition,\nFCR also incurs expenditures for the purposes of expansion, redevelopment, ground-up development as well as\ncondominium and townhome development activities.\nRevenue sustaining capital expenditures are required for maintaining First Capital’s property infrastructure and revenues\nfrom leasing of existing space. Revenue sustaining capital expenditures are generally not recoverable from tenants.\nHowever, certain leases provide the ability to recover from tenants, over time, a portion of capital expenditures to\nmaintain the physical aspects of FCR’s properties. Revenue sustaining capital expenditures generally include tenant\nimprovement costs related to new and renewal leasing, and capital expenditures required to maintain the physical\naspects of the properties, such as roof replacements and resurfacing of parking lots.\nRevenue enhancing capital expenditures are those expenditures that increase the revenue generating ability of FCR’s\nproperties. Revenue enhancing capital expenditures are incurred in conjunction with or in contemplation of a\ndevelopment or redevelopment strategy, a strategic repositioning after an acquisition, or in advance of a planned\ndisposition to maximize the potential sale price. First Capital owns and actively seeks to acquire older, well-located\nproperties in urban locations, where expenditures tend to be higher when they are subsequently repaired or redeveloped\nto meet FCR’s standards.\nCapital expenditures incurred in development and redevelopment projects include pre-development costs, direct\nconstruction costs, leasing costs, tenant improvements, borrowing costs, overhead including applicable salaries and direct\ncosts of internal staff directly attributable to the projects under active development.\n13 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\nCapital expenditures on investment properties and residential inventory by type are summarized in the table below:\nNine months ended September 30 2024 2023\nAdjustments for Adjustments for\nCapital Proportionate Proportionate Capital Proportionate Proportionate\nExpenditures Interest Interest (1) Expenditures Interest Interest (1)\nRevenue sustaining $ 13,503 $ (33) $ 13,470 $ 16,118 $ 7 $ 16,125\nRevenue enhancing 24,388 45 24,433 19,829 158 19,987\nExpenditures recoverable from tenants 10,817 13 10,830 5,861 — 5,861\nDevelopment expenditures 34,954 7,512 42,466 61,188 4,326 65,514\nSub-total $ 83,662 $ 7,537 $ 91,199 $ 102,996 $ 4,491 $ 107,487\nResidential Inventory $ 24,439 $ 16,653 $ 41,092 $ 28,762 $ 8,377 $ 37,139\nTotal $ 108,101 $ 24,190 $ 132,291 $ 131,758 $ 12,868 $ 144,626\n(1) Refer to the \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" section of this MD&A.\nCapital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $132.3 million, which was $12.3 million lower\nthan the same prior year period, in large part due to the completion of the Trust's Cedarbrae Mall and Stanley Park Mall\ndevelopment projects during the first quarter of 2024.\nValuation of Investment Properties\nThe approach selected for valuing investment properties depends on the type of property and other factors such as stage of\ndevelopment.

As a result, an overall net increase in the value of investment properties was recorded in the amount of\n$17.5 million ($18.9 million at FCR's share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

These non-income producing properties represent approximately 9%\nof the Trust's total portfolio value and consists of development land, adjacent land parcels, properties slated for\nredevelopment with limited income and properties in active development. As at September 30, 2024, the invested cost of\nthese non-income producing properties was $695 million as compared to a fair value of $749 million. Cumulative gains of\napproximately $54 million have been recognized to date and are expected to grow over time as development projects are\nentitled, advanced and completed.\nDevelopment and redevelopment activities are completed selectively, based on opportunities in First Capital’s properties\nor in the markets where FCR operates. First Capital’s development activities include redevelopment of stable properties,\nmajor redevelopment, and ground-up projects. Additionally, properties under development include land with future\ndevelopment potential. All commercial development activities are strategically managed to reduce risk, and properties\nare generally developed after obtaining anchor tenant lease commitments. Individual commercial buildings within a\ndevelopment are generally constructed only after obtaining lease commitments on a substantial portion of the space.\nDevelopment Pipeline\nAs at September 30, 2024, First Capital's portfolio is comprised of 19.4 million square feet of GLA at FCR's ownership\ninterest. Substantially all of this GLA is located in Canada's six largest urban growth markets which are undergoing\nsignificant land use intensification. As such, Management has identified meaningful incremental density available for\nfuture development within its existing portfolio. As at September 30, 2024, Management had identified approximately\n22.3 million square feet of incremental density which currently exceeds FCR's existing portfolio of 19.4 million square\nfeet.\nManagement undertakes a quarterly review of its entire portfolio and updates all of its future incremental density.\nManagement stratifies the density by expected project commencement time frame. Medium term includes project\ncommencement expected within the next 7 years, long term between 8 and 15 years and very long term beyond 15\nyears. First Capital’s incremental density is classified by type between commercial and residential. Commercial density\nprimarily consists of retail density.\nAs a substantial part of the portfolio is located in urban markets where significant land use intensification continues to\noccur, Management expects future incremental density will continue to grow and provide First Capital with increased\nopportunity to redevelop its generally low density properties.\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 16\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – continued\nA breakdown of the properties under construction, density and development land, and residential inventory within the\nportfolio by component and type is as follows:\nAs at September 30, 2024 Square feet (in thousands)\nValue recognized (1)(2)\nCommercial Residential Total (1) Recognized to date (2) (in millions)\nProperties under construction 68 260 328 328 $ 120\nDensity and development land\nMedium term 800 10,700 11,500\nLong term (100) 3,300 3,200\nVery long term (100) 7,000 6,900\n600 21,000 21,600 6,505 $ 376\nResidential inventory — 372 372 372 $ 253\nTotal development pipeline 668 21,632 22,300 7,205 $ 749\n(1) At First Capital's proportionate interest.

The $3.6 million net\ndecrease over prior year is primarily due to mark to market (non-cash) fluctuations on outstanding derivative financial\ninstruments employed by the Trust to reduce its borrowing costs and fix the rate of interest on certain variable-rate term\nloans. Also contributing to the decrease is the movement in the US to CDN dollar exchange rate driving gains or losses on\nthe translation of the Trust's US denominated debt as well as lower investment property selling costs of $1.0 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, First Capital recognized $3.8 million in other losses in its consolidated\nstatements of income (loss) compared to $1.9 million in other losses for the same prior year period. The $1.8 million net\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 32\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – continued\ndecrease over prior year is primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in losses on foreign currency translation, largely offset by\na $3.0 million increase in unrealized gains on the mark to market of derivatives.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, deferred income tax expense (recovery) totaled\n($3.2) million and ($25.0) million, respectively, compared to ($38.3) million and ($51.1) million, respectively, over the\nsame prior year periods. The decrease of $35.1 million and $26.1 million, respectively, in deferred income tax recovery\nwas primarily due to an increase in taxable temporary differences applicable to the Trust's corporate subsidiaries.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Unitholders\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income (loss) attributable to Unitholders was $81.1 million or\n$0.38 per diluted unit compared to ($327.5) million or ($1.53) per diluted unit for the same prior year period. The\n$408.7 million increase in net income over prior year was primarily due to a $432.8 million decrease in the fair value of\ninvestment property in the third quarter of 2023 versus an $18.9 million increase in fair value recognized in the third\nquarter of 2024, on a proportionate basis.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income (loss) attributable to Unitholders was $172.9 million or\n$0.81 per diluted unit compared to ($307.9) million or ($1.44) per diluted unit for the same prior year period. The\n$480.7 million increase in net income over prior year was primarily due to lower fair value decreases on investment\nproperty of $490.8 million, partially offset by lower deferred income tax recovery of $26.1 million, on a proportionate\nbasis. Additionally, a $9.5 million assignment fee was recognized in the first quarter of 2024, related to a small\ndevelopment parcel located in Montreal.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY\nTotal Capital Employed\nThe real estate business is capital intensive by nature. First Capital’s capital structure is key to financing growth and\nproviding sustainable cash distributions to Unitholders. In the real estate industry, financial leverage is used to enhance\nrates of return on invested capital. Management believes that the combination of debt and equity in FCR's capital\nstructure provides stability and reduces risk, while generating an acceptable return on investment, taking into account\nthe long-term business strategy of First Capital.\nAs at September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLiabilities (principal amounts outstanding)\nMortgages (1) $ 1,342,474 $ 1,432,611\nCredit facilities (1) 942,226 1,151,226\nSenior unsecured debentures 1,900,000 1,600,000\nTotal Debt (1) $ 4,184,700 $ 4,183,837\nCash and cash equivalents (1) (67,171) (92,499)\nNet Debt (1) (2) $ 4,117,529 $ 4,091,338\nEquity market capitalization (3) 3,981,049 3,254,907\nEnterprise value (1) $ 8,098,578 $ 7,346,245\nTrust Units outstanding (000's) 212,323 212,184\nClosing market price $ 18.75 $ 15.34\n(1) At First Capital's proportionate interest.

DBRS indicates that BBB rated obligations may be vulnerable\nto future events. A rating trend, expressed as positive, stable or negative, provides guidance in respect of DBRS’ opinion\nregarding the outlook for the rating in question.\nOn November 9, 2023, S&P withdrew its BBB- issuer credit rating on First Capital and its BBB- issue-level ratings on its\nunsecured debentures at the issuer's request.

First Capital manages its liquidity risk by staggering debt maturities, renegotiating expiring credit\narrangements proactively, using revolving credit facilities, maintaining a large pool of unencumbered assets, and issuing\nequity when deemed appropriate.\nSources of liquidity primarily consist of cash flow from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and available capacity\nunder First Capital’s existing revolving credit facilities.

unit, over the same prior\nyear period. The increase was primarily due to higher interest and other income of $9.6 million owing to the recognition\nof a density bonus payment of $11.3 million in connection with a previously sold property. This increase was partially\noffset by a non-recurring legal settlement of $3.8 million recognized in the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, OFFO increased $37.7 million, or $0.18 per unit, over prior year. The\nincrease in OFFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $37.7 million benefited from higher NOI of $18.0\nmillion, inclusive of a $5.5 million settlement with Nordstrom with respect to the early termination of its lease at One\nBloor East. OFFO also includes a $9.5 million ($0.04 per unit) assignment fee related to a small development parcel\nlocated in Montreal as well as an $11.3 million ($0.05 per unit) density bonus payment in connection with a previously\nsold property.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, FFO increased $3.7 million and $36.3 million, or $0.02 and\n$0.17 per unit, respectively, over the same prior year periods. The increases were driven by higher Operating FFO of $8.0\nmillion and $37.7 million, respectively, partially offset by year-over-year decreases in other gains (losses) and (expenses).\nThese other gains (losses) and (expenses) are comprised primarily of mark-to-market (non-cash) gains and losses related\nto derivative financial instruments employed by First Capital to reduce its borrowing costs and fix the rate of interest on\ncertain variable-rate term loans. Over the life of each loan, the cumulative gain or loss on the related derivative\ninstruments should net to $Nil.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations\nA reconciliation from FFO to AFFO can be found in the table below:\nThree and nine months ended, respectively % change 2024 2023 % change 2024 2023\nFFO (1) $ 72,340 $ 68,615 $ 222,217 $ 185,934\nAdd (deduct):\nRevenue sustaining capital expenditures (4,494) (4,528) (13,470) (16,125)\nRecoverable capital expenditures (5,733) (2,948) (10,830) (5,861)\nIncremental leasing costs (1,844) (1,738) (5,743) (5,566)\nStraight-line rent adjustment (1,394) (440) (4,907) 394\nAFFO (1) (0.1%) $ 58,875 $ 58,961 17.9% $ 187,267 $ 158,776\nAFFO per diluted unit (0.3%) $ 0.27 $ 0.28 18.1% $ 0.87 $ 0.74\nWeighted average number of units – diluted\n0.2% 214,342 213,952 (0.1%) 214,193 214,407\n(in thousands)\n(1) Refer to the \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" section of this MD&A.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, AFFO remained consistent year-over-year. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, AFFO increased $28.5 million, or $0.13 per unit, over prior year primarily due to higher FFO, partially\noffset by a higher straight-line rent adjustment.\n45 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\nAdjusted Cash Flow from Operations\nA reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to ACFO is presented below:\nThree and nine months ended, respectively 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash provided by operating activities $ 51,870 $ 41,910 $ 153,953 $ 137,651\nAdd (deduct):\nWorking capital adjustments (1) 24,034 18,621 42,771 48,388\nAdjustment for equity accounted joint ventures 1,669 514 3,276 1,994\nRevenue sustaining capital expenditures (4,494) (4,528) (13,470) (16,125)\nRecoverable capital expenditures (5,733) (2,948) (10,830) (5,861)\nLeasing costs on properties under development 461 435 1,436 1,392\nNon-controlling interest (158) 1,454 (152) (422)\nACFO (2) $ 67,649 $ 55,458 $ 176,984 $ 167,017\n(1) Working capital adjustments primarily include adjustments for prepaid as well as accrued property taxes as their levels vary considerably over the course of the year as\nwell as certain other adjustments as specified in the most recent REALPAC guidance on ACFO issued in January 2023.\n(2) Refer to the \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" section of this MD&A.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, ACFO totaled $67.6 million and $177.0 million compared to\n$55.5 million and $167.0 million for the same prior year periods, respectively. The $12.2 million and $10.0 million\nincrease, respectively, in ACFO was primarily due to higher operating cash flows year-over-year.\nACFO Payout Ratio\nFirst Capital's ACFO payout ratio for the four quarters ended September 30, 2024 is calculated as follows:\nTwelve months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 Q3 2024 Q2 2024 Q1 2024 Q4 2023\nACFO (1) $ 243,330 $ 67,649 $ 64,147 $ 45,188 $ 66,346\nCash distributions paid 183,345 45,850 45,844 45,832 45,819\nACFO payout ratio (1) 75.3%\n(1) Refer to the \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" section of this MD&A.\nFirst Capital's ACFO payout ratio for the four quarters ended September 30, 2023 is calculated as follows:\nTwelve months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 Q3 2023 Q2 2023 Q1 2023 Q4 2022\nACFO (1) $ 226,281 $ 55,458 $ 72,787 $ 38,772 $ 59,264\nCash distributions paid 183,972 45,845 45,868 46,125 46,134\nACFO payout ratio (1) 81.3%\n(1) Refer to the \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" section of this MD&A.\nFirst Capital considers a rolling four quarter payout ratio (cash distributions / ACFO) to be more relevant than a payout\nratio in any given quarter due to seasonal fluctuations in ACFO. For the four quarters ended September 30, 2024, the\nACFO payout was 75.3% (September 30, 2023 - 81.3%).\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 46\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – continued\nNet Asset Value\nThe following table provides FCR's calculation of NAV for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended\nDecember 31, 2023:\nAs at September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUnitholders' equity $ 3,958,090 $ 3,933,377\nDeferred tax liabilities 718,502 751,789\nNet Asset Value (NAV) (1) $ 4,676,592 $ 4,685,166\nUnits outstanding 212,323 212,184\nNAV per unit - diluted (2) $ 21.92 $ 21.95\n(1) Refer to the \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" section of this MD&A.\n(2) Adjusted for 2.0 million Deferred Units, Restricted Units and Performance Units and 5.5 million unit options outstanding with an average exercise price of $19.83 (implied\noption proceeds of $109.5 million) and the exclusion of the unit-based compensation plan liability.\nThe decrease in NAV per diluted unit from $21.95 to $21.92 is primarily driven by the year to date fair value decrease on\ninvestment properties as well as mark to market losses on outstanding interest rate swaps recorded in other\ncomprehensive income, largely offset by retained FFO for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nDISTRIBUTIONS\nDistributions on the Trust Units are declared at the discretion of the Board of Trustees. In determining the annual level or\nmonthly amount of distributions, the Board of Trustees considers many factors including the macro economic and industry\nspecific environment, common industry cash distribution practices, investor expectations, capital market conditions,\nforecasted cash flows and debt metrics, anticipated capital requirements, estimated taxable income, and the overall\nfinancial condition of the Trust.\nThe Trust does not use net income (loss), as calculated in accordance with IFRS, as the basis to determine the annual\ndistribution rate. Net income (loss) is impacted by non-cash adjustments, including fair value changes to investment\nproperties and Exchangeable Units, and is not equivalent to taxable income and therefore is expected to vary from the\ndistributions declared.\nThe following chart specifies distributions declared by First Capital:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n(in dollars) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDistributions declared per unit $ 0.216 $ 0.216 $ 0.648 $ 0.648\n47 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT GUARANTORS\nFirst Capital's senior unsecured debentures are guaranteed by the wholly owned subsidiaries of the Trust, other than\nnominee subsidiaries and inactive subsidiaries.

The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial\nstatements have been prepared by applying the same accounting policies and methods of computation as compared with\nthe most recent audited annual consolidated financial statements.\nFirst Capital's 2023 Annual Report contains a discussion of the material accounting policies most affected by estimates\nand judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, being the accounting policies relating to\nestimates of fair values of investment properties, valuation of financial instruments both for disclosure and measurement\npurposes, and estimating deferred tax assets and liabilities. Management determined that as at September 30, 2024,\nthere is no change to the assessment of the material accounting policies most affected by estimates and judgments as\ndetailed in FCR's 2023 Annual Report.\nFuture Changes in Accounting Policies\nThe IASB has issued a new standard to supersede amendments to an existing standard. These changes are not yet\nadopted by First Capital and could have an impact on future periods. These changes are described in detail below:\nIFRS 18, \"Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\"\nIn April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, \"Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\" (\"IFRS 18\"), which replaces\nIAS 1, \"Presentation of Financial Statements\". IFRS 18 aims to improve the comparability and transparency of\ncommunication in financial statements by introducing a number of new requirements:\n(i) classify income and expenses in the statement of profit or loss into categories such as, operating, investing, financing,\nincome taxes and discontinued operations as well as present defined subtotals;\n(ii) provide note disclosure on management-defined performance measures that are used in communications outside\nthe entity's financial statements;\n(iii) enhance the aggregation or disaggregation of information to ensure that items are classified and aggregated based\non shared characteristics and material information is not obscured; and\n(iv) implement narrow scope amendments that have been made to IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”, IAS 34 “Interim\nFinancial Reporting”, and other minor amendments to other standards. Some requirements previously included\nwithin IAS 1 have been moved to IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”, which has\nbeen renamed IAS 8 “Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements”.\nIFRS 18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027, and requires retrospective\napplication. Early adoption is permitted but will need to be disclosed. Management is evaluating the impact of IFRS 18,\nincluding the impact of the amendments to the other accounting standards, on First Capital's consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of First Capital, with the assistance\nof other staff and Management of FCR to the extent deemed necessary, have designed FCR’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the various reports filed or\nsubmitted by FCR under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported accurately and have\ndesigned internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.\nIn the design of its internal controls over financial reporting, First Capital used the 2013 framework published by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 50\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – continued\nFirst Capital did not make any changes in its internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on FCR's internal controls over\nfinancial reporting. On an ongoing basis, FCR will continue to analyze its controls and procedures for potential areas of\nimprovement.\nManagement does recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only\nprovide reasonable assurance and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In the unforeseen\nevent that lapses in the disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting occur and/or\nmistakes happen, First Capital intends to take the necessary steps to minimize the consequences thereof.\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nFirst Capital, as an owner of income-producing properties and development properties, is exposed to numerous business\nrisks in the normal course of its business that can impact both short- and long-term performance. Income-producing and\ndevelopment properties are affected by general economic conditions and local market conditions such as oversupply of\nsimilar properties or a reduction in tenant demand. It is the responsibility of Management, under the supervision of the\nBoard of Trustees, to identify and, to the extent possible, mitigate or minimize the impact of all such business risks. The\nmajor categories of risk First Capital encounters in conducting its business and some of the actions it takes to mitigate\nthese risks are included in its MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as its most current Annual\nInformation Form, which provides a detailed description of these and other risks that may affect FCR.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST\nFirst Capital Real Estate Investment Trust (\"First Capital\", \"FCR\", or the \"Trust\") is an unincorporated, open-ended mutual\nfund trust governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada, and established pursuant to a declaration of trust dated October 16,\n2019, as may be amended from time to time (the \"Declaration of Trust\"). First Capital owns, operates and develops\ngrocery-anchored, open-air centres in neighbourhoods with the strongest demographics in Canada. The Trust is listed on\nthe Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") under the symbol \"FCR.UN\", and its head office is located at 85 Hanna Avenue, Suite\n400, Toronto, Ontario, M6K 3S3.\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\n(a) Statement of compliance\nThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34,\n“Interim Financial Reporting” as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), and as such, do not\ninclude all of the disclosures that would be included in audited annual consolidated financial statements. These\nunaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with First Capital’s audited\nannual consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(b) Basis of presentation\nThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and have\nbeen presented in Canadian dollars rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated. These unaudited\ninterim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by applying the same accounting policies,\nassessments of estimates and judgments, and methods of computation as compared with the most recent audited annual\nconsolidated financial statements.\n(c) Future Changes in Accounting Policies\nIFRS 18, \"Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\"\nIn April 2024, the IASB issued IFRS 18, \"Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\" (\"IFRS 18\"), which replaces\nIAS 1, \"Presentation of Financial Statements\". IFRS 18 aims to improve the comparability and transparency of\ncommunication in financial statements by introducing a number of new requirements:\n(i) classify income and expenses in the statement of profit or loss into categories such as, operating, investing, financing,\nincome taxes and discontinued operations as well as present defined subtotals;\n(ii) provide note disclosure on management-defined performance measures that are used in communications outside\nthe entity's financial statements;\n(iii) enhance the aggregation or disaggregation of information to ensure that items are classified and aggregated based\non shared characteristics and material information is not obscured; and\n(iv) implement narrow scope amendments that have been made to IAS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”, IAS 34 “Interim\nFinancial Reporting”, and other minor amendments to other standards. Some requirements previously included\nwithin IAS 1 have been moved to IAS 8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”, which has\nbeen renamed IAS 8 “Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements”.\nIFRS 18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027, and requires retrospective\napplication. Early adoption is permitted but will need to be disclosed. Management is evaluating the impact of IFRS 18,\nincluding the impact of the amendments to the other accounting standards, on First Capital's consolidated financial\nstatements.\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 58\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – continued\n(d) Approval of unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements\nThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Trustees and\nauthorized for issue on October 28, 2024.\n3.

As a result, an overall net increase in the value of investment properties was recorded in the amount of\n$17.5 million ($18.9 million at FCR's share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, an overall net decrease in the value of investment properties was recorded in the amount of\n$12.0 million ($53.2 million at FCR's share).\nThe sensitivity of the fair values of investment properties to stabilized overall capitalization rates as at September 30, 2024\nis set out in the table below:\nAs at September 30, 2024 (millions of dollars)\nResulting increase (decrease) in fair\n(Decrease) Increase in stabilized overall capitalization rate value of investment properties\n(1.00%) $ 1,787\n(0.75%) $ 1,270\n(0.50%) $ 804\n(0.25%) $ 383\n0.25% $ (350)\n0.50% $ (671)\n0.75% $ (966)\n1.00% $ (1,238)\nAdditionally, a 1% increase or decrease in stabilized net operating income (\"SNOI\") would result in a $81 million increase or\na $81 million decrease, respectively, in the fair value of investment properties. SNOI is not a measure defined by IFRS. SNOI\nreflects stable property operations, assuming a certain level of vacancy, capital and operating expenditures required to\nmaintain a stable occupancy rate. The average vacancy rates used in determining SNOI for non-anchor tenants generally\nrange from 2% to 5%. A 1% increase in SNOI coupled with a 0.25% decrease in the stabilized capitalization rate would result\nin an increase in the fair value of investment properties of $468 million, and a 1% decrease in SNOI coupled with a 0.25%\nincrease in the stabilized capitalization rate would result in a decrease in the fair value of investment properties of $427\nmillion.\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 60\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – continued\n(c) Investment properties – Acquisitions\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, First Capital acquired investment properties as\nfollows:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal purchase price, including acquisition costs $ — $ 1,944 $ 33,453 $ 72,827\nSettlement of loans receivable on acquisition — (1,574) — (1,574)\nTotal cash paid $ — $ 370 $ 33,453 $ 71,253\n(d) Assets classified as held for sale and dispositions\nFirst Capital has certain assets classified as held for sale.

Measures used in these ratios are defined below:\n• Debt consists of principal amounts outstanding on credit facilities and mortgages, and the par value of senior\nunsecured debentures;\n• Net debt is calculated as Debt, as defined above, reduced by cash balances at the end of the period;\n• Secured indebtedness includes mortgages and any draws under the secured facilities that are collateralized against\ninvestment property;\n• Adjusted EBITDA, is calculated as net income, adding back income tax expense; interest expense; and amortization and\nexcluding the increase or decrease in the fair value of investment properties, Exchangeable Units and unit-based\ncompensation; other gains (losses) and (expenses); and other non-cash or non-recurring items. The Trust also adjusts\nfor incremental leasing costs, which is a recognized adjustment to Funds from Operations, in accordance with the\nrecommendations of the Real Property Association of Canada;\n• Fixed charges include regular principal and interest payments and capitalized interest in the calculation of interest\nexpense; and\n• Unencumbered assets include the value of assets that have not been pledged as security under any credit agreement\nor mortgage. The unencumbered asset value ratio is calculated as unencumbered assets divided by the principal\namount of the unsecured debt, which consists of the bank indebtedness, unsecured bank term loans, unsecured credit\nfacilities, and senior unsecured debentures.\n65 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\n10.

RISK MANAGEMENT\nIn the normal course of its business, First Capital is exposed to a number of risks that can affect its operating\nperformance. Certain of these risks, and the actions taken to manage them, are as follows:\n(a) Interest rate risk\nFirst Capital structures its financings so as to stagger the maturities of its debt, thereby mitigating its exposure to interest\nrate and other credit market fluctuations. A portion of FCR’s mortgages, loans and credit facilities are floating rate\ninstruments. From time to time, FCR may enter into interest rate swap contracts, bond forwards or other financial\ninstruments to modify the interest rate profile of its outstanding debt or highly probable future debt issuances without an\nexchange of the underlying principal amount.\n(b) Credit risk\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that tenants and/or debtors may experience financial difficulty and be unable or\nunwilling to fulfill their lease commitments or loan obligations. First Capital mitigates the risk of credit loss from tenants\nby investing in well-located properties in urban markets that attract high quality tenants, ensuring that its tenant mix is\ndiversified, and by limiting its exposure to any one tenant. As at September 30, 2024, Loblaw Companies Limited\n(“Loblaw”) is FCR's largest tenant and accounts for 10.4% of FCR’s annualized minimum rent and has an investment grade\ncredit rating. Other than Loblaw, no other tenant accounts for more than 10% of the annualized minimum rent. A\ntenant’s success over the term of its lease and its ability to fulfill its lease obligations is subject to many factors. There can\nbe no assurance that a tenant will be able to fulfill all of its existing commitments and leases up to the expiry date. First\nCapital mitigates the risk of credit loss from debtors by undertaking a number of activities typical in lending arrangements\nincluding obtaining registered mortgages on the real estate properties.\nFirst Capital’s leases typically have lease terms between 5 and 20 years and may include clauses to enable periodic\nupward revision of the rental rates, and lease contract extension at the option of the lessee.\n(c) Liquidity risk\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid. This tends to limit First Capital’s ability to sell components of its portfolio\npromptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. If FCR were required to quickly liquidate its assets,\nthere is a risk that it would realize sale proceeds of less than the current value of its real estate investments.\nFIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024 74\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – continued\nAn analysis of First Capital’s contractual maturities of its material financial liabilities and other contractual commitments\nas at September 30, 2024 is set out below:\nAs at September 30, 2024 Payments due by period\nRemainder of 2024 2025 to 2026 2027 to 2028 Thereafter Total\nScheduled mortgage principal amortization $ 8,457 $ 63,196 $ 55,626 $ 48,327 $ 175,606\nMortgage principal repayments on maturity — 161,330 217,449 698,049 1,076,828\nCredit facilities and bank indebtedness 30,389 649,612 50,298 200,000 930,299\nSenior unsecured debentures — 600,000 700,000 600,000 1,900,000\nInterest obligations (1) 45,322 285,848 175,500 168,268 674,938\nLand leases (expiring between 2027 and 2061) 170 1,292 1,279 15,723 18,464\nContractually committed costs to complete current\ndevelopment projects (2) 14,304 68,063 — — 82,367\nOther commitments — 25,835 — — 25,835\nTotal contractual obligations $ 98,642 $ 1,855,176 $ 1,200,152 $ 1,730,367 $ 4,884,337\n(1) Interest obligations include expected interest payments on mortgages and credit facilities as at September 30, 2024 (assuming balances remain outstanding through to\nmaturity) and senior unsecured debentures, as well as standby credit facility fees.\n(2) Includes amounts related to equity accounted joint ventures.\nFirst Capital manages its liquidity risk by staggering debt maturities; renegotiating expiring credit arrangements\nproactively; using secured and unsecured credit facilities, mortgages and unsecured debentures; and issuing equity when\nconsidered appropriate. As at September 30, 2024, there was $0.8 billion (December 31, 2023 – $1.0 billion) of cash\nadvances drawn against First Capital’s unsecured credit facilities.\nIn addition, as at September 30, 2024, First Capital had $28.2 million (December 31, 2023 – $28.6 million) of outstanding\nletters of credit issued by financial institutions primarily to support certain of FCR’s contractual obligations and $Nil\n(December 31, 2023 – $Nil) of bank overdrafts.\n(d) Unit price risk\nFirst Capital is exposed to Trust Unit price risk as a result of the issuance of unit-based compensation. Unit-based\ncompensation liabilities are recorded at their fair value based on market trading prices and negatively impact operating\nincome when the Trust Unit price rises and positively impact operating income when the Trust Unit price declines.\n75 FIRST CAPITAL REIT THIRD QUARTER REPORT 2024\n22.
