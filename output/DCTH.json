(Nasdaq: DCTH) (“Delcath” or the “Company”), an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the liver, today reported financial results and business highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Total third quarter revenues of $11.2 million, up 44% from the prior quarter, including $10.0 million from HEPZATO KIT™ (melphalan/Hepatic Delivery System) and $1.2 million from CHEMOSAT®;\n  * Activated four HEPZATO treatment centers in the U.S. during the third quarter and one more in October, bringing the total to twelve active centers; another center has scheduled their first treatment in November with a further 10 centers having partially or fully completed preceptorship training;\n  * Reported that CHOPIN, an investigator-initiated study which is evaluating the effect of sequencing immunotherapy with CHEMOSAT liver directed therapy, is now fully enrolled with 76 patients;\n  * Ended the third quarter with cash and investments of $14.0 million with quarterly cash burn of $3.6 million; and\n  * Subsequent to September 30, 2024:\n    * Submitted the final principal and interest payments of $2.8 million on the Rosalind note payable and as a result have no outstanding debt obligations; and\n    * All remaining Tranche B warrants from the March 29, 2023 PIPE were exercised by the November 6, 2024 expiration date resulting in approximately $25 million in proceeds.\n\n\n\n“We are pleased with HEPZATO's robust market adoption in the U.S., a testament to its clinical impact and the confidence physicians are showing in its use,” said Gerard Michel, Delcath’s Chief Executive Officer. “Given our strong balance sheet and consistent revenue growth, which puts us on the cusp of profitability, Delcath is in a solid position to expand our development pipeline. Based on broad interest from oncology leaders, we are advancing programs for the use of HEPZATO in liver dominant colorectal and breast cancers.”\n\n**Recent Publications**\n\n  * Presented subgroup analyses data from the FOCUS Phase 3 trial of HEPZATO at ESMO 2024, demonstrating similar outcomes in overall survival, overall response rate, and progression free survival between patients with and without extrahepatic lesions or based on prior therapy. In addition, tumor responses were observed throughout the entire treatment period supporting the strategy to continue treatment until best response is achieved;\n  * Announced multiple independent investigator-sponsored retrospective studies of HEPZATO and CHEMOSAT:\n    * A 30-patient study published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology by researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. The study reported that HEPZATO used in first- or second-line therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma provided better disease control in the liver and improved progression-free survival compared to both immunotherapy and other liver-directed therapies;\n    * A 167-patient study published in the journal Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology by investigators from the University of Tübingen, Germany. The study reported that first-line liver-directed therapies, including CHEMOSAT, significantly improve melanoma-specific survival in patients with liver metastases from uveal melanoma, compared to first-line systemic therapies; and\n    * A study published in the ESMO journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology by researchers from the University Hospital of Leipzig reporting the results of 33 patients treated with CHEMOSAT. The study included previously treated patients with unresectable intrahepatic metastases from seven different cancer types and reported a hepatic disease control rate of 91% with six patients (18.2%) achieving complete response in the liver. Median hepatic progression-free survival was 52 weeks across all patients.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $11.2 million compared to $0.4 million for the same period in the prior year. Revenue includes sales of $10.0 million of HEPZATO in the U.S. and $1.2 million of CHEMOSAT in Europe.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $3.9 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The change in research and development expenses is primarily due to lower costs associated with expanded access protocol incurred in previous periods offset by an increase in medical affairs and regulatory costs associated with an approved product.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $7.0 million compared to $6.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase primarily relates to commercial launch activities including marketing-related expenses and additional personnel in the commercial team.\n\nThe Company submitted the final principal payment due to Avenue Venture Opportunities Fund, L.P. on August 1, 2024 for the Loan and Security Agreement entered into in August 2021. As of September 30, 2024 our cash and investments totaled $14.0 million.\n\nSubsequent to the end of the third quarter, we submitted the final principal and interest payment of $2.8 million on the outstanding Rosalind note payable and received approximately $25 million in proceeds from the exercise of Tranche B Warrants from the previous March 29, 2023 PIPE. Currently, there are no outstanding debt obligations.\n\n**Conference Call Information**  \n---  \nTo participate in this event, dial-in approximately 5 to 10 minutes before the beginning of the call.  \nEvent Date:| Friday, November 8, 2024  \nTime:| 8:30 AM Eastern Time  \nParticipant Numbers  \nToll Free:| 1-877-407-3982  \nInternational:| 1-201-493-6780  \nWebcast:| [https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1691899&tp_key=9d94cb0736](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fviavid.webcasts.com%2Fstarthere.jsp%3Fei%3D1691899%26tp_key%3D9d94cb0736&esheet=54149460&newsitemid=20241108582249&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fviavid.webcasts.com%2Fstarthere.jsp%3Fei%3D1691899%26amp%3Btp_key%3D9d94cb0736&index=1&md5=a3f4d31b219bb816a049a9d4d240e435)  \n  \nA replay of the webinar will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call and will be archived on the company’s website: [https://delcath.com/investors/events-presentations/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdelcath.com%2Finvestors%2Fevents-presentations%2F&esheet=54149460&newsitemid=20241108582249&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fdelcath.com%2Finvestors%2Fevents-presentations%2F&index=2&md5=9ad49cc7079fc7f4904652545d1682d4)\n\n**About Delcath Systems, Inc., HEPZATO KIT and CHEMOSAT**\n\nDelcath Systems, Inc. is an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. The company's proprietary products, HEPZATO KIT™ (HEPZATO (melphalan) for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) and CHEMOSAT® Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP), are designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects during a PHP procedure.\n\nIn the United States, HEPZATO KIT is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated and approved for sale as a drug by the FDA. HEPZATO KIT is comprised of the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan and Delcath's proprietary Hepatic Delivery System (HDS). The HDS is used to isolate the hepatic venous blood from the systemic circulation while simultaneously filtrating hepatic venous blood during melphalan infusion and washout. The use of the HDS results in loco-regional delivery of a relatively high melphalan dose, which can potentially induce a clinically meaningful tumor response with minimal hepatotoxicity and reduce systemic exposure. HEPZATO KIT is approved in the United States as a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. Please see the full [Prescribing Information](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hepzatokit.com&esheet=54149460&newsitemid=20241108582249&lan=en-US&anchor=Prescribing+Information&index=3&md5=bfab61f75365448cfcdc23050690bfdc), including BOXED WARNING for the HEPZATO KIT.\n\nIn Europe, the device-only configuration of the HDS is regulated as a Class III medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used in the conduct of percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedures at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.\n\n**Safe Harbor / Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n _The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by the Company or on its behalf.

The company's proprietary products, HEPZATO KIT™ (Hepzato (melphalan) for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) and CHEMOSAT® Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP), are designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects during a PHP procedure.\n\nIn the United States, HEPZATO KIT is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated and approved for sale as a drug by the FDA. HEPZATO KIT is comprised of the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan and Delcath's proprietary Hepatic Delivery System (HDS). The HDS is used to surgically isolate the liver while simultaneously filtrating hepatic venous blood during melphalan infusion and washout. The use of the HDS results in loco-regional delivery of a relatively high melphalan dose, which can potentially induce a clinically meaningful tumor response with minimal hepatotoxicity and reduce systemic exposure. HEPZATO KIT is approved in the United States as a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. Please see the full [Prescribing Information](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hepzatokit.com&esheet=54139661&newsitemid=20241025856311&lan=en-US&anchor=Prescribing+Information&index=3&md5=871304b8fc20879cf8cbe9224d2efb57), including BOXED WARNING for the HEPZATO KIT.\n\nIn Europe, the device-only configuration of the HDS is regulated as a Class III medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used in the conduct of percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedures at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.\n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241025856311r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241025856311/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241025856311/en/)\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** ICR Healthcare investorrelations@delcath.com\n\nSource: Delcath Systems, Inc.\n\nSearch Investors\n\nSearch this site\n\nSubmit\n"
