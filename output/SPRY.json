(Nasdaq: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect themselves from allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, today reported early progress on the U.S. commercial launch of _**neffy ®**_ (epinephrine nasal spray) 2 mg for the treatment of Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adults and children who weigh ≥30 kg (66 lbs.), as well as business highlights and financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“The third quarter marked a transformative period for ARS Pharma, driven by the FDA approval of _**neffy**_ in the U.S. and the European Commission approval of _**EURneffy ®**_ in the European Union,” stated Richard Lowenthal, President and CEO of ARS Pharmaceuticals. “With strong demand among healthcare providers and patients for _**neffy**_ as the first and only needle-free epinephrine treatment, robust patient support systems in place, and favorable early payer discussions ongoing, we feel very good about the early momentum in our U.S. launch. We’re also proud to have further expanded the reach of _**neffy**_ outside the U.S. by partnering with ALK-Abelló, a global leader in allergy product commercialization. Operationally, we stand very well positioned with a balance sheet that is further strengthened by the $145 million upfront payment from ALK, positioning us to execute our U.S. commercial plans and business goals to enable patients around the world to have access to this vital epinephrine treatment.”\n\n _**U.S. commercial launch ongoing for neffy, the first and only needle-free epinephrine treatment for Type 1 allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis**_\n\nOn August 9, 2024, the FDA approved _**neffy ®**_ **(** epinephrine nasal spray) 2 mg for the treatment of Type 1 allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adults and children who weigh ≥30 kg (66 lbs.). _**neffy**_ was first available for shipment on September 23, 2024, and in early October, the U.S. sales force started in the field and _**neffy**_ became broadly available in retail pharmacies. Launch to date:\n\n  * More than 5,700 healthcare providers had been reached by the neffy sales force\n  * More than 1,700 healthcare providers submitted a prescription for _**neffy**_ , using BlinkRx through _**neffyConnect**_ , a service that provides patients access and co-pay support, as well as free at-home delivery;\n  * Of the physicians who prescribed _**neffy**_ , 80% were in the highest decile category;\n  * More than 1,000 allergists enrolled in the _**neffy**_ Experience Program, which enables physicians to administer _**neffy**_ during their in-clinic allergy food challenges; and,\n  * Product presentations and contract discussions with several of the key payors are underway, with initial coverage decisions expected by yearend. \n\n\n\nIn September 2024, ARS Pharma submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for  _**neffy**_ 1 mgfor the treatment of Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adults and children who weigh 15 to 30 kg (33-66 lbs.). In November 2024, the FDA granted the sNDA priority review and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of March 6, 2025. \n\n _**On-track with global strategy to make neffy ® available worldwide **_\n\nOn August 22, 2024, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for **EUR** _**neffy ®**_ (epinephrine nasal spray) for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) in adults and children who weigh ≥30 kg. On November 8, 2024, ARS Pharma announced an exclusive licensing agreement with ALK-Abelló to commercialize _**neffy**_ in Europe, Canada and certain other geographies outside the U.S. Under the terms of the agreement, ARS Pharma will receive an upfront payment of $145 million, and is eligible to receive up to an additional $320 million in sales, commercial and other milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties in the teens on net sales in the licensed territories.\n\nThe regulatory submission for approval in Australia has been filed by CSL Seqirus under its license agreement with ARS Pharma. In addition, regulatory submissions in both China and Japan are expected to be completed in November by the respective partners in those geographies. In December, ARS Pharma plans to file for regulatory submission in the United Kingdom and Canada on behalf of ALK-Abelló, and additional regulatory filings by ARS Pharma and ALK are anticipated in 2025 to further expand global patient reach with _**neffy**_.\n\n_**Clinical expansion of neffy ® for urticaria to begin in 2025**_\n\nARS Pharma plans to initiate an outpatient Phase 2b study of its intranasal epinephrine technology in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, a prevalent skin disease, who have been treated previously with antihistamines and experience frequent acute flares. The Phase 2b trial is expected to begin in early 2025, followed by a potential single pivotal efficacy trial.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Revenue:** Total revenue was $2.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, comprised of $0.6 million in net product revenue for _**neffy**_ sales, which reflects revenues from only one week following product launch in late September, and $1.5 million in collaboration revenue for the same period.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses: **R&D expenses were $4.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the majority of which is comprised of product manufacturing costs prior to the commercial launch of _**neffy**_ , other product development costs, and compensation costs.\n  * **Selling, General and Administrative (SG &A) Expenses: **SG&A expenses were $19.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which is mainly comprised of personnel expenses and costs associated with starting the commercial launch of _**neffy**_.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $19.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $204.6 million as of September 30, 2024.

In the absence of clinical improvement or if symptoms worsen after initial treatment, administer a second dose of _**neffy**_ in the same nostril with a new nasal spray starting 5 minutes after the first dose.\n\n_**neffy**_ is for use in the nose only.\n\nAdvise patients when to seek emergency medical assistance for close monitoring of the anaphylactic episode and in the event further treatment is required.\n\nAbsorption of _**neffy**_ may be affected by underlying structural or anatomical nasal conditions.\n\nAdminister with caution to patients who have heart disease; epinephrine may aggravate angina pectoris or produce ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have been reported, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac disease or taking cardiac glycosides, diuretics, or anti-arrhythmics.\n\nThe presence of a sulfite in _**neffy**_ should not deter use.\n\n_**neffy**_ may alter nasal mucosa for up to 2 weeks after administration and increase systemic absorption of nasal products, including _**neffy**_.\n\nPatients with certain medical conditions or who take certain medications for allergies, depression, thyroid disorders, diabetes, and hypertension, may be at greater risk for adverse reactions.\n\nEpinephrine can temporarily exacerbate the underlying condition or increase symptoms in patients with the following: hyperthyroidism, Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, renal impairment. Epinephrine should be administered with caution in patients with these conditions, including elderly patients and pregnant women.\n\nAdverse reactions to _**neffy**_ may include throat irritation, intranasal paresthesia, headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, paresthesia, fatigue, tremor, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, sneezing, abdominal pain, gingival pain, hypoesthesia oral, nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of _**neffy**_. To report suspected adverse reactions, contact ARS Pharmaceuticals Operations, Inc. at 1-877-MY-NEFFY (877-696-3339) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.\n\nFor additional information on _**neffy**_ , please see Full Prescribing Information at www._**neffy**_.com.\n\n**About Type I Allergic Reactions Including Anaphylaxis**\n\nType I allergic reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening events that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and require immediate treatment with epinephrine, the only FDA-approved medication for these reactions. While epinephrine autoinjectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation. These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. There are approximately 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I allergic reactions. Of this group, over the last three years, approximately 20 million people have been diagnosed and treated for severe Type I allergic reactions that may lead to anaphylaxis, but (in 2023, for example) only 3.2 million filled their active epinephrine autoinjector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed autoinjector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an autoinjector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency.\n\n**About Urticaria**\n\nUrticaria is a skin disorder that causes itchy hives and/or angioedema with an annualized incidence of 5 million in the U.S. About 40% of those cases become chronic urticaria, of which 50% are non-responsive to first-line antihistamine therapy. These non-responsive patients on stable therapy regimens can experience exacerbations or flares several times a year among acute cases, and even several times a week, including up to three or four emergency room visits per year. Angioedema is also a co-occurring symptom in about 33 to 67% of these patients. There are currently no approved community use treatments for acute flares experienced by urticaria patients on chronic regimens of antihistamines. ARS Pharmaceuticals is investigating _**neffy**_ for episodic symptomatic relief of these acute flares or exacerbations to improve the quality of life of urticaria patients. If _**neffy**_ is approved for this indication, patients would have the option to quickly resolve exacerbations or flares at home without escalating to chronic use of systemic biologics that may have more serious side effects and benefit-risk considerations or visiting the emergency room for further treatment.\n\n**About ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.**\n\nARS Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and their caregivers to better protect patients from allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis. The Company is commercializing  _**neffy ®**_ 2 mg (trade name **EUR** _**neffy ®**_ in the EU) (previously referred to as ARS-1), an epinephrine nasal spray indicated in the U.S. for emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adult and pediatric patients who weigh 30 kg or greater, and in the EU for emergency treatment of allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) due to insect stings or bites, foods, medicinal products, and other allergens as well as idiopathic or exercise induced anaphylaxis in adults and children who weigh 30 kg or greater.

(Nasdaq: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and their caregivers to better protect patients from allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, today announced a licensing agreement with ALK-Abelló A/S (“ALK”, Nasdaq: ALK B), that provides ALK exclusive rights to commercialize **_neffy_****®** (epinephrine nasal spray) (trade name **EUR**** _neffy_** ® in Europe), the first and only needle-free emergency treatment for Type I allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, in Europe, Canada and other geographies outside of the U.S. ARS Pharma retains all rights to **_neffy_** in the U.S., and there are no changes to its existing partnerships in Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n“ALK is a specialized pharmaceutical company and a global leader in the allergy field, serving millions of allergy patients across 46 countries. As a multi-billion-dollar, commercial leader with strong ties to regulators, healthcare practitioners and patients, ALK is the ideal partner to further accelerate and expand the global reach of **_neffy_** ,” said Richard Lowenthal, Co-Founder, President, and CEO of ARS Pharma. “This collaboration enhances our strategic agreements to better ensure that individuals who need **_neffy_** can access this innovative, needle-free treatment for Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Additionally, the capital from this agreement enables us to focus fully on our ongoing U.S. commercial launch of **_neffy_** , with significant operational flexibility. We are excited about **_neffy_** _'s_ future and our ability to positively impact the lives of millions, empowering patients and their caregivers to manage allergic reactions with confidence.”\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, ARS Pharma will receive an upfront payment of $145 million and is eligible to receive up to an additional $320 million in regulatory and sales milestones, as well as tiered, double-digit royalties in the teens on net sales in licensed geographies. ARS Pharma will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying **_neffy_** to ALK.\n\n“We are thrilled to partner with ARS Pharma, a company that shares our commitment to advancing transformative allergy solutions for patients. We have closely followed developments with **_neffy_** since ARS Pharma first demonstrated that safe, low-dose, injection-like delivery of epinephrine could be achieved through a nasal spray,” said Peter Halling, President and CEO of ALK. “We believe that nasal delivery of epinephrine could become an important new standard of care in anaphylaxis management over the next decade, as nasal delivery addresses the hesitation often associated with needle-based options. **_neffy_** offers strong scientific and commercial ties to our existing product portfolio and sales channels, and this licensing agreement is an important step in our strategic efforts to establish leading positions in anaphylaxis, food allergy, and other adjacent disease areas to supplement our core offering in respiratory allergy. We look forward to making this much-needed treatment accessible to patients.”\n\nIn August 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved **_neffy_** in the U.S. That same month, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for **EUR**** _neffy_** in the EU. ARS Pharma plans to file for regulatory approval in Canada by the end of 2024.\n\nARS Pharma is also evaluating its intranasal epinephrine technology for the treatment of acute flares in patients with chronic urticaria, with plans to being a Phase 2b clinical trial in early 2025. The license agreement with ALK also provides them exclusive rights for any new indications in the licensed territories.\n\n**About**** _neffy_**** _®_**** _neffy_** is an intranasal epinephrine product for patients with Type I allergic reactions including food, medications, and insect bites that could lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\nINDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR **_neffy_** (epinephrine nasal spray)\n\nINDICATION\n\n**_neffy_** 2 mg is indicated for emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adult and pediatric patients who weigh 30 kg or greater.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nIt is recommended that patients are prescribed and have immediate access to two **_neffy_** nasal sprays at all times.

These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. There are approximately 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I allergic reactions. Of this group, over the last three years, approximately 20 million people have been diagnosed and treated for Type I allergic reactions that may lead to anaphylaxis, but (in 2023, for example) only 3.2 million filled their active epinephrine autoinjector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed autoinjector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an autoinjector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency.\n\n**About ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.** ARS Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and their caregivers to better protect patients from allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis. The Company is commercializing ** _neffy_**** _®_** 2 mg (trade name **EUR**** _neffy_**** _®_** in the EU) (previously referred to as ARS-1), an epinephrine nasal spray indicated in the US for emergency treatment of Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adult and pediatric patients who weigh 30 kg or greater, and in the EU for emergency treatment of allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) due to insect stings or bites, foods, medicinal products, and other allergens as well as idiopathic or exercise induced anaphylaxis in adults and children who weigh 30 kg or greater.

These statements include, but are not limited to: ARS Pharma’s belief that the license agreement with ALK-Abelló will accelerate and further expand the global reach of **_neffy_** ; ARS Pharma’s plans regarding regulatory submissions in Canada, the United Kingdom, China, Japan and Australia; the needle-free profile of **_neffy_** increasing the likelihood that patients will both carry and administer adrenaline; and other statements that are not historical fact. Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Words such as “could,” “enables,” “ideal,” “excited,” “look forward,” “plans,” “will,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon ARS Pharma’s current expectations and involve assumptions that may never materialize or may prove to be incorrect. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation: ARS Pharma’s reliance on ALK-Abelló for the commercialization of **_neffy_** outside the United States in previously unpartnered territories; the potential that ARS Pharma may not receive milestone payments or royalty payments under the ALK-Abelló license agreement in the amounts and at the times expected, if at all; potential safety and other complications from **_neffy_** ; the labelling for **_neffy_** in any future indication or patient population, if approved; the scope, progress and expansion of developing and commercializing **_neffy_** ; the potential for payors to delay, limit or deny coverage for **_neffy_** ; the size and growth of the market therefor and the rate and degree of market acceptance thereof vis-à-vis intramuscular injectable products; ARS Pharma’s ability to protect its intellectual property position; and the impact of government laws and regulations. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” in ARS Pharma’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 6, 2024.
