The\nCompany has strong cash ($3.6 million) and book equity ($4 million) positions, with no debt, roughly 840 thousand\nshares and good visibility on aircraft deliveries. Today is an important day for Jet.AI in its continued mission to build\nshareholder value and we thank all those who have contributed to our return to compliance.\"\nAs previously disclosed, the Company received a letter on December 1, 2023, notifying the Company that its amount of\nstockholders' equity had fallen below the $10 million minimum stockholders' equity requirement (the \"Minimum Equity\nRequirement\"). The Company's stockholders' deficit as of December 31, 2023, was $(3,963,039). The notification of\nnoncompliance had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's Common Stock.\nInitially, the Company had 180 calendar days, or until May 29, 2024, to regain compliance with the Minimum Equity\nRequirement. Although the Company did not regain compliance with the Minimum Equity Requirement by May 29,\n2024, the Nasdaq Hearings Panel determined to provide the Company until November 26, 2024, to regain compliance\nwith the Minimum Equity Requirement after the Company elected to transfer the listing of its Common Stock to The\nNasdaq Capital Market on August 14, 2024. To regain compliance, the minimum stockholders' equity of the Company\nmust meet or exceed $2.5 million.\nSince the Nasdaq Hearings Panel provided the Company with an extended time period to regain compliance with the\nMinimum Equity Requirement, the Company has completed the following transactions listed in the Form 8-K filed on\nNovember 18, 2024, which can be viewed here on Jet.AI's EDGAR page.\nAs a result of these transactions described in the Form 8-K filed on November 18, 2024, and with approximately $4.0\nmillion in shareholders' equity and cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 million, the Company believes it has stockholders'\nequity above the $2.5 million Minimum Equity Requirement. Therefore, the Company believes it has regained\ncompliance with the Minimum Equity Requirement. As of November 18, 2024, there were 839,733 shares of the\nCompany's common stock, par value $0.0001, issued and outstanding.\nAbout Jet.AI\nJet.AI operates in two segments, Software and Aviation, respectively.

          "content": "Jet.AI Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nLAS VEGAS, Nov. 14, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jet.AI (the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: JTAI), an innovative\nprivate aviation and artificial intelligence (\"AI\") company, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights\nAuthorized $2 million share repurchase program and withdrawal of S-1 registration statement\nAnnounced reverse stock split\nParticipated in Corporate Jet Investor Miami 2024\nAnnounced new features and advancements to CharterGPT and Reroute AI\nParticipated in the 2024 NBAA Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition\nOpened new JetLeg.AI app to Beta Testers\nAnnounced updates around proprietary software solutions\nEntered into warrant amendments after successful warrant exchange offer and consent solicitation\nLaunched DynoFlight 2.0 platform, an advanced AI web-based solution for aviation carbon management\nCompleted exchange offer and consent solicitation relating to its outstanding warrants\nManagement Commentary\nJet.AI Chairman and CEO Mike Winston commented, \"We're seeing strength across our business, with improvements\nin our key financial metrics both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. To make our earnings more predictable, we\nentered an agreement with Textron Aviation to purchase three Cessna Citation CJ4 jets, which will be delivered in\nstages-one each in the first, second, and fourth quarters of 2026. This order complements a proposed fleet deal with\nBombardier for Challenger 3500 jets, which would be expected a year later in the first, second and third quarters of\n2027, respectively. Our plan is to pre-sell shares in fleet aircraft to customers before delivery, maintaining a 'capital-light'\nmodel in private aviation by reducing upfront costs.\"\n\"We've authorized a share buyback, completed a reverse split and pulled a Form S-1 due to its heavy warrant structure.\nOn a related note, we also filed an S-3 as a continuation of our previously disclosed transaction with Ionic Ventures\nLLC. The Company now expects to regain compliance with NASDAQ's listing standards by the November 26th\ndeadline.\"\nWinston also spoke about advancing CharterGPT, the company's AI-based booking technology. \"Over the next few\nquarters, we aim to develop CharterGPT into an 'AI agent' that can handle both the customer-facing and backend\naspects of the booking process independently, returning results without extensive human oversight. Expanding sales by\nhiring more charter brokers isn't particularly interesting to us, but expanding sales by using AI brokers with only the\nmost crucial moments of human involvement is very interesting. Testing this approach is relatively low-cost and may\nreveal a product market fit for AI-driven sales.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nRevenues were $3.9 million, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the same period last year and $0.8 million\ncompared to the prior quarter. The primary reason for the increase was due to additional service revenue arising from\nthe Company entering into an agreement to manage a second customer aircraft in the second quarter of 2024.\nSoftware App and Cirrus Charter revenue, the gross amount of charters booked through CharterGPT and Cirrus,\nwas $2.4 million, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the same period last year.\nManagement and Other Services revenue, which is comprised of revenues generated from managing and chartering\nour customer aircrafts, totaled $960,000 compared to $775,000 in the same period last year.\nJet Card and Fractional Programs revenue, which is generated from the sale and use of jet cards and service\nrevenue related to ongoing utilization by the Company's fractional customers, totaled $547,000 compared to $732,000 in\nthe same period last year.\nCost of revenues totaled $3.9 million compared to $3.2 million in the same period last year. The increase is primarily\ndue to an increase in Cirrus charter flight activity, costs related to the operation of aircraft and payments to Cirrus for\ntheir management.\nGross loss totaled approximately $14,000 compared to a gross profit of $170,000 in the same period last year and\ngross loss of $417,000 in the prior quarter. The result was largely driven by reduced flights performed for the\nCompany's jet card customers without a corresponding reduction in fixed costs.\nOperating expenses totaled $2.9 million compared to $4.4 million in the same period last year. The decrease was\nprimarily due to the improvement in general and administrative, sales & marketing, and research & development\nexpenses.\nOperating loss decreased to approximately $2.9 million compared to $4.3 million in the same period last year and $3.2\nmillion in the prior quarter. The improvement was primarily due to the aforementioned reasons above.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $312,000 compared to\n$528,000 as of June 30, 2024, and $2.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of today, November 14th, 2024.\nAbout Jet.AI\nJet.AI operates in two segments, Software and Aviation, respectively.

          "content": "Jet.AI's Board of Directors Authorizes $2 Million Share Repurchase Program and\nWithdrawal of S-1 Registration Statement\nLAS VEGAS, Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jet.AI Inc. (\"Jet.AI\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:\nJTAI), an innovative private aviation and artificial intelligence company, announced today that its board of directors has\napproved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $2 million of its common stock\nthrough December 31st, 2025.\nUnder the stock repurchase program, the Company may buy back its common stock from time to time, in amounts, at\nprices, and at such times as the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and federal and state laws governing such transactions, through a variety of\nmethods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share\nrepurchase transactions, purchases through 10b5-1 trading plans, or by any combination of such methods. The\nrepurchase program does not oblige the Company to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified,\ndiscontinued, or suspended at any time.\nIn connection with this, Jet.AI has decided to withdraw a S-1 registration statement (SEC File No. 333-281911) for a\nprospective offering that the Company was previously pursuing. After careful consideration, the Company determined\nthat the offering terms contemplated within that S-1 were no longer in the best interests of the Company and its\nstockholders, and are not aligned with the Company's current strategic objectives and growth plans. Jet.AI expects to\nreturn to compliance with the NASDAQ's listing rule related to stockholders' equity in the absence of the offering\ncontemplated by theS-1 ,and further expects to file a moot notice with Nasdaq in advance of the November 26th\ndeadline the exchange imposed on the Company to regain compliance.\n\"This share repurchase program allows the company to buy shares when we view them as undervalued - particularly in\nperiods of market dislocation,\" said Jet.AI Chairman and CEO Mike Winston. \"Additionally, because we recently\nsucceeded in exchanging our publicly held warrants for stock to simplify the capital structure - we're glad to pull this\npreviously contemplated warrant heavy transaction, which is no longer necessary given the company's position.\"\nAbout Jet.AI\nJet.AI operates in two segments, Software and Aviation, respectively. The Software segment features the B2C\nCharterGPT app and the B2B Jet.AI Operator platform. The CharterGPT app uses natural language processing and\nmachine learning to improve the private jet booking experience.

Statements that are not historical are forward-looking statements within the\nmeaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events or our future performance or future financial condition. These\nforward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and\nprojections about our Company, our industry, our beliefs and our assumptions. These forward-looking statements\ngenerally are identified by the words \"believe,\" \"project,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"strategy,\" \"future,\"\n\"opportunity,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"will be,\" \"will continue,\" \"will likely result,\" and similar expressions\nor the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, but the absence of these words does not mean that a\nstatement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about\nfuture events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and\nuncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results. As a result, caution must\nbe exercised in relying on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they were made. Factors that\ncould cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements can be\nfound in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, , and subsequent reports filed by the Company with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, as such factors may be further updated from time to time in the Company's\nperiodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. These filings identify and\naddress other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those\ncontained in the forward-looking statements.\nNew risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the\nimpact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks,\nuncertainties, and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this press release may not\noccur, and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nReaders are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only\nas of the date they are made, and Jet.AI assumes no obligation and does not intend to update or revise these forward-\nlooking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as provided by law.\nContacts:\nGateway Group, Inc.\n949-574-3860\nJet.AI@gateway-grp.com\n11/13/2024 9:45:00 AM"
