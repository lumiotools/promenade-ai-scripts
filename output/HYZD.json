We advise you to consider the Fund’s\nobjectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus or summary prospectus contains this and other important information about\nthe Fund. Read the prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus carefully before you invest. Call 866.909.WISE (9473) or go to WisdomTree.com/\ninvestments for more information.\nThere are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. High-yield or \"junk” bonds have lower credit ratings and involve a greater risk to\nprincipal. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. The Fund seeks to mitigate interest\nrate risk by taking short positions in U.S. Treasuries, but there is no guarantee this will be achieved. Derivative investments can be volatile and these investments\nmay be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Fixed income investments are also subject to credit\nrisk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner, or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such\npayments will cause the price of that bond to decline. The Fund may engage in \"short sale” transactions where losses may be exaggerated, potentially losing\nmore money than the actual cost of the investment and the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund. While the\nFund attempts to limit credit and counterparty exposure, the value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning in response to issuer or\ncounterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Fund’s portfolio investments. Due to the investment strategy of certain Fund’s they may make\nhigher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.

For each bond, it also addresses that interest rate changes can alter expected bond future cash flows through embedded options.\nThe calculation is also expanded to incorporate the contribution of derivatives to the overall interest rate risk sensitivity to the portfolio.\nEmbedded Income Yield:The annualized rate of return generated by a Fund's investment in both fixed income securities and derivatives exclusive of interest rate\nchanges and movement in foreign exchange spot rates. The calculation is intended to capture the Fund's potential to earn income return over the following year\ngiven current holdings and market conditions. The embedded income yield will differ from the portfolio's yield to maturity, due to the incorporation of\nderivatives in the embedded income yield. Embedded income yield and portfolio yield to maturity may differ from a Funds actual distribution and SEC yield and\ndo not reflect Fund expenses.\nCredit ratings apply to the underlying holdings of the Fund, not to the Fund itself. Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s study the financial condition of an entity to\nascertain its creditworthiness. The credit ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of the holdings’ financial condition and histories. The ratings displayed are\nbased on the highest of each portfolio constituent as currently rated by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Long-term ratings are generally measured on a scale\nranging from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), while short-term ratings are generally measured on a scale ranging from A-1 to C.\nFund Distribution Yield:is calculated by annualizing the most recent Fund distribution and dividing by the Fund's current NAV. The yield represents a single\ndistribution from the Fund and does not represent the total returns of the Fund.\nSEC 30-Day Yield:reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the Fund's expenses. This is also referred to as the\n\"standardized yield.\" Unsubsidized SEC-30 day yield does not reflect fee waivers in effect.\nYield To Maturity: Portfolio Yield to Maturity represents the weighted average yield to maturity of a Fund's investments in money market securities and short-term\nfixed income securities as of a specified date. Yield to maturity is the rate of return generated on a fixed income instrument assuming interest payments and\ncapital gains or losses as if the instrument is held to maturity. The weighted average yield is calculated based on the market value of each fixed-income\ninvestment. The calculation does not incorporate yield from any currency forward contracts that might be part of the Fund's investments.\nData Source: WisdomTree, S&P, Bloomberg.\nWisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC, in the U.S.\n©2024 WisdomTree, Inc. \"WisdomTree\" and the company logo are registered trademarks of WisdomTree, Inc.\nWisdomTree.com/investments"

          "content": "WisdomTree Interest Rate Hedged\nHYZD\nHigh Yield Bond Fund\nAfter historical quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve and the rise in interest rates, income is back in Fixed\nIncome once again and High Yield securities are an integral income producing part of investors’ portfolios. Even\nthough the outlook for interest rates trajectory is more balanced, we believe interest rate hedges continue to\nprovide a great tool in an investors arsenal in reducing interest rate risk to focus on High Yield sector’s specific\nfundamentals.\nThe WisdomTree Interest Rate Hedged High Yield Bond Fund (HYZD) seeks to track the price and yield\nperformance, before fees and expenses, of the WisdomTree U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond, Zero Duration Index.\nHYZD offers investors strategic exposure to the high-yield corporate bond market while reducing their overall\nexposure to interest rate (duration) risk1. We employ our fundamental screening and income tilting process to\nisolate attractive bonds with strong income characteristics and then offset these exposures with targeted short\npositions in Treasury securities and futures. By bundling this style of approach to portfolio management in an\nexchange-traded fund (ETF), we believe that this product may provide investors with another strategy to help\nreduce the interest rate risk of their overall portfolio.\nA History of Interest Rates and Drivers of Return\nHigh-Yield Spread: The difference between yields on high-yield bonds as represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index2.\nCredit Spread: The portion of a bond's yield that compensates investors for taking credit risk.\nBasis Point (bps): 1/100th of 1 percent.\nYield to Maturity: The total returns of a bond received by an investor when a bond is held to maturity.\nU.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield: The yield to maturity of a generic U.S. 10-year Treasury Bond.\nPast performance is not indicative of future results.\nYou cannot invest directly in an index.\n1 Interest rate risk: The risk that an investment’s value will decline due to an increase in interest rates.\n2 Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index: Covers the universe of fixed-rate, non-investment-grade corporate debt.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nHYZD WisdomTree Interest Rate Hedged High Yield Bond Fund 2\nChanges in Rising Rate Periods\n6/30/2004 - 12/30/2008 - 10/7/2010 - 5/2/2013 - 7/8/2016 - 7/31/2020 -\n6/28/2006 6/10/2009 12/15/2010 9/5/2013 11/8/2018 10/31/2023\nU.S. 5 YR\n146 148 99 120 214 465\nTreasury\nChange in Yield\n(bps)\nU.S. 10 YR\n66 189 115 137 188 440\nTreasury\nInvestment\n-22 -250 -26 -19 -58 -16\nGrade Bonds\nChange in Spread over\nTreasuries (bps)\nHigh Yield Bonds -73 -870 -83 9 -232 -53\nSources: Bloomberg, WisdomTree, as of 6/30/2024. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You cannot invest directly in an index.\nHigh-yield and investment grade bonds represented by the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index and Bloomberg U.S. Corporate\nInvestment Grade Index.\nThe WisdomTree U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond, Zero Duration Index\nThe WisdomTree U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond, Zero Duration Index, tracks the performance of a combination\nof a long position in a strategic exposure to U.S. high-yield bonds issued by U.S.-publicly domiciled companies\nand a short position in on-the-run3 U.S. Treasury securities4 where the net interest rate exposure of the Index is\nadjusted to a zero-year duration.\nThe long position is generated through a multi-step process that first screens the universe of high-yield debt\nissued by U.S.-domiciled public issuers to find those with a long-term history of generating positive free cash flow5.\nA risk-adjusted income score for each selected bond is calculated by our risk model. This score is then used to tilt\nthe market weight of the bond within its sector. This portion of the Index is identical to our WisdomTree U.S. High\nYield Corporate Bond Index6 and rebalanced semi-annually in May and November.\nINDEX COMPONENTS\nLong Portfolio Bonds included in the WisdomTree U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond Index.\nComprises short positions in U.S. Treasury Securities with an aggregate\nShort Portfolio\nduration of 0 years. The portfolio will be rebalanced on a monthly basis.\nImpact of Zero Duration Allocations in Investor Portfolios\nWhen incorporated into a core fixed income portfolio, HYZD may offer several positive attributes in mitigating\ninterest rate risk. The off-setting interest rate exposure of the short positions in nominal7 Treasury securities could\noffer a significant reduction in the interest rate risk of the overall portfolio, as seen in the next chart. Also, should\nthere be an improvement in the U.S. economy, the various issuers' credit fundamentals may improve, driving\ndown credit spreads and possibly resulting in price appreciation in the bonds.\n3 “On-the-run” Treasuries are the most recently issued U.S. Treasury bonds or notes of a particular maturity. On-the-run Treasuries are the\nopposite of \"off-the-run\" Treasuries, which refer to Treasury securities that have been issued before the most recent issue and are still\noutstanding.\n4 U.S. Treasury security: A debt security issued by the U.S. government.\n5 Free cash flow: A measure of how much cash is left in the company after taking into account all the necessary expenses, including net\ncapital expenditures.\n6 WisdomTree U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond Index* is a rule-based alternatively weighted Index designed to capture the performance of\nselected issuers in the U.S. high-yield corporate bond market that are deemed to have attractive fundamental and income characteristics.\n7 Rate on the Treasury security not adjusted for inflation.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\nHYZD WisdomTree Interest Rate Hedged High Yield Bond Fund 3\nSo how does the Fund work? HYZD essentially combines a long position in cash bonds from the\nWisdomTree U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond Index with a short position in Treasury securities and/or\nTreasury futures to target the zero-duration exposure. Investors can use the portfolio as a stand-alone\ntool for combatting rising interest rates or as a means of mitigating interest rate risk associated with\nother interest rate sensitive assets in their portfolio.\nWisdomTree.com/investments\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n.0\n.0\n.0\n.0\n.0\n.0\n2 .4 Y e a\nL o\nrs D u\nn g P\nra tio\no r t f\nn\no\n-2 .4\nlio +\nY e\nS\na rs\nh o\nD\nr\nu ra\nt P\ntio n\no r t f o\n0 Y e\nlio\na\n=\nrs D u\nH Y\nra tio n\nZ D 8 0 % E\n5\nx\n.5\nis\nY e a\nit in\nrs D\ng E\nu\nx\nra tio n\np o s u r\n0\ne\nY\n+\ne a\n2\nrs D\n0 %\nu ra tio\nH Y Z\nn\nD =\n4 .4\nN\nY\ne\ne\nt\na rs\nE x\nD\np\nu\no\nra tio n\ns u r e\nHYZD Construction and Overall Portfolio Exposures\nExample on left: Long portfolio: WisdomTree U.S. High Yield Corporate Bond Index. Short portfolio: Short position in U.S. Treasury securities.\nExample on right: Hypothetical example of what may happen when adding HYZD to an existing portfolio with a duration of 5.5 years. The\nresult (aqua box) is a reduction of overall portfolio duration to 4.4 years. Source: WisdomTree, as of 6/30/24.\nPotential Trade-Offs\nAlthough the Fund seeks to target a duration of zero years, a rate increase of 100 basis points does not necessarily\nguarantee a zero impact on the price of the Fund. Given its investments in non-investment grade bonds, the Fund\nwill be adversely impacted by a deterioration in credit quality8. Also, it may be possible that the targeted short\nexposure does not completely mitigate the interest rate exposure of the long bond positions. Additionally, should\nrates remain constant (or fall), the strategy may underperform a long-only portfolio.

For a prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus containing this and other\nimportant information about the fund, call 866.909.9473 or visit WisdomTree.com/investments. Read the\nprospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus carefully before investing.\nThere are risks associated with investing, including the possible loss of principal. High-yield or “junk” bonds have\nlower credit ratings and involve a greater risk to principal. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate\nrisk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. The Fund seeks to mitigate interest rate risk by taking\nshort positions in U.S. Treasuries, but there is no guarantee this will be achieved. Derivative investments can be\nvolatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied\neconomic conditions.\nFixed income investments are also subject to credit risk, the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest\nand principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will\ncause the price of that bond to decline. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions where losses may be\nexaggerated, potentially losing more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the third party to the\nshort sale may fail to honor its contract terms, causing a loss to the Fund. While the Fund attempts to limit credit\nand counterparty exposure, the value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning in\nresponse to issuer or counterparty defaults and changes in the credit ratings of the Fund’s portfolio investments.\nDue to the investment strategy of certain Funds, they may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.\nPlease read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.\nWisdomTree Funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.\n© 2024 WisdomTree, Inc. “WisdomTree\" is a registered mark of WisdomTree, Inc.\nWTGM-1338\nWisdomTree.com/investments"
