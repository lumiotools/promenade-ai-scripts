The new reference site will showcase Zapp’s flexible manufacturing and Gen-2 sustainable assembly innovations, and completion is expected by early 2025. It will also serve as a template for Zapp to roll out an anticipated series of such proprietary sites around the world that can be operated by any number of contract manufacturers, each with an annualized production capacity of up to 20,000 units and located in regions where Zapp sees significant sales growth potential.\n\n**Swin Chatsuwan, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Zapp EV** , said: “Zapp is poised to scale rapidly worldwide in the coming years. Now that Zapp has commenced sales of i300 in Thailand, opening the new low-cost manufacturing reference site in the Bangkok Free Trade Zone brings benefits for both domestic sales and exports. AIH Group adds a wealth of expertise from operating its own contract manufacturing facility and at other locations around the world with well-known automotive brands. Working with AIH Group on this project is the first of our many planned flexible facilities that can be operated by contract manufacturers and replicated in more locations worldwide and closer to the urban markets that the i300 was designed for.\n\n“Being able to personalise your i300 is incredibly important and often means each one is built to order. Reducing the time spent in transit between assembly and the customer’s doorstep adds to the ‘Gen-2 sustainabilty’ credentials of the i300, and means that our planned drop-ship-direct-to-customer model will see customers on their bikes in a shorter timeframe.”\n\n**Corrie Kotze, Chief Executive Officer of AIH Group** , added: “We have worked with many leading automotive OEMs, including BMW, Ford, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz, and we’ve been impressed by the Zapp team and the quality of i300’s design. With the added expertise that we bring, we look forward to supporting Zapp and accelerating its business plan in an effort to over-deliver on both its near- and long-term goals.”\n\n**About Zapp EV**\n\nZapp EV (Nasdaq: ZAPP) and its operating subsidiaries are run by a team of experts from the mobility industry, on a mission to redefine the electric two-wheeler segment. Zapp's debut product, the i300, is an urban electric high-performance two-wheeler capable of traditional motorcycle levels of performance in a step-through format, combining ease of use with exhilaration and fun. The i300 is the first in a suite of high-performance electric two-wheelers that Zapp plans to bring to market. Zapp will offer a high-quality direct-to-customer experience known as DSDTC (drop-ship-direct-to-customer). Customers ordering the i300 online will have their bikes conveniently delivered to their home by authorised “Zappers,” who will provide at-home inspection, service and support throughout the vehicle ownership lifecycle.

First customer deliveries are expected in the months ahead.\n\n**Swin Chatsuwan, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Zapp EV** , said: “Vehicle homologation in Thailand is another important step forward for Zapp, which activates the commercial launch in our first Southeast Asian country. Thailand is one of the largest and most mature markets for two-wheelers in the region. An estimated 87% of households in the country owns at least one two-wheeler. And as a leader market, around half of consumers now purchase premium models similar to those bought by Europeans.\n\n“We believe i300’s nine-time award-winning design and high performance makes it a perfect proposition for global markets that are already dominated by urban step-throughs, with consumers looking to switch to electric. We look forward to our first customer deliveries in Thailand and to further commercial launches in other key Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia and Vietnam. There are nearly 500 million two wheelers on the road in Southeast Asia and India, and these regions collectively comprise more than half of annual two-wheeler sales globally.”\n\n**About Zapp EV**\n\nZapp EV (Nasdaq: ZAPP) and its operating subsidiaries are run by a team of experts from the mobility industry, on a mission to redefine the electric two-wheeler segment.
