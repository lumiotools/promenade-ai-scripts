The decrease was primarily due to decreases in recruiting expenses, commercial-related expenses, and various other general and administrative expenses. These were partially offset by an increase in compensation expenses for G&A employees.\n\n\n  * **Net Income/Loss:** Net loss was $45.4 million, or net loss of $1.05 per basic and diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $32.2 million, or a net loss of $0.90 per basic and diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net loss was $90.7 million, or net loss of $2.29 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of $82.1 million, or a net loss of $2.30 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About iTeos Therapeutics, Inc.** iTeos Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of a new generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics for patients. iTeos Therapeutics leverages its deep understanding of tumor immunology and immunosuppressive pathways to design novel product candidates with the potential to restore the immune response against cancer. The Company’s innovative pipeline includes three clinical-stage programs targeting novel, validated immunosuppressive pathways designed with optimized pharmacologic properties for improved clinical outcomes, including the TIGIT/CD226 axis and the adenosine pathway. iTeos Therapeutics is headquartered in Watertown, MA with a research center in Gosselies, Belgium.\n\n**About Belrestotug (EOS-448/** **GSK4428859A)** Belrestotug is an Fc active human immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting T cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domains (TIGIT), an important inhibitory receptor which contributes to the suppression of adaptive and innate immune responses against cancer. As an optimized high-affinity, potent anti-TIGIT mAb, belrestotug is designed to enhance the antitumor response through a multifaceted immune modulatory mechanism by engaging with TIGIT and FcγR, a key regulator of immune responses which induces cytokine release and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The therapeutic candidate is progressing in multiple indications in collaboration with GSK. \n\n**About Inupadenant (EOS-850)** Inupadenant is a next-generation small molecule antagonist targeting adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), the primary receptor on immune cells whose activation by adenosine suppresses innate and adaptive immune cell responses leading to inhibition of antitumor responses. Optimized for potency, high selectivity of A2AR, and activity at high adenosine concentrations in solid tumors, inupadenant is uniquely designed with its insurmountable profile to inhibit the ATP-adenosine pathway and has the potential for enhanced antitumor activity as compared to other A2AR antagonists in clinical development. The therapeutic candidate is in Phase 2 development. \n\n**About EOS-984** EOS-984 is a potential first-in-class small molecule targeting equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) designed to inhibit the immunosuppressive activity of adenosine and restore immune cell proliferation. The therapeutic candidate has the potential to fully reverse the profound immunosuppressive action of adenosine on T and B cells and is in Phase 1 development.\n\n**Internet Posting of Information** iTeos routinely posts information that may be important to investors in the 'Investors' section of its website at [ _www.iteostherapeutics.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=w5lW19nkMW2JmzpHP5Iy2XPPvqQJzedFz8cak8U142hFAllVT5dgNJET6AOEfLhdYBs5myQo8LrhZEJ1cFKK1wp52lI9CWpmGiFjmK7nVYSZ05ScgNwjYjwwBzs38V4WqR87k4YBz2w3Ej3zoZKoiA8qVkl9slvsCmLrnTbga2XLbLUtvKb8_AFSAHJl9UKq2C1e511Ny1J1vZK3P40Qke7A3QJIpcuJdbGQiVC-F4FOVXwuRf9qpi6GkBGm4gSznMH_cjwVyjKcysqv_vBwW2TGyLUX5VIuwe2EHZxzlC9QZAxiHriMS8JxFDxgQLFCBVca5UdCWd-qdzoe4SJOZ24U_qVQzOgdZoNV6FaV6hIIpawF3KCGZ2u_MkHZ4E7FXITKwiMwW2kmgk643nQTGKJaPLWozl8QP_qR0XsGcxF1fTJuGNK_cdX65BQzuAGIa-wnmXy2WoDef0XGg7R3mAtSvFiGYRiq07nReadVsHl7enPpLYNKr_SoYaaUNi17df3nOn74aH_81q8z4CUMWt7o7aRNQ-6Ryh3joOLIFVezX5L_EeBYFTthYz25Er4pGje-hb0xf7x83d5UJzG8bIGge0ScW4tlRvEq34Joq_hBbh0Gn7tWD-Ri2E5hGPH120Eogm2Bi6UPSltwHU3CFAKCT-i4QmHmM4yTUIYPSj6ZXGi3C-J9irQAnLnlNKgFAYcuF2FHASAw8XA_hr7-I2A326R5hG0b4ACAQCLevqjjEi7oQ_6AsDlVZ5JJnIpzhBLWw-PwbJVOPvb8xS-hZV9119MdY_TOk6XS2llXHd4=).
