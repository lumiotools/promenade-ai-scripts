(Nasdaq: LUNR, LUNRW) (“Intuitive Machines”) (“Company”), a leading space exploration, infrastructure, and services company, has announced it has entered into a Cooperation Agreement with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (“APL”) to advance safe, secure, and reliable lunar communications and navigation infrastructure in cislunar space. Cislunar space encompasses the region of space that extends from Earth’s gravitational influence to the Moon’s surface, including its orbit out to over 2 million kilometers distance.\n\nUnder the agreement, Johns Hopkins University APL intends to collaborate with Intuitive Machines to determine if there are potential hardware applications that could benefit of the United States. Intuitive Machines may adapt these advancements for commercial use, furthering its leadership in the cislunar economy.\n\n“This partnership is the leap toward establishing safe, secure, and reliable communications and navigation around the Moon, an area where we believe technology advancement is needed,” said Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus. “APL has a strong history of advancing solutions to critical challenges in defense, national security and space exploration. We’re excited to combine APL’s innovation with Intuitive Machines’ proven cislunar expertise.”\n\n“Cislunar space is of critical importance to our nation,” said Bobby Braun, head of APL’s Space Exploration Sector. “The combined technical strength of Johns Hopkins APL and Intuitive Machines holds the promise to dramatically accelerate the achievement of America’s scientific, exploration and security objectives in cislunar space.”\n\nThis partnership further advances Intuitive Machines’ vision for building cislunar infrastructure, providing a critical foundation for space domain awareness, data transmission, and navigation services. These efforts align with the Company’s [Near Space Network Services contract](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7mAa0EHmh6jEZ4t7CYTxtEae0w-6-WV_XZHLj-1rWFY_xAZwsmMUbkfZlSQ4V6B8jRbfsJjqJoC0BL8Ee7bDaFB0cLDJOKTbmMnhodxII8-06_WbjsdBN4R7nUuA56xv4l64kgdxv0LYYvx0J3WyhAgnxwX7S9YCaeT4crpKnsw_8h0qH5muX8dOp58R-sItZWN7FD88Fj6_N7QOaxnb6_ez0LRPZkZ5faON0CJYSCXDIWYPGbuh6hcgWhrtc28S-FI3BG0uZwG3bJ89ryBS_A==) with NASA to deploy a constellation of lunar data relay and navigation satellites around the Moon. The lunar constellation is central to Intuitive Machines’ strategy to commercialize the Moon, supporting international customers, commercial ventures, and NASA’s Artemis campaign. The contract introduces a pay-by-the-minute service model focused on scalable data transmission and navigation services, a significant step that the Company believes will boost margin potential through a subscription-like revenue model.\n\n**About Intuitive Machines**\n\nIntuitive Machines is a diversified space exploration, infrastructure, and services company focused on fundamentally disrupting lunar access economics. In 2024, Intuitive Machines successfully landed the Company’s Nova-C class lunar lander, Odysseus, on the Moon, returning the United States to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972. The Company’s products and services are offered through its four in-space business units: Lunar Access Services, Orbital Services, Lunar Data Services, and Space Products and Infrastructure.

(Nasdaq: LUNR, “Intuitive Machines,” or the “Company”), a leading space exploration, infrastructure, and services company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nIntuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus said, “Intuitive Machines had a very strong third quarter highlighted by key wins, revenue growth, and the largest cash balance in Company history. Throughout the quarter, we continued to focus on our three core service pillars: delivery, data transmission, and infrastructure as services. These pillars provide foundational capabilities that enable the missions and goals of commercial and government exploration of the Moon.”\n\n**Q3 Highlights**\n\n  * _Awarded $116.9 million contract through NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative, marking Intuitive Machines’ fourth contract award, more than any other CLPS vendor_\n  *  _Sole awardee of Near Space Network (NSN) data services contract from NASA with a maximum potential value of $4.82 billion, a transformative step for Intuitive Machines in data transmission for in-space communications and navigation_\n  *  _Completed vehicle propulsion system hot fire for Intuitive Machines’ second lunar mission, representing the most complex integrated test of the vehicle, in preparation for a Q1 launch from the Kennedy Space Center_\n  *  _Achieved_ _$58.5 million_ _of revenue in Q3, up_ _359%__YoY;__$173.3 million_ _year to date, more than double all of 2023_\n  *  _Improved profitability with_ _$4.1 million_ _of positive gross margin in Q3_\n  *  _Ended Q3 with_ _$89.6 million_ _in cash, the highest quarter ending cash balance in Company history_\n  *  _Reported record backlog of_ _$316.2 million_ _, the highest quarter ending backlog in Company history driven primarily by Intuitive Machines’ fourth NASA CLPS award; backlog does not yet include the full $150 million of initial task orders for Near Space Network data services_\n\n\n\nMr. Altemus continued, “We made progress across all three pillars by first securing another south pole lunar delivery mission, then winning the Near Space Network Services contract, and finally, continuing to mature both our LTV design in conjunction with our heavy cargo class lander. These strategic revenue streams bring our business thesis clearly into view, allowing us to focus on capturing more operational services, which we believe will provide long-tail revenues with higher margins.”\n\nIntuitive Machines CFO Pete McGrath said, “As demonstrated in the quarter, we continue to execute on current programs while winning key awards. I look forward to guiding the Company through a new lens as CFO and focus on managing costs efficiently to drive towards profitability and achieve our financial targets.”\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\n  * We are narrowing our full-year 2024 revenue outlook to $215 - $235 million and are trending towards the mid-point\n  * Current cash balance of $106.9 million as of month end October, coupled with our strong visibility into the timing of collections for contracted milestone payments, gives us confidence that we will end the year with a similar cash balance\n  * We expect backlog expansion driven by key potential upcoming awards such as Near Space Network 1.2 / 1.3 Direct to Earth, LTVS Phase 2, among others, coupled with task orders for OMES and Near Space Network 2.2 - Cislunar Relay\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nIntuitive Machines will host a conference call today, November 14, 2024, at 8:30 am Eastern Time to discuss these results. A link to the live webcast of the earnings conference call will be made available on the investors portion of the Intuitive Machines’ website at https://investors.intuitivemachines.com.\n\nFollowing the conference call, a webcast replay will be available through the same link on the investors portion of the Intuitive Machines’ website at https://investors.intuitivemachines.com.\n\n**Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this press release, the Company has included certain financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and constitute “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined by the SEC. This includes adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management team uses to assess the Company’s operating performance and is calculated as net income (loss) excluding results from non-operating sources including interest income, interest expense, gain on extinguishing of debt, share-based compensation, change in fair value instruments, gain or loss on issuance of securities, other income/expense, depreciation, impairment of property and equipment, and provision for income taxes. Intuitive Machines has included Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in the Company’s operating results and because it is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical measure, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Other companies, including companies in Intuitive Machines’ industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income (loss) and our other GAAP results. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included below under the heading “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measure.”\n\nWe define free cash flow as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe that free cash flow is a meaningful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from operations that, after purchases of property and equipment, can be used for strategic initiatives, including continuous investment in our business and strengthening our balance sheet. Free Cash Flow has limitations as a liquidity measure, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our cash flows as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Free Cash Flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP; Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences among methods of calculation; and Free Cash Flow may be affected in the near to medium term by the timing of capital investments, fluctuations in our growth and the effect of such fluctuations on working capital and changes in our cash conversion cycle. A reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included below under the heading “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measure.”\n\nThe Company has also included contracted backlog, which is defined as the total estimate of the revenue the Company expects to realize in the future as a result of performing work on awarded contracts, less the amount of revenue the Company has previously recognized. Intuitive Machines monitors its backlog because we believe it is a forward-looking indicator of potential sales which can be helpful to investors in evaluating the performance of its business and identifying trends over time. \n\n**About Intuitive Machines**\n\nIntuitive Machines is a diversified space exploration, infrastructure, and services company focused on fundamentally disrupting lunar access economics. In 2024, Intuitive Machines became the first commercial company to land and operate on the lunar surface, validating its ability to provide the three service pillars required to commercialize a celestial body: delivery, data & communications, and autonomous operations in space. The Company empowers its customers to achieve their ambitious visions and commercial goals in space through seamless collaboration with its robust service pillars.

Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * Free Cash Flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n  * Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences among methods of calculation.\n  * Free Cash Flow may be affected in the near to medium term by the timing of capital investments, fluctuations in our growth and the effect of such fluctuations on working capital and changes in our cash conversion cycle.\n\n\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash used in operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow:\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**(in thousands)**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet cash used in operating activities| (55,622| )| (22,933| )  \nPurchases of property and equipment| (5,185| )| (27,668| )  \nFree cash flow| (60,807| )| (50,601| )  \n  \n**Backlog**\n\nThe following table presents our backlog as of the periods indicated:\n\n**(in thousands)**| **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nBacklog| $| 316,164| $| 268,566  \n  \nBacklog increased by $47.6 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, due to $235.6 million in new awards primarily associated with a new IM-4 CLPS contract awarded in the third quarter of 2024, the Lunar Terrain Vehicle Services design project, a new commercial payload contract on the IM-3 mission, task order modifications to the IM-2 CLPS contract and the IM-3 CLPS contract. These increases are partially offset by continued performance on existing contracts of $173.4 million and decreases related to contract value adjustments of $14.6 million primarily related to various certain fixed price contracts and task order adjustments on the OMES III contract.\n\nThis press release was published by a CLEAR® Verified individual.\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZTQyMjZiYzUtNTViYi00YTgyLWE2YzItNWUzZTdhMjVkMWZmLTEyNjY4NDM=/tiny/Intuitive-Machines-LLC.png)\n\nSearch Investors\n\nSearch this site\n\nSubmit\n"
