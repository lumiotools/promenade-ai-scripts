Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or the Company’s future financial or operating\nperformance and may be identified by words such as “may,” “should,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “predict,” or similar words.\nThese forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions made by the Company as of the date hereof and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other\nfactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.These forward-looking statements\ninclude, among other things, statements regarding: the Company’s prospects, anticipated advantages the Company expects to realize from its acquisition\nstrategies, the Company’s financial performance, targets, goals, and metrics, the Company’s revenue, gross margin and operating margin targets, participation in\nmultiple markets, its engineering and product development resources, the benefits of the Company’s product development business(including its margin and\ncustomer relationship), the Company’s business opportunities and competitive advantages, the Company’s growth potential and strategies for growth, and\nstatements about customer and industry demand.\nInvestors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, including without\nlimitation risks associated with the identification of suitable acquisition candidates and the successful, efficient execution of acquisition transactions and\nintegration of any such acquisition candidates, economic conditions that affect sales of the products of the Company’s customers, adverse changes in general\neconomic and geopolitical conditions, including, without limitation, global supply chain disruptions, labor cost increases and inflation, the ongoing conflict between\nRussia and Ukraine, other similar conflicts and civil unrest in Haiti, which is in proximity to our manufacturing facilities in the Dominican Republic, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations,the ability of the Company to obtain new customers, the ability of the Company to fulfill its\nobligations on long-term contracts and to retain current customers, particularly our customer who accounted for more than 28% ofour revenue for 2023, the\nability of the Company to maintain and grow its current margins, the ability of the Company to achieve its revenue, gross marginand operating margin targets, the\nCompany’s ability to adapt to changing market needs and other factors as well as other risks and uncertainties that are detailedin the documents filed by the\nCompany with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures\nto facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of the Company’s historical operatingresults. The Company’s\nmanagement believes these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and are similar measures reported by publicly\nlisted U.S. competitors, and regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors, and other interested parties in analyzing operating performance and\nprospects. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, whenviewed with GAAP results and\nthe reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trendsaffecting the Company’s\nbusiness. By providing these non-GAAP measures, the Company’s management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the\nCompany’s performance for the periods presented. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and nota substitute for, financial\ninformation prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures of performance\nused by other companies in other industries or within the same industry.\n2\nWho We Are\nKey Stats:\nHeadquarters: Ticker: Established:\nNewburyport, MA UFPT 1963\nUFP Technologies is an innovative\ndesigner and custom manufacturer\nof comprehensive solutions for\nmedical devices, sterile packaging, Annual Revenue: Market Cap: Share Count:\nand other highly engineered ~$535 million2 ~$2.6 Billion1 ~7.7 million1\ncustom products.\n~4,000 20 8 Design\nAssociates/ Manufacturing R&D Centers\nTemps Facilities\n1.

          "content": "UFP Technologies, Inc.\nAudit Committee Charter\nAdopted by the Board of Directors\non March 13, 2024\nI. Purpose\nThe primary purpose of the Audit Committee (the \"Committee\") is to assist the Board of\nDirectors (the \"Board\") of UFP Technologies, Inc. (the \"Company\") with the oversight of: (i) the\nintegrity of the Company’s financial statements, (ii) the Company’s compliance with legal and\nregulatory requirements and (iii) the qualifications, independence, appointment, retention,\ncompensation, and performance of the Company's registered public accounting firm.\nThe term \"registered public accounting firm\" as used herein shall mean any public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \"Accounting Board\")\nunder Section 102 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that performs the independent auditing\nfunction for the Company.\nAlthough the Committee has the powers and responsibilities set forth in this Charter, the role of\nthe Committee is to provide independent review and oversight of the Company’s financial\nreporting process, internal controls, independent auditors, and internal audit function. It is not\nthe duty of the Committee to conduct audits or other accounting procedures, to establish and\nmaintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, or to\ndetermine that the Company's financial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate\nand are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable rules and\nregulations. These are the responsibilities of Company management, and subject to audit by the\nCompany's registered public accounting firm.\nII. Structure, Process and Membership Requirements\nThe Committee shall consist of not less than three members of the Board appointed by\nresolution of the Board and shall serve at the discretion of the Board.

          "content": "UFP Technologies, Inc.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nAdopted March 13, 2024\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of UFP Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted\nthese guidelines as a general framework to assist the Board in carrying out its responsibilities.\nThese guidelines, together with the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and charters of the\ncommittees of the Board, form the framework for governance of the Company. These guidelines\nare not intended as binding legal obligations or inflexible requirements and are not intended to\ninterpret applicable laws and regulations, or to modify the Company’s certificate of incorporation\nor bylaws, or the charters of the committees of the Board.\n2. ROLE OF THE BOARD\nThe Board, on behalf of the Company and its stockholders, oversees and provides general\ndirection to the management of the Company. The Company’s senior officers, under the\ndirection of the Chief Executive Officer, are responsible for the operations of the Company,\nimplementation of the strategic, financial, and management policies of the Company,\npreparation of financial statements and other reports that accurately reflect requisite information\nabout the Company, and timely reports which inform the Board about the foregoing matters.\n3. BOARD COMPOSITION\nA. Size of the Board\nThe Board, with the assistance of its Nominating Committee, periodically reviews the\nappropriate size of the Board and how many directors shall stand for election each year.\nB. Independent Directors\nAt least a majority of the directors serving on the Board will meet the standards of director\nindependence set forth in the applicable Nasdaq listing standards as the same may be\namended from time to time (the “listing standards”), as well as other factors not inconsistent with\nthe listing standards that the Board considers appropriate for effective oversight and decision\nmaking by the Board.\nC. Affirmative Determination of Independence\nThe Board will affirmatively determine annually, and at other times required by the applicable\nlisting standards, that the directors designated as independent by it have no material\nrelationships to the Company (either directly or through an organization in which the director is a\npartner, stockholder or officer or otherwise financially interested) that may interfere with the\nexercise of their independence from management and the Company.\nD. Management Directors\nThe Board may appoint or nominate to serve on the Board members of the Company’s\nmanagement whose experience and role at the Company are expected to help the Board fulfill\nits responsibilities.\nRev. 03.13.24\nE. Selection of Board Members\nThe Company’s shareholders elect a specified number of Board members annually, except for\nBoard action to fill vacancies. The Nominating Committee is responsible for recommending to\nthe Board director candidates for nomination and election and may rely on input provided by a\nnumber of sources, including the Nominating Committee members, the Company’s other\ndirectors or officers, the Company’s shareholders, and third parties such as professional search\nfirms. In making its recommendations to the Board, the Nominating Committee annually reviews\nthe applicable skills and characteristics required of Board nominees in the context of current\nBoard and committee composition, and Company circumstances. A shareholder wishing to\nformally nominate a candidate for election to the Board must do so by following the procedures\nset forth in the Company’s bylaws.\nF. Length of Board Service\nThe Board and the Nominating Committee may review the length of service of the Board’s\nmembers when a director is eligible to be re-nominated for Board membership, including an\nassessment of individual director performance, number of other public and private company\nBoards on which the individual serves, composition of the Board at that time, and other relevant\nfactors. The Board generally believes that directors should not stand for re-election after\nreaching the age of 75.\nG. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nThe Board and Nominating Committee are committed to a diverse, equitable and inclusive\nenvironment where all members feel respected and valued. Expanding the diversity of the\nBoard is considered by the Nominating Committee as it monitors the skillsets required to\nmaintain an effective Board that supports the Company’s vision and strategy.\nH. Chairman and Lead Independent Director\nThe Company separates the role of Chief Executive Officer from the leadership of the Board in\nrecognition of the different roles of each position and to foster independent leadership of the\nBoard. When the individual serving as Chairman of the Board is an executive officer, the\nindependent directors will designate a Lead Independent Director from among the independent\nmembers of the Board to lead the Board. In such position, the Lead Independent Director will\nchair and preside over meetings of the independent members of the Board during their\nexecutive sessions held at each Board meeting.\nI. Board Compensation\nThe Board, through its Compensation Committee, will review or request outside consultants to\nreview, appropriate compensation policies or changes in compensation policies for the directors\nserving on the Board and its committees. This review may consider the Board compensation\npractices of other comparable public companies, contributions of the directors to Board\nfunctions, time commitments expected for Board and committee service, and other appropriate\nfactors.\nRev. 03.13.24\n4. BOARD MEETINGS\nA. Scheduling of Full Board Meetings\nThe Board will generally hold at least four regularly scheduled meetings per year and will hold\nadditional special meetings as necessary. Each director is also encouraged to attend the\nCompany’s annual meeting of shareholders.\nB. Meetings of Independent Directors\nThe independent directors will meet in executive session without members of management\npresent, at such times and for such purposes as the independent directors consider to be\nappropriate. For the convenience of the directors, these meetings may, but need not, be\nscheduled to coincide with the dates of regular Board meetings. The independent directors may\ninvite the Company’s officers, employees, and professional advisers to attend portions of these\nmeetings.\nC. Agenda\nThe Chairman of the Board and/or Lead Independent Director, as applicable, working with\nmanagement, will have primary responsibility for establishing the agenda for each meeting and\narranging for the agenda to be sent in advance of the meeting to the directors. Each committee\nof the Board, and each individual director, is encouraged to suggest items for inclusion on the\nagenda.\nD. Access to Employees and Independent Advisors\nThe Company’s management will afford each director access to the Company’s officers,\nemployees, and professional advisers for any purpose reasonably related to the Board’s\nresponsibilities.\nE. Independent Inquiries and Advisers\nThe Board is authorized to conduct investigations, and to retain, at the expense of the\nCompany, independent legal, accounting, investment banking, or other professional advisers\nselected by the Board, for any matters relating to the purpose or responsibilities of the Board.\n5. COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD\nA. Committees\nThe standing committees of the Board are the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee\nand the Nominating Committee. The Board may from time to time establish additional\ncommittees.\nB. Committee Member Selection\nThe Board will designate the members and the chairperson of each committee. Each member of\nthe Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating Committee will be\nindependent as defined in the listing standards and applicable laws and regulations.\nRev. 03.13.24\nC. Committee Functions\nEach standing committee of the Board will have a written charter approved by the Board in\ncompliance with the listing standards and applicable laws and regulations. The number and\ncontent of committee meetings and means of carrying out committee responsibilities will be\ndetermined by each committee in light of the committee’s charter, if applicable, the authority\ndelegated by the Board to the committee, and legal, regulatory, accounting or governance\nprinciples applicable to that committee’s function. The Company will afford access to the\nCompany’s officers, employees, professional advisers, and other resources, as necessary, to\nenable committee members to carry out their responsibilities.\n6. BOARD MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES\nA. Director Responsibilities\na) Generally. A director is expected to discharge his or her director duties, including duties\nas a member of a committee on which the director serves, in good faith and in a manner\nthe director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company. Each\ndirector should be sufficiently familiar with the business of the Company, including its\nfinancial statements and capital structure, and the risks and competition it faces, to\nfacilitate active and effective participation in the deliberations of the Board and of each\ncommittee on which he or she serves.\nb) Disclose Relationships. Each director is required to promptly update the Nominating\nCommittee of any material change to the director’s employment status or the acceptance\nof a position as an executive officer or director of any public or private company. Each\nindependent director is further expected to disclose promptly to the Board any existing or\nproposed relationships with the Company (other than service as a Board member or on\ncommittees of the Board) that could affect the independence of the director under the\nlisting standards or any additional standards as may be established by the Board of\ndirectors from time to time. An independent director who ceases to qualify as such after\nelection to the Board will be required to tender a resignation as a director promptly to the\nNominating Committee. The Nominating Committee will consider the tendered\nresignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation,\ntaking into consideration the effect of such change on the interests of the Company.\nc) Attendance. Board members are expected to devote sufficient time and attention to\nprepare for, attend and participate in Board meetings and meetings of the committees on\nwhich they serve, including advance review of meeting materials that may be circulated\nprior to each meeting.\nd) Reliance on Information. In discharging responsibilities as a director, a director is entitled\nto rely in good faith on reports or other information provided by Company management,\nthe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and other persons as to\nmatters the director reasonably believes to be within such other person’s professional or\nexpert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of\nthe Company.\ne) Service on Outside Boards. Directors who serve as chief executive officers, named\nexecutive officers or in equivalent positions should generally not serve on more than two\nboards of public companies (including their own board), and other directors should not\nserve on more than four boards of public companies.\nRev. 03.13.24\nB. Review of Governance Guidelines\nThe guidelines memorialized herein have developed over a period of years. The Board expects\nto review these guidelines periodically, generally no more than once a year, as appropriate.\nC. Succession Planning\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing CEO succession planning and approving and\nmaintaining a succession plan for the chief executive officer and other key senior officers.\n7. MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY\nA. FINANCIAL REPORTING AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE.\nThe Board’s governance and oversight functions do not relieve the primary responsibilities of\nthe Company’s management for:\na) preparing financial statements that accurately and fairly present the Company’s financial\nresults and condition, and\nb) maintaining systems, procedures and a corporate culture that promote compliance with\nlegal and regulatory requirements and the ethical conduct of the Company’s business.\nB. CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS\nExecutive management has the primary responsibility to establish policies concerning the\nCompany’s communications with investors, the press, customers, suppliers and employees.\n8. STOCK OWNERSHIP BY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS\nA. Purpose\nThe Board believes that significant stock ownership by Board members and members of senior\nmanagement, designated by the Nominating Committee from time to time, further aligns their\ninterests with the interests of the Company's stockholders.\nB. Ownership Goal\nAccordingly, the Board has established a goal that (i) within five years after joining the Board or\nfive years from the date of adoption of these guidelines, whichever is later, each non-employee\nBoard member beneficially own Company stock valued at three times his or her annual base\ncash retainer fee, (ii) within five years after being appointed to his or her position or five years\nfrom the date of adoption of these guidelines, whichever is later, the Chief Executive Officer\nbeneficially own Company stock valued at three times his or her base salary and (iii) within five\nyears after being appointed to his or her position or five years from the date of adoption of these\nguidelines, whichever is later, the other named executive officers (as set forth in the Company’s\nannual proxy statement) beneficially own Company stock valued at one times his or her base\nsalary .\nRev. 03.13.24\nC. Measurement\nFor purposes of meeting this ownership goal, unvested stock unit awards, restricted stock and\nrestricted stock units, and unvested and unexercised stock options having an option exercise\nprice below the market price of the underlying Company stock, will be counted. Such stock\noptions will be valued at their intrinsic value (the market price of the underlying stock less the\nexercise price).\nRev. 03.13.24"

          "content": "UFP Technologies, Inc.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nAdopted by the Board of Directors\nMarch 13, 2024\nIntroduction\nUFP Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) is committed to conducting its business activities as a\ngood corporate citizen with honesty and integrity and in compliance with all laws, rules and\nregulations applicable to it. This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) covers a\nwide range of business practices and procedures and sets out basic principles to guide all\ndirectors, officers and employees of the Company.\nThe Code should be read in conjunction with the other policies and procedures that the\nCompany has established from time to time, including, but not limited to, its Code of Ethics for\nChief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers (attached to this Code) and its Complaint\nProcedures for Accounting and Auditing Matters. All of our employees, officers and directors\nmust conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper\nbehavior. The Code should also be provided to and followed by the Company’s agents and\nrepresentatives, including consultants.\nIf a law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must comply with the law. If you have any\nquestions about these conflicts, you should ask your supervisor how to handle the situation.\nThose who violate the standards in this Code will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination of employment. If you are in a situation which you believe may violate or\nlead to a violation of this Code, follow the guidelines described in Section 18 of this Code.\n1. Compliance with Laws, Rules, and Regulations\nThe Code cannot and is not intended to cover every applicable law, rule or regulation, or\nprovide answers to all questions that may arise. Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is\nthe foundation on which this Company’s ethical standards are built. All employees, officers and\ndirectors must respect and obey the laws of the cities, states, and countries in which we\noperate. Although not all employees, officers and directors are expected to know the details of\nall applicable laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough to determine when to\nseek advice from supervisors, managers, or other appropriate personnel.\nIf requested, from time to time the Company will hold information and training sessions to\npromote compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, including insider-trading laws.\n2. Conflicts of Interest\nA “conflict of interest” may exist when a person’s private interest (or the interest of a member of\nhis or her family) interferes, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company. A\nconflict of interest can arise when an employee, officer or director (or a member of his or her\nfamily) takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her Company\nwork objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee, officer\nor director, or members of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of\nhis or her position in the Company. It is a conflict of interest for a Company employee to work\nRev. 03.13.24\nsimultaneously for a competitor, customer, or supplier. You are not allowed to work for a\ncompetitor as a consultant or board member. The best policy is to avoid any direct or indirect\nbusiness connections with our customers, suppliers, or competitors, except on our behalf.\nConflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, except under guidelines\napproved by the Board of Directors. Conflicts of interest may not always be clear-cut, so if you\nhave a question, you should consult with either a Vice President or the Company’s President\nand CEO. Any employee, officer or director who becomes aware of a conflict, or potential\nconflict, should bring it to the attention of an executive of the Corporation or consult the\nprocedures described in Section 18 of this Code of Conduct and Ethics.\n3. Insider Trading\nEmployees, officers and directors who have access to non-public information about the\nCompany and its subsidiaries are not permitted to use or disclose that information for stock\ntrading purposes or for any other purpose except the conduct of our business. All non- public\ninformation about the Company should be considered confidential information. To use non-\npublic information for personal financial benefit or to “tip” others who might make an investment\ndecision based on this information is not only unethical but also illegal. In order to assist with\ncompliance with laws against insider trading, the Company has adopted a Policy Statement on\nSecurities Trades by Company Officers, Directors and Other Employees. This policy has been\ndistributed to every employee. If you have any questions, please contact the Compliance\nOfficers identified in the policy.\n4. Corporate Opportunities\nAll directors, officers and employees owe a duty to the Company to advance its interests when\nthe opportunity arises. Employees, officers and directors are prohibited from taking for\nthemselves personally (or for the benefit of friends or family members), opportunities that are\ndiscovered through the use of Company assets, property, information or position without the\nconsent of the Board of Directors. Directors, officers and employees may not use Company\nassets, property, information, or position for personal gain (including gain of friends or family\nmembers), and no employee may compete with the Company directly or indirectly.\n5. Competition and Fair Dealing\nWe seek to outperform our competition fairly and honestly. Stealing proprietary information,\npossessing trade secret information that was obtained without the owner’s consent, or inducing\nsuch disclosures by past or present employees of other companies is prohibited. Each director,\nofficer and employee should endeavor to respect the rights of and deal fairly with the\nCompany’s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No director, officer and employee\nshould take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged\ninformation, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other intentional unfair-dealing\npractice(s).\nThe purpose of business entertainment and gifts in a commercial setting is to create good will\nand sound working relationships, not to gain unfair advantage with customers. No gift or\nentertainment should ever be offered, given, provided, or accepted by any Company director,\nofficer and employee, family member of a director, officer and employee or agent unless it: (1) is\nRev. 03.13.24\nnot a cash gift, (2) is consistent with customary business practices, (3) is not excessive in value,\n(4) cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff, and (5) does not violate any laws or regulations.\nPlease discuss with your supervisor any gifts or proposed gifts which you are not certain are\nappropriate.\n6. Discrimination and Harassment\nThe diversity of the Company’s employees is a tremendous asset. We are firmly committed to\nproviding equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate any discrimination\nor harassment of any kind. Examples include derogatory comments based on racial or ethnic\ncharacteristics and unwelcome sexual advances.\n7. Health and Safety\nThe Company strives to provide each employee with a safe and healthy work environment.\nEach employee has a responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all\nemployees by following safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents, injuries\nand unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.\nViolence and threatening behavior are not permitted. Employees should report to work in\ncondition to perform their duties, free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. The use of\nillegal drugs or alcohol in the workplace will not be tolerated.\nViolations by any employees or contractors of any safety protocol may result in disciplinary\naction, up to and including termination of employment or service.\n8. Record-Keeping\nThe Company requires honest and accurate recording and reporting of information in order to\nmake responsible business decisions. For example, only the true and actual number of hours\nworked will be reported.\nMany employees regularly use business expense accounts, which must be documented and\nrecorded accurately. If you are not sure whether a certain expense is legitimate, ask your\nsupervisor or your controller.\nAll of the Company’s books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in\nreasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company’s transactions, and must conform\nboth to applicable legal requirements and to the Company’s system of internal controls.\nUnrecorded or “off the books” funds or assets shall not be maintained unless permitted by\napplicable law or regulation.\nBusiness records and communications often become public, and we should avoid exaggeration,\nderogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and companies\nthat can be misunderstood. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos, and formal reports.\nRecords should always be retained or destroyed according to the Company’s record retention\npolicies. In accordance with those policies, in the event of litigation or governmental\ninvestigation please consult the Chief Financial Officer.\nRev. 03.13.24\n9. Confidentiality\nDirectors, officers and employees must maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to\nthem by the Company or its customers, suppliers or partners, except when disclosure is\nexpressly authorized or is required or permitted by applicable law. Confidential information\nincludes all non-public information that might be of use to the Company’s competitors, or\nharmful to the Company or its customers, if disclosed. It also includes information that suppliers\nand customers have entrusted to us. Confidential information should not be used for personal\nadvantage. The obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employment\nends. In connection with this obligation, every employee shall have executed a confidentiality\nagreement when he or she began his or her employment with the Company or at any future\ntime at the discretion of the Company.\n10. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll directors, officers and employees will endeavor to protect the Company’s assets and ensure\ntheir efficient use. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Company’s\nprofitability. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for\ninvestigation. Company equipment should not be used for non-Company business.\nThe obligation to protect the Company’s assets includes its proprietary information. Proprietary\ninformation includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and\ncopyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans, engineering and manufacturing\nideas, designs, databases, records, salary information and any non-public financial data and\nreports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information is prohibited and it could also be\nillegal and result in civil or criminal penalties.\nAll Company-provided equipment, software and communication systems, including without\nlimitation voice mail, e-mail, Internet, file folders and personal computer systems, are the\nproperty of the Company and as such are provided to employees for business purposes only.\nThe review, transmission, retrieval or storage of offensive, obscene or other inappropriate\nmaterial via the Company’s computing and communication systems, including via the Internet\nand electronic mail, is strictly prohibited. The use of the Company’s e-mail system to send\noffensive or inappropriate statements, make solicitations or divulge confidential information is\nalso prohibited.\nAll communications made via Company property are considered records and property of the\nCompany. The Company reserves the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to monitor,\naccess, copy, modify, disclose or delete the contents of messages sent or received over its\nsystems, including Internet points of contact.\n11. Ethical Dealings at Home and Abroad\nThe Company expects employee conduct to meet the Company’s high ethical standards. These\nstandards are reflected in how the Company interacts with government officials in the United\nStates, as well as overseas. These standards also apply to how the Company conducts\ninternational business, as well as what the Company sells and to whom.\nPayments or gifts to government officials, whether in the United States or abroad are especially\nsensitive areas. The Company and all directors, officers and employees must avoid even the\nappearance of impropriety when working with officials (including government employees)\nRev. 03.13.24\nregardless of whether they work for U.S. federal, state, municipal, or other public authorities or\nforeign governments. Remember, a director, officer and employee may not do indirectly\nanything that is prohibited to be done directly. This means that a director, officer and employee\nmay not allow a third party to make an illegal offer, promise or payment on behalf of such\ndirector, officer, or employee or the Company.\nFailure to meet these standards may result in violation of U.S. or foreign law. Violations can\nresult in criminal or civil penalties for individuals and the Company.\nViolations can impact U.S. foreign policy and national security. In addition, these problems can\nresult in the loss of business, as well as damaging publicity for the Company and its employees.\nGenerally speaking, U.S. laws from federal to local governments prohibit government\nemployees from accepting gifts or entertainment in any form from any contractor or vendor\ndoing (or seeking to do) business with the government. U.S. law generally prohibits anyone from\noffering anything of value, even promising something of value, to government officials to obtain\nor retain business or influence their discretion.\nThe same standards apply to the Company’s dealings with non-U.S. government officials. The\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is one of several laws that prohibit improper payments or\noffers to foreign government officials, either directly or through a third party. No payment or offer\nmay be made to obtain, retain or direct business or to gain any improper advantage.\nThese same standards apply to “what the Company sells and to whom.” The United States has\nexport control laws designed to make sure that parties that would do harm to the United States\ndo not acquire our sensitive technologies or otherwise do business with the Company.\n12. Political Contributions\nBusiness contributions to political campaigns are strictly regulated by federal, state, and local\nlaw in the U.S. and many other jurisdictions. Directors, officers and employees may not, without\nthe approval of the Chief Executive Officer, make political contributions of any kind to any\npolitical candidate or holder of any national, state or local government office on behalf of the\nCompany. Directors, officers and employees may make personal contributions, but should not\nrepresent that they are making contributions on the Company’s behalf. Specific questions\nshould be directed to the General Counsel.\n13. Where to Find More Information\nThe Code is a summarized version of many policies and laws and does not cover all situations.\nAny questions of applicability or interpretation should be addressed to your supervisors,\nmanagers or other appropriate personnel. Directors, officers and employees should also refer to\nother policies of the Company in effect from time to time.\n14. How to Report Illegal or Unethical Behavior\nEmployees are encouraged to talk to supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel\nabout observed illegal or unethical behavior and when in doubt, about the best course of action\nin a particular situation. It is the policy of the Company not to allow retaliation for reports of\nmisconduct by others made in good faith by employees. Employees are expected to cooperate\nin internal investigations of misconduct. Employees must read the Company’s Complaint\nProcedures for Accounting and Auditing Matters, which describes the Company’s procedures\nRev. 03.13.24\nfor the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding\naccounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters. Any employee may submit a good\nfaith concern regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters without fear of dismissal or\nretaliation of any kind.\n15. Responding to Improper Conduct\nIf any director, officer or employee violates this Code, he or she will be subject to disciplinary\naction. Supervisors and managers of a disciplined employee may also be subject to disciplinary\naction for their failure to properly oversee an employee’s conduct or for retaliation against an\nemployee who reports a violation. The Company’s response to misconduct will depend upon a\nnumber of factors, including whether the improper behavior involved illegal conduct. Disciplinary\naction may include, but is not limited to, reprimands, warnings, probation, suspension,\ndemotion, reassignment, reduction in salary or immediate termination. Employees should be\naware that certain actions and omissions prohibited by the Code might be crimes that could lead\nto individual criminal prosecution and, upon conviction, to fines and imprisonment.\n16. Condition of Employment or Service\nCompliance with this Code shall be a condition of employment and of continued employment\nwith the Company, and conduct not in accordance with this Code shall constitute grounds for\ndisciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. This Code does not in any\nway constitute an employment contract or an assurance of continued employment. Employees\nare employees at will. This Code is for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Company and may\nnot be used or relied upon by any other party. The Company may modify or repeal the\nprovisions of this Code or adopt a new Code at any time it deems appropriate, with or without\nnotice.\n17. Waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\nAny waiver of this Code for executive officers or directors may be made only by the Board or, if\npermitted by applicable rules, a Board committee, and will be promptly disclosed as required by\nlaw or stock exchange or stock market rules.\n18. Compliance Procedures\nWe must all work to ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of this Code.\nHowever, in some situations it is difficult to know if a violation has occurred. Since we cannot\nanticipate every situation that will arise, it is important that we have a way to approach a new\nquestion or problem. These are the steps to keep in mind:\n• Make sure you have all the facts. To reach the right solutions, we must be as fully\ninformed as possible.\n• Ask yourself: What specifically am I being asked to do? Does it seem unethical or\nimproper? This will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced with, and\nthe alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense; if something seems\nunethical or improper, it probably is.\n• Clarify your responsibility and role. In most situations, there is shared responsibility. Are\nyour colleagues informed? It may help to get others involved and discuss the problem.\nRev. 03.13.24\n• Discuss the problem with your supervisor. This is the basic guidance for all situations. In\nmany cases, your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the question, and will\nappreciate being brought into the decision-making process. Remember that it is your\nsupervisor’s responsibility to help solve problems.\n• Seek help from Company resources. In the rare case where it may not be appropriate to\ndiscuss an issue with your supervisor or where you do not feel comfortable approaching\nyour supervisor with your question, discuss it locally with your plant manager or the\nCompany’s corporate Human Resources manager.\n• You may report ethical violations in confidence and without fear of retaliation. If your\nsituation requires that your identity be kept secret, your anonymity will be protected. The\nCompany does not permit retaliation of any kind against employees for good faith reports\nof ethical violations.\n• Always ask first, act later. If you are unsure of what to do in any situation, seek guidance\nbefore you act.\nRev. 03.13.24\nCode of Ethics for Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers\nUFP Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable\nto all directors and employees of the Company.

          "content": "California Transparency in Supply Chains Act\nThe California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) became effective on\nJanuary 1, 2012. This law seeks to increase the availability of information from certain\nmanufacturers and retailers operating in the state of California regarding their efforts, if any, to\naddress the issues of slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply chains. Any company\ndoing business in the state of California with worldwide gross receipts of $100 million is required\nto provide a conspicuous, easily understood link on their websites to the information describing\nthe company’s efforts.\nUFP Technologies, Inc. (“UFP”) supports the California Supply Chain Act’s objective to provide\nconsumers with critical information about the efforts that companies are undertaking to prevent\nand root out human trafficking and slavery in their product supply chains – whether here or\noverseas. UFP requires its suppliers to be compliant with respect to all laws and regulations\napplicable to them and is diligent in its own efforts to comply with all regulations applicable to its\nbusiness. UFP does not produce or sell any of the high-risk products that are stipulated on the\nUS Department of Labor listing of “Goods produced by child labor or forced labor” but remains\ndiligent in its review of high risk products and countries.\n1. Verification\nWe do not utilize a third party to evaluate risk or verify that our suppliers do not engage in\nslave labor or human trafficking practices. We use various types of available information\nfrom external sources to help us assess the potential risk of slavery or human trafficking\nin our supply chain. UFP does not tolerate child labor, forced slave labor or human\ntrafficking practices and will not work with suppliers who do not comply with laws and\nregulations in this regard.\n2. Audit\nUFP does not conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate their compliance with company\nstandards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains.\n3. Certification\nUFP holds our suppliers to a high ethical standard and thus requires their compliance\nwith applicable laws and regulations at all times. These expectations are described in our\nStandard Terms and Conditions of Purchase which is applicable to all suppliers who do\nbusiness with us and is available on our website, www.ufpt.com.\nUFP evaluates its relationship with its suppliers on an ongoing basis and reserves the\nright to terminate its relationship with a supplier who fails to comply with any applicable\nlaws and regulations which would include laws prohibiting forced labor and human\ntrafficking.\n4. Internal accountability standards and procedures.\nUFP holds our directors, executives, and employees, to a high ethical standard and thus\nrequires their compliance with applicable laws and regulations at all times. These\nexpectations are described in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which is\navailable on our website, www.ufpt.com. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\nexplicitly refers to compliance with laws, rules, and regulations and requires all\nRev. 06.07.24\nemployees to respect and obey the laws of the cities, states, countries and towns in\nwhich we operate. Employees are encouraged to speak with managers or utilize the\nhotline provided for anonymous reporting of suspected violations of company policy and\nthe Company takes any alleged violations of policy very seriously. We respond promptly\nand conduct investigations when appropriate.

Training\nUFP provides information on forced labor and human trafficking practices and the laws\nthat prevent such practices to managers with direct supply chain responsibility. These\nemployees are taught to be mindful of these practices and the potential risks in certain\nareas of the world to enable them to mitigate risks when making decisions in their\nresponsibilities for direct supply chain interactions.\nRev. 06.07.24"

          "content": "UFP TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nPOLICY STATEMENT ON SECURITIES TRADES\nBY COMPANY OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES\nAdopted by the Board of Directors on March 13, 2024\nIntroduction\nIn the normal course of business, employees, officers and directors of UFP Technologies,\nInc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), may use or have access to confidential and material\ninformation that is not generally available to the investing public. You, as an employee, officer or\ndirector of the Company, have an important ethical and legal obligation not to engage in trading\nin securities while in possession of material non-public information (“insider trading”) and to\nmaintain the confidentiality of such non-public information. Insider trading is a crime; you and\nthe Company may be subject to severe civil and criminal penalties as a result of trading in securities\nwhile in possession of material non-public information or as a result of unauthorized disclosure of\nmaterial non-public information.\nThe Company has adopted this Policy to prevent violations of the U.S. securities laws by the\nCompany’s officers, directors and employees and to avoid even the appearance of improper\nconduct by these persons. R. Jeffrey Bailly, Ronald J. Lataille and Christopher Litterio have been\ndesignated by the Company as the Compliance Officers for administering this Policy, and any\nquestions regarding interpretation of the Policy should be addressed to one of them. The Company\nmay from time to time designate other persons as Compliance Officers for administering this\nPolicy.\nSections 1 through 13 of this Policy apply to every director, officer, and employee and\neach such individual should carefully read those sections in their entirety. Directors, officers\nand certain significant employees of the Company (designated below as Covered Persons) are\nmore likely to possess material non-public information about the Company, and are therefore\nsubject to special requirements concerning transactions in the Company’s securities. Covered\nPersons should pay particular attention to Section 14, regarding pre-clearance of any\ntransactions conducted in Company securities.\nPolicy\n1. Prohibitions.\n(a) No Trading on Inside Information. You may not trade in the securities of the\nCompany, directly or through family members or other persons or entities, while you are in\npossession of material non-public information relating to the Company (except pursuant to a pre-\ncleared trading plan that complies with Rule 10b5-1, as described in Section 5 below). For\nguidance on what constitutes “material non-public information” see Section 3 below. Similarly,\nyou may not trade in the securities of any other company if you are in possession of material non-\npublic information about that company that you obtained in the course of your employment with\nthe Company.\nRev. 03.13.24\n(b) No Tipping. You may not pass material non-public information on to others or\nrecommend to anyone the purchase or sale of any securities when you are aware of such\ninformation. This practice, known as “tipping,” also violates the securities laws and can result in\nthe same civil and criminal penalties that apply to insider trading, even though you did not trade\nand did not gain any benefit from another’s trading.\n(c) Disclosure of Information to Others. The Company is required under Regulation FD\nof the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to avoid the selective disclosure of material\nnonpublic information. The Company has established procedures for releasing material\ninformation in a manner that is designed to achieve broad public dissemination of the information\nimmediately upon its release. You may not, therefore, disclose information to anyone outside the\nCompany, including family members and friends, other than in accordance with those procedures.\nYou also may not discuss the Company or its business in an internet “chat room” or similar\ninternet-based forum.\n(d) General. You may not assist anyone who is engaged in any of the above activities.\nIn addition to applying to the Company’s securities, these prohibitions apply to information about\nand securities of other companies with which the Company has a relationship and as a result of\nwhich you may acquire material non-public information, e.g., customers, suppliers, licensees,\nlicensors, joint venturers or companies with which the Company is considering entering into or\nterminating a material business relationship or other material transaction.\nThese prohibitions also apply to your family members, including your spouse, any family\nmembers or other persons that live in your home, and any family members who do not live in your\nhome but whose transactions in Company securities are directed by you or subject to your\ninfluence or control. You will be held responsible for ensuring that securities transactions by any\nof these people comply with this Policy.\n2. Penalties. If you engage in any of the above activities, you may subject yourself, the\nCompany, its officers and directors and other supervisory personnel to civil and criminal liability\nunder United States securities law. Employees who violate this Policy may be subject to\ndisciplinary action by the Company, including termination for cause.\n(a) Civil and Criminal Penalties. Potential penalties for insider trading or tipping violations\ninclude, but are not limited to (1) imprisonment for up to 20 years, (2) criminal fines of up to\n$5,000,000, and (3) civil fines of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided.\n(b) Controlling Person Liability. If the Company fails to take appropriate steps to prevent\nillegal insider trading, the Company may have “controlling person” liability for a trading violation,\nwith civil penalties of up to the greater of $1,000,000 or three times the profit gained or loss\navoided, as well as a criminal penalty of up to $25,000,000. The civil penalties can extend personal\nliability to the Company’s directors, officers and other supervisory personnel if they fail to take\nappropriate steps to prevent insider trading.\n-2-\n(c) Company Sanctions. Failure to comply with this Policy may also subject you to\nCompany-imposed sanctions, up to and including termination for cause, whether or not your\nfailure to comply with this Policy results in a violation of law.\n3. Key Concepts.\n(a) Material Information. Information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a\nreasonable investor would consider the information important in deciding whether to buy, sell or\nhold a security. If disclosure of the information is likely to affect the market price of a security,\nthe information is probably material. A few examples of the type of information that would usually\nbe considered material are:\n• projections of future earnings or losses or other earnings guidance;\n• earnings that are inconsistent with the consensus expectations of the investment\ncommunity;\n• increases or decreases in dividend payments, stock splits, securities offerings or other\nmajor events regarding the Company’s securities;\n• possible mergers and acquisitions;\n• the initiation or termination of significant contracts;\n• changes in management;\n• breakthroughs in technology;\n• the introduction of important product lines;\n• the gain or loss of major customers, suppliers or orders;\n• major marketing changes;\n• developments in actual or threatened litigation; or\n• unusual gains or losses in major operations and financial liquidity problems.\nIt is important to keep in mind that material information need not be something that has\nhappened or definitely will happen; information that something is likely to happen, or even just\nthat it may happen, may be considered material. Material information may be positive or negative.\nMateriality determinations are often challenged with the benefit of hindsight and therefore\nany question about whether particular information is material should be resolved in favor of not\ntrading. If you have any question as to whether particular information is material, you should not\ntrade or communicate the information to anyone without prior approval by a Compliance Officer.\n(b) Non-public Information. “Non-public” information is any information that has not\nbeen disclosed generally to the investing public. One must be able to point to some fact or event\nto show that the information is generally public, such as inclusion in the Company’s reports filed\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or the issuance of a press release or reference\nto the information in publications of general circulation in the United States securities market, such\nas The Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Even after the Company has released\ninformation to the press and the information has been reported, at least two full business days must\nbe allowed for the investing public to absorb and evaluate the information before you may trade\nin the Company’s securities. This means you may not trade until the third business day after the\ninformation is announced to the public. For example, if the Company announced its financial\n-3-\nearnings before trading began on a Tuesday, the first time you could buy or sell Company securities\nwould be the opening of the market on Thursday (assuming you were not then aware of other\nmaterial non-public information). However, if the Company announced its earnings after the start\nof trading on a Tuesday, the earliest you could buy or sell the Company’s securities would be the\nstart of trading on Friday.\n(c) Tipping Information to Others. You may not disclose any material non-public\ninformation to others, including your family members, friends or social acquaintances. This\nprohibition applies whether or not you receive any benefit from the other person’s use of that\ninformation.\n4. Restrictions on Short-Term or Speculative Trading. The Company has determined\nthat there is a substantial likelihood of the appearance of improper conduct by Company personnel\nwhen they engage in certain types of short-term or speculative trading. Therefore, Company\npersonnel are prohibited from engaging in any of the following activities with respect to Company\nsecurities:\n(a) hedging or other similar arrangements with respect to the Company’s securities,\nincluding, without limitation: (i) short sales (Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act also\nprohibits officers and directors of the Company from engaging in short sales of\nCompany stock); or (ii) buying or selling puts or calls, except for those options that\nmight be offered to you by the Company; and\n(b) holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as\ncollateral for a loan\n5. Exceptions\n(a) Approved 10b5-1 Plans.\nTrades by officers, directors and other employees covered by this Policy that are executed\npursuant to a pre-cleared 10b5-1 plan are not subject to the prohibition on trading on the basis of\nmaterial non-public information contained in Section 1(a) of this Policy or, if applicable, to the\nrestrictions set forth in the Company’s pre-clearance procedures and blackout periods.\nRule 10b5-1 provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability under the U.S.\nfederal securities laws for trading plans that meet certain requirements. A 10b5-1 plan must be\nentered into at a time when you are not aware of material non-public information. All plans must\nbe entered into in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of the\nsecurities laws. Once the plan is adopted, you must not exercise any influence over the amount of\nsecurities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of the trade.\nThe Company requires that each 10b5-1 plan (or the form of the 10b5-1 trading plan,\nprovided such form has sufficient details to determine compliance with this Policy) be pre-cleared\nin writing in advance by a Compliance Officer, in accordance with Section 14 hereof. 10b5-1\n-4-\nplans generally may not be adopted during a blackout period. Notwithstanding anything herein to\nthe contrary, it is the individual’s responsibility to comply with this Policy, the requirements of\nRule 10b5-1 and Rule 144, and the requirements of Section 16, regardless of whether a Compliance\nOfficer pre-clears a 10b5-1 plan.\nThe Company reserves the right to bar any transactions in Company securities, even those\npursuant to arrangements previously pre-cleared, if a Compliance Officer or the Board of\nDirectors, in consultation with the Company’s outside securities law counsel, determines that such\na bar is in the best interests of the Company.\n(b) Company Plans.\nThis Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option, to the exercise of\nany right to acquire the Company’s securities pursuant to any equity incentive plan or similar plan,\nor to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company\nwithhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The Policy does\napply, however, to any sale of the underlying stock or to a cashless exercise of an option through\na broker, or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise\nprice of an option. This Policy also applies to the exercise of any stock appreciation right that\nsettles in cash.\n6. No Other Exceptions. Other than as set forth in Sections 5 and 14 herein, there are\nno exceptions to the prohibitions and restrictions set forth in this Policy. Transactions in the\nCompany’s securities that are otherwise necessary for personal reasons, such as personal financial\ncommitments or emergencies, do not excuse you from compliance with this Policy and are\nprohibited if you possess material non-public information.\nIt is important to note that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission takes the\nview that the mere fact that you are aware of material non-public information is enough to\nbar you from trading; it is no excuse that your reasons for trading were not based on that\ninformation.\n7. Inadvertent Disclosure. If material non-public information is inadvertently disclosed\nby any employee, officer or director, you should immediately report the facts to a Compliance\nOfficer so that the Company may take appropriate remedial action.\n8. Post-Termination Transactions. This Policy continues to apply to your transactions\nin Company securities even after you have terminated your employment or other connections to\nthe Company and its affiliates. If you are in possession of material non-public information when\nyour employment terminates, you may not trade in Company securities until that information has\nbecome public or is no longer material.\n9. Company Assistance. If you have any question about specific information or\nproposed transactions, or as to the applicability or interpretation of this Policy or the propriety of\nany desired action, you are encouraged to contact a Compliance Officer.\n-5-\n10. Confidentiality Guidelines. To provide more effective protection against the\ndisclosure of material non-public information, the Company has adopted guidelines (attached to\nthis Policy) with which you should familiarize yourself. These guidelines are not intended to be\nexhaustive. Additional measures to secure the confidentiality of information should be undertaken\nas deemed appropriate under the circumstances. If you have any doubt as to your responsibilities\nunder these guidelines, please seek clarification and guidance from a Compliance Officer before\nyou act. Do not try to resolve any uncertainties on your own.\n11. Personal Responsibility. The ultimate responsibility for adhering to this Policy and\navoiding improper trading lies with you. If you violate this Policy, you may be subject to\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination for cause.\n12. Certification. All employees will be required to certify their understanding of and\nintent to comply with this Policy by means of the Certification attached to this Policy. Directors,\nofficers, and significant employees may be required to certify on an annual basis that they have\ncomplied with this Policy.\n13. No New Legal Liabilities; Compliance with Securities Laws. The Policy and this\nStatement of the Policy do not impose on the Company’s employees, officers or directors or on\nthe Company itself any new legal liabilities to which they would not otherwise be subjected.\nConversely, the restrictions contained in this Policy are in addition to other restrictions on trading\nimposed by the U.S. securities laws that may apply to you, such as the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations\npromulgated under each, including, for example and without limitation, Section 16 and Rule 144.\n14. Pre-clearance of all Transactions by Covered Persons.\n(a) General. This Section 14 shall apply only to executive officers, directors, those\nemployees who have been designated by the Company as significant employees, and each of their\nfamily members and members of their households (collectively, the “Covered Persons”). All\nCovered Persons must obtain the prior approval of a Compliance Officer for any\ntransactions they conduct in the Company’s securities. The Compliance Officers, and each\nof their family members and members of their households, must obtain the prior approval\nof the Company’s outside securities law counsel for any transactions they conduct in the\nCompany’s securities.\n(b) Procedure. A request for pre-clearance should be submitted to a Compliance Officer\nof the Company or the Company’s outside securities law counsel, as applicable, at least two days\nin advance of the proposed transaction. The Compliance Officers of the Company and the\nCompany’s outside securities law counsel, as applicable, are under no obligation to approve a trade\nsubmitted for pre-clearance, and may determine not to permit the trade. The responsibility for pre-\nclearing transactions may be delegated to anyone permitted by the Board of Directors of the\nCompany. Regardless of who is selected to serve as a pre-clearer, a pre-clearer must always be\nkept fully informed of material developments. A Compliance Officer or any applicable pre-clearer\nshall, in all cases, only grant prior approval of a proposed transaction by a Covered Person after\n-6-\nconsulting [with outside securities law counsel to the Company]. Approvals are valid only for 48\nhours from the time provided.\nAny person subject to the pre-clearance requirements who wishes to implement a trading\nplan under Rule 10b5-1 must first pre-clear the plan with a Compliance Officer of the Company.\nCompliance Officers shall consult [with outside securities law counsel to the Company] before\ngranting approval of any trading plan. Transactions effected pursuant to a pre-cleared trading plan\nwill not require further pre-clearance at the time of the transaction if the plan complies with Rule\n10b5-1 and specifies the dates, prices and amounts of the contemplated trades, or establishes a\nformula for determining the dates, prices and amounts.\n(c) Quarterly Blackout Periods. The Company’s announcement of its quarterly financial\nresults almost always has the potential to have a material effect on the market for the Company’s\nsecurities. Therefore, Covered Persons may not trade in the Company’s securities during the\nperiod beginning two weeks prior to the end of the Company’s fiscal quarter or year end and ending\nafter the second full business day following the Company’s issuance of its quarterly or annual\nearnings release.\nThe Company may on occasion issue interim earnings guidance or other potentially material\ninformation by means of a press release, an SEC filing on Form 8-K or other means designed to\nachieve widespread dissemination of the information. You should anticipate that trades are\nunlikely to be pre-cleared while the Company is in the process of assembling the information to\nbe released and until the information has been released and fully absorbed by the market.\n(d) Event-Specific Blackout Periods. From time to time, an event may occur that is\nmaterial to the Company and is known by only a few Covered Persons. So long as the event\nremains material and non-public, Covered Persons as are designated by a Compliance Officer of\nthe Company may not trade in the Company’s securities. The existence of an event-specific\nblackout will not be announced except to those who are aware of the event giving rise to the\nblackout. If, however, a person whose trades are subject to pre-clearance requests permission to\ntrade in the Company’s securities at a time when an event-specific blackout is in effect, a\nCompliance Officer of the Company will inform the requester of the existence of a blackout period\nwithout necessarily disclosing the reason for the blackout. Any person made aware of the existence\nof an event-specific blackout should not disclose the existence of the blackout to any other person.\nThe failure of a Compliance Officer of the Company to designate a person as being subject to an\nevent-specific blackout will not relieve that person of the obligation not to trade while aware of\nmaterial nonpublic information.\n(e) Hardship Exceptions. A person who is subject to a quarterly earnings blackout\nperiod and who has an unexpected and urgent need to sell Company securities in order to generate\ncash may, in appropriate circumstances, be permitted to sell even during the blackout period.\nHardship exceptions may be granted only by a Compliance Officer of the Company, upon the\nadvice of outside securities law counsel to the Company, and must be requested at least two days\nin advance of the proposed trade. A hardship exception may be granted only if a Compliance\nOfficer of the Company concludes that the Company’s earnings information for the applicable\nquarter does not constitute material nonpublic information. Under no circumstance will a hardship\nexception be granted during an event-specific blackout period.\n-7-\nThis Policy Statement on Securities Trades by Company Officers, Directors and Other Employees\nsupersedes any previous policy of the Company concerning insider trading.\n-8-\nCERTIFICATION\nI have read and understand the Company’s Policy Statement on Securities Trades by\nCompany Officers, Directors and Other Employees (the “Policy”). I understand that the\nCompany’s Compliance Officers are available to answer any questions I have regarding the Policy.\nI agree to comply with the Policy in all respects during my employment or other relationship with\nthe Company.
