Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and represent Great Elm’s assumptions and expectations in light of currently available information. These statements involve risks, variables and uncertainties, and Great Elm’s actual performance results may differ from those projected, and any such differences may be material. For information on certain factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from Great Elm’s expectations, please see Great Elm’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Additional information relating to Great Elm’s financial position and results of operations is also contained in Great Elm’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and available for download at its website [www.greatelmgroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GmzTm6_inMraoAdsn5L6IEyojMrxPTy_20Azxd4Spfrvwmq2tLM-pWrpsr4l7jgSbPOeU5HWYBqfFOgIdAxuGOWjJyGgaV7LLcxfifvl4gM=) or at the SEC website [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PGJ_-EWDaEag5jspSZE2ImHsd8jsTup1d2zG-_iqMuYamk4g5Mz2YnWDlgQj1xa_NmREI2rQsFmMcGI87pKRWQ==).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC, and in public disclosures, of financial measures that are not in accordance with US GAAP, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA is derived from methodologies other than in accordance with US GAAP. Great Elm believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for investors to use in evaluating Great Elm’s businesses. In addition, Great Elm’s management reviews Adjusted EBITDA as they evaluate acquisition opportunities.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it either in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analyzing Great Elm’s results as reported under US GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by Great Elm may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\n\nIncluded in the financial tables below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure, net income from continuing operations.\n\n**Endnotes** 1 Pro forma FPAUM incorporates net proceeds from $5.4 million of GECC 8.125% Notes due 2029 issued in October as well as the redemption in October of $45.3 million of GECC 6.75% Notes due January 2025. 2 Cash and marketable securities include approximately $40 thousand of restricted cash. 3 Assumes invested at inception on November 1, 2023, and remained invested throughout the succeeding eleven months, net of fees and expenses. Performance results should not be regarded as final until audited financial statements are issued covering the period shown. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Finally, we launched complementary products and businesses, including a private credit fund and a new construction management consulting business.\n\nOverall, we made great strides during fiscal 2024. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we remain focused on further growing our core credit and real estate businesses, sourcing unique investment opportunities, and utilizing our strong balance sheet to expand our platform and create value for our shareholders.” \n\n**_Capital Raises to Scale Credit Platform_**\n\nGECC issued $56.5 million of 8.50% notes due 2029 (“GECCI”).

This investment was supported by a $3 million investment by GEG into PPH, with other institutional investors contributing $9 million.\n\nIn February 2024, GECC raised $24 million of equity capital from GESP that acquired GECC common stock at net asset value. GEG supported the capital raise by making a $6 million investment into the SPV alongside a large institutional investor that invested $18 million.\n\n**_Discussion of Financial Results for the Fiscal Fourth Quarter Ended June 30, 2024_**\n\nGEG reported total revenue of $8.9 million, approximately triple that of $3.0 million in the prior-year period. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by Monomoy BTS’s first build-to-suit property sale.\n\nGEG recorded net loss from continuing operations of ($0.6) million, compared to ($5.3) million in the prior-year period. Included in net loss was ($1.1) million unrealized loss on our investment in PPH during the quarter.\n\nGEG recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million, compared to $0.4 million in the prior-year period.\n\n**_Discussion of Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024_**\n\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 increased 106% to $17.8 million from $8.7 million in the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by the first build-to-suit property sale and increased incentive fees collected from GECC.\n\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations of ($0.9) million, compared to net income from continuing operations of $14.5 million for fiscal 2023, which was driven by significant gains from the sale of Forest Investments, Inc. Included in net loss for fiscal 2024 was ($3.8) million of unrealized losses on GEG’s investments in GESP and PPH.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 was $4.8 million, compared to $1.0 million in the prior fiscal year.\n\n**_Stock Repurchase Program and Convertible Notes Extinguishment_**\n\nIn the fiscal second quarter, GEG’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which GEG is authorized to repurchase up to $10 million in the aggregate of its outstanding common stock in the open market. To date, the Company has repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares for $2.4 million.\n\nIn addition, in June 2024, the Company repurchased $4.2 million in principal of 5% convertible notes due February 26, 2030 for $2.1 million, or approximately 47% of face value, resulting in a realized gain of $2.3 million.\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Conference Call & Webcast Information**\n\n**When:**|  Friday, August 30, 2024, 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET)  \n---|---  \n**Call:**|  All interested parties are invited to participate in the conference call by dialing +1 (877) 407-0752; international callers should dial +1 (201) 389-0912.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and represent Great Elm’s assumptions and expectations in light of currently available information. These statements involve risks, variables and uncertainties, and Great Elm’s actual performance results may differ from those projected, and any such differences may be material. For information on certain factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from Great Elm’s expectations, please see Great Elm’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

Adjusted EBITDA is derived from methodologies other than in accordance with US GAAP. Great Elm believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for investors to use in evaluating Great Elm’s businesses. In addition, Great Elm’s management reviews Adjusted EBITDA as they evaluate acquisition opportunities.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it either in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analyzing Great Elm’s results as reported under US GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by Great Elm may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\n\nIncluded in the financial tables below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure, net income from continuing operations.\n\n**Endnotes** 1 Pro forma FPAUM assumes full investment of incremental capital.\n\n**Media & Investor Contact:**Investor Relations [geginvestorrelations@greatelmcap.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Vmx3vw9xjpNojZuFDsjSwbhL5R_bGq7lGmmKJdngWKXvLMCEGUu2depr14kB5BvQde1EgpK5ZbjqyNHU11-jUFHcx2vFuIPRDwaHUbRfzl66-DSBQb0Q4EFwEK1F07o4Y_UPHue_aGtnIJf8TyC94g==)\n\n**Great Elm Group, Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets****Dollar amounts in thousands (except per share data)**\n\n**ASSETS**| **June 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nCurrent assets  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 48,147| $| 60,165  \nRestricted cash| 1,571| -

(“we,” “our,” “GEG,” “Great Elm,” or “the Company”), (NASDAQ: GEG), an alternative asset manager, today announced financial results for its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 and Other Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Great Elm Capital Corp. (“GECC”), raised approximately $58.5 million new capital since December 31, 2023, positioning GEG to grow management and incentive fee revenue.\n  * Fee-paying assets under management (“FPAUM”) and assets under management (“AUM”) increased 13% and 9%, respectively, from March 31, 2023.\n  * Pro forma FPAUM1 totaled approximately $521 million, up 19% from March 31, 2023, including the net proceeds from GECC’s April capital raising initiatives.\n  * Pro forma AUM totaled approximately $716 million, up 14% from March 31, 2023, including the net proceeds from GECC’s April capital raising initiatives.\n  * Great Elm collected incentive fees for the fourth consecutive quarter from GECC, totaling $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n  * Total revenue for the third quarter grew 47% to $2.8 million, compared to $1.9 million for the prior-year period.\n  * Net loss from continuing operations attributable to GEG was ($2.9) million for the third quarter, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of ($0.5) million in the prior year period. \n    * Net loss in the quarter was driven by an approximately ($2.9) million unrealized loss on our investment in Great Elm Strategic Partnership I, LLC during the quarter.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.2 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($0.3) million for the prior-year period.\n  * As of March 31, 2024, GEG had approximately $69 million of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet to support growth initiatives across its alternative asset management platform.\n  * Monomoy BTS signed a contract to sell its first build-to-suit property, expected to close in the fiscal fourth quarter, and added a material number of projects to its pipeline.\n  * Great Elm launched Monomoy BTS Construction Management, LLC, a consulting business providing owner representative services to key clients, adding another accretive revenue stream.\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nJason Reese, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “We continue to make solid progress in the quarter with respect to our long-term growth strategy. Completing successful capital raises of nearly $60 million at GECC, we are positioned to significantly grow our overall assets under management and related fee revenue. Additionally, GECC’s continued performance allowed Great Elm to earn incentive fees for the fourth consecutive quarter. At Monomoy, I’m increasingly encouraged by our growing backlog of build-to-suit projects, as well as the launch of a new construction management consulting business supported by our seasoned team and anchored by a key tenant contract. Upon the anticipated sale of our first build-to-suit property in fiscal fourth quarter, we will have created value for shareholders and believe we will be able to generate additional shareholder value over time by executing on our considerable BTS pipeline.”\n\n“Furthermore, we are committed to utilizing our strong and liquid balance sheet to grow and diversify our businesses and revenue streams. Overall, we remain focused on scaling our core credit and real estate businesses, launching new investment funds and deploying capital into attractive platform opportunities that offer compelling risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.” \n\n**_Capital Raises to Scale the Credit Platform_**\n\nIn February 2024, GECC raised $24 million of equity capital from a special purchase vehicle (“SPV”) that acquired GECC common stock at net asset value. GEG supported the capital raise by making a $6 million investment into the SPV with a large institutional investor that invested $18 million.\n\nIn April 2024, GECC completed an underwritten public offering of $34.5 million 8.50% notes due 2029 (“GECCI”).\n\n**_Discussion of Financial Results for the Fiscal Third Quarter Ended March 31, 2024_**\n\nGEG reported total revenue of $2.8 million, a 47% increase from $1.9 million in the prior-year period, primarily driven by the collection of incentive fees from GECC of $0.7 million.\n\nGEG recorded net loss from continuing operations of ($2.9) million, compared to a net loss of ($0.5) million in the prior-year period. Net loss in the quarter was driven by an approximately ($2.9) million unrealized loss on our investment in Great Elm Strategic Partnership I, LLC during the quarter.\n\nGEG recorded Adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($0.3) million in the prior-year period.\n\n**_Stock Repurchase Program_**\n\nIn the fiscal second quarter, GEG’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which GEG is authorized to repurchase up to $10 million in the aggregate of its outstanding common stock in the open market. To date, the Company has repurchased a modest number of shares.\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Conference Call & Webcast Information**\n\n**When:**|  Thursday, May 9, 2024, 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET)  \n---|---  \n**Call:**|  All interested parties are invited to participate in the conference call by dialing +1 (888) 440-4537; international callers should dial +1 (646) 960-0669.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and represent Great Elm’s assumptions and expectations in light of currently available information. These statements involve risks, variables and uncertainties, and Great Elm’s actual performance results may differ from those projected, and any such differences may be material. For information on certain factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from Great Elm’s expectations, please see Great Elm’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Additional information relating to Great Elm’s financial position and results of operations is also contained in Great Elm’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and available for download at its website [www.greatelmgroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=M3V7_i-ILC5Cz6lb6DF7XhJadcy46koroR8_PiITYZKnGPoxtyrxDfuz6Rhm35sB4ljD6wmO9YCq7MHKuRwMxbTkaxMFeNQR2-odJ4v-AZw=) or at the SEC website [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BoCGJpPEgBkaVLLu3R-ZnqqyNNDFW2hcDPd4qq4NQSLeX5RB43CAKOU5tYecbkCCcuZt2CbxH3goyC4a8yhNOA==).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC, and in public disclosures, of financial measures that are not in accordance with US GAAP, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA is derived from methodologies other than in accordance with US GAAP. Great Elm believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for investors to use in evaluating Great Elm’s businesses. In addition, Great Elm’s management reviews Adjusted EBITDA as they evaluate acquisition opportunities.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it either in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analyzing Great Elm’s results as reported under US GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by Great Elm may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\n\nIncluded in the financial tables below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure, net income from continuing operations.\n\n**Endnotes** 1 Pro forma FPAUM assumes full investment of incremental capital.\n\n**Media & Investor Contact:**Investor Relations [geginvestorrelations@greatelmcap.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WqJWw7GUOImeqgDJc747HwvX2ZM5cPp9Nfu_JFJmLV44h0x6txotKOzCeN367QkHDdzO5j8q29hqixCe1Nspri39PqYWwCNSzVFlESed9dDVfqZcxsQMXBljObD_qacnG_Fzg-wqcV-Tj736FfvrBw==)\n\n**Great Elm Group, Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)****Dollar amounts in thousands (except per share data)**\n\n**ASSETS**| **March 31, 2024**| **June 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nCurrent assets  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 44,085| $| 60,165  \nReceivables from managed funds| 4,400| 3,308  \nInvestments in marketable securities| 24,789| 24,595  \nInvestments, at fair value (cost $46,199 and $40,387, respectively)| 38,244| 32,611  \nPrepaid and other current assets| 2,843| 717  \nReal estate under development| 8,104| 1,742  \nAssets of Consolidated Funds:  \nCash and cash equivalents| 5,414| -

Organization\nGreat Elm Group, Inc. (referred to as the Company or GEG) is an alternative asset management company incorporated in Delaware. The Company focuses on\ngrowing a scalable and diversified portfolio of long-duration and permanent capital vehicles across credit, real estate, specialty finance, and other alternative\nstrategies.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Great Elm Capital\nManagement, LLC (GECM), Great Elm Opportunities GP, Inc. (GEO GP), Great Elm Capital GP, LLC (GEC GP), Great Elm Investments, LLC (GEI), Great\nElm FM Acquisition, Inc. (FM Acquisition), Great Elm DME Holdings, Inc. (DME Holdings), Monomoy CRE, LLC (MCRE), Monomoy BTS Construction\nManagement, LLC (MCM) and Monomoy BTS Corporation (MBTS). In addition, we have determined that the Company was the primary beneficiary of\ncertain variable interest entities, and therefore the operations of those entities have been included in our consolidated results for the relevant periods.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore,\ndo not include all information and footnotes that are normally included in the Company’s Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. These\nfinancial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring items or items discussed herein) that management believes are necessary to fairly\nstate results for the interim periods presented. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results of operations.\nThe historical results of our Durable Medical Equipment (DME) business and related activity have been presented in the accompanying consolidated statements\nof operations and cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as discontinued operations. Unless otherwise specified, disclosures in these\nconsolidated financial statements reflect continuing operations only.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) requires\nthe Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions. The most\nimportant of these estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, estimates associated with accounting for\nasset acquisitions, and fair value measurements, including stock-based compensation. Although these and other estimates and assumptions are based on the best\navailable information, actual results could be different from these estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company consolidates the assets, liabilities, and operating results of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, majority-owned subsidiaries, and subsidiaries in which\nwe hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. In most cases, a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the\nvoting interests. We consolidate a variable interest entity (VIE) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact\nits economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n8\nNon-controlling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries are reported as a component of equity, separate from the parent company’s equity or outside of\npermanent equity for non-controlling interests that are contingently redeemable. Results of operations attributable to the non-controlling interests are included in\nthe Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Cash\nequivalents consist primarily of exchange-traded money market funds and U.S. treasury bills. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by\nthe financial institutions or the issuers of these investments to the extent the amounts on deposit or invested are in excess of amounts that are insured.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities\nInvestments in marketable securities consist of debt securities, such as the U.S. treasury bills with original maturity exceeding 90 days. The Company classifies\ninvestments in debt securities as either trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale. Securities are classified as trading if they are purchased and held\nprincipally for the purpose of selling in the near term and as held-to-maturity when the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold the security to\nmaturity. Investments in debt securities not classified as either trading or held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale securities. Trading securities are\nmeasured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported within net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments. Held-to-maturity securities are\nmeasured at amortized cost with realized gains and losses reported within net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments. Available-for-sale securities are\nmeasured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nAs of September 30, 2024, all investments in marketable securities were classified as held-to-maturity and had original maturities (at the time of purchase)\nexceeding 90 days. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis for these securities approximated their fair value.\nInvestments, at Fair Value\nInvestments, at fair value, consist of equity and equity-related securities carried at fair value, as well as investments in private funds measured using the net\nasset value (NAV) as reported by each fund’s investment manager. The private funds calculate NAV in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946, Financial Services – Investment Companies, as of the\nvaluation date. Changes in the fair value and NAV are recorded within net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments. Dividends received are recorded\nwithin dividends and interest income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nReal Estate under Development\nReal estate under development is classified as follows: (i) real estate under development (current), which includes real estate projects that are in the process of\nbeing developed and expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date; (ii) real estate under development (non-current), which\nincludes real estate projects that are in the process of being developed and expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet\ndate; and (iii) real estate held for sale, which includes land and completed improvements thereon that meet all of the “held for sale” criteria.\nReal estate under development is carried at cost less impairment, if applicable. We capitalize costs that are directly identifiable with the specific real estate\nprojects, including pre-acquisition and pre-construction costs, development and construction costs, taxes, and insurance. We do not capitalize any general and\nadministrative or overhead costs, regardless of whether the costs are internal or paid to third parties. Capitalization begins when the activities related to\ndevelopment have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy.\nReal estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. If an asset’s fair value less cost to sell, based on discounted future cash\nflows, management estimates or market comparisons, is less than its carrying amount, an allowance is recorded against the asset.\n9\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include real estate under development, property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets, and lease right-of-use assets. The Company\nevaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable based on\nundiscounted cash flows. Impairment losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset’s carrying\namount. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value, which is determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, management estimates or market comparisons.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract considering all relevant facts and circumstances, which normally does not require\nsignificant judgment. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the\nCompany’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the\nlease based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in our leases is generally not readily\ndeterminable, we utilize the incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-\nuse assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.\nThe Company’s office leases typically require reimbursements to the lessor for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other operating costs, which are\nexpensed as incurred as variable lease costs. The Company accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component.\nIn March 2024, the Company signed a new office lease which is expected to commence in December 2024. As none of the criteria for recognition have been\nmet as of September 30, 2024, there is no corresponding lease liability or right-of-use asset associated with this lease included in the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nEarnings per Share\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:\nFor the three months ended September 30,\n(in thousands except per share amounts) 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income from continuing operations $ 2,974 $ 2,758\nLess: net income attributable to non-controlling interest, continuing operations 335 -\nNumerator for basic EPS - Net income from continuing operations attributable to Great Elm Group,\nInc. $ 2,639 $ 2,758\nNet income from discontinued operations - 16\nNumerator for basic EPS - Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, attributable to Great Elm\nGroup, Inc. $ - $ 16\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nInterest expense associated with Convertible Notes, continuing operations $ 470 $ 503\nNumerator for diluted EPS - Net income from continuing operations attributable to Great Elm Group,\nInc., after the effect of dilutive securities $ 3,109 $ 3,261\nNumerator for diluted EPS - Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, attributable to Great\nElm Group, Inc. $ - $ 16\nDenominator:\nDenominator for basic EPS - Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 29,079 29,579\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nRestricted stock 1,168 1,363\nConvertible Notes 10,222 10,918\nDenominator for diluted EPS - Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding after the effect\nof dilutive securities 40,469 41,860\nNet income attributable to shareholders per share(1)\nBasic $ 0.09 $ 0.09\nDiluted 0.08 0.08\n10\n(1) Per share amounts from discontinued operations round to less than $0.01.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 3,104,424 potential shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options that are not included in the\ndiluted net income (loss) per share calculation because to do so would be anti-dilutive for the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30,\n2023, the Company had 3,264,424 potential shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options that are not included in the diluted net income\n(loss) per share calculation for the three months ended September 30, 2023 because to do so would be anti-dilutive.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had an aggregate of 1,167,705 and 1,362,723 issued shares, respectively, that are not considered outstanding\nfor accounting purposes since they are unvested and subject to forfeiture by the employees at a nominal price if service milestones are not met.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIncome Taxes. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, to expand the\ndisclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments in\nthis ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, and early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. The Company is\nevaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue\nThe Company's revenues are summarized in the following table:\nFor the three months ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nReal estate property sales $ 616 $ -\nManagement fees 1,720 1,424\nIncentive fees 880 1,264\nProperty management fees 306 282\nProject management fees 75 -\nAdministration and service fees 395 340\nTotal revenues $ 3,992 $ 3,310\nThe Company recognizes revenue at amounts that reflect the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for providing services to its customers\nunder agreements with each investment product, which may be terminated at any time by either party subject to the specific terms of each respective agreement.\nReal estate property sales\nReal estate property sales will occur periodically when development projects are completed. Sales revenue and cost of sales revenue is generally recognized as\ncontrol of the asset is transferred to the buyer and performance obligations are satisfied. Please see Note 6 - Real Estate Under Development for additional\ninformation regarding real estate under development.\nManagement Fees\nThe Company earns management fees based on the investment management agreements between MCRE and Monomoy UpREIT, as well as between GECM\nand GECC, and other private funds (collectively, the Funds). The performance obligation is satisfied and management fee revenue is recognized over time as\nthe services are rendered, since the Funds simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided as GECM and MCRE perform services. Management fee\nrates range from 1.0% to 1.5% of the management fee assets specified within each agreement and are calculated and billed in arrears of the period, either\nmonthly or quarterly.\n11\nIncentive Fees\nThe Company earns incentive fees based on the investment management agreements GECM has with GECC, Monomoy Properties II, LLC (MP II), a feeder\nfund of Monomoy Properties REIT, LLC and other private funds managed by GECM. Where an investment management agreement includes both management\nfees and incentive fees, the performance obligation is considered to be a single obligation for both fees. Incentive fees are variable consideration associated with\nthe investment management agreements and therefore the recognition of such fees is deferred until the end of each fund's measurement period when the\nperformance based incentive fee becomes fixed and determinable. Incentive fees are earned based on investment performance during the period, subject to the\nachievement of minimum return levels or high-water marks, in accordance with the terms of the respective investment management agreements. Incentive fees\nare typically 20% of the performance-based metric specified within each agreement. Incentive fees are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer\nprobable of significant reversal. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded revenue in respect to the incentive fees due from\nGECC of $0.9 million.\nProperty Management Fees\nUnder the Monomoy UpREIT investment management agreement, MCRE is entitled to 4.0% of rent collected. These fees are collected monthly in arrears.\nProperty management fee revenue is recognized over time as the services are provided.\nAdministration and Service fees\nThe Company earns administration fees based on the administration agreement GECM has with GECC whereby GECC reimburses GECM for costs incurred in\nperforming certain administrative functions. This revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. Administration fees are billed quarterly in\narrears, which is consistent with the timing of the delivery of services and reflect agreed upon rates for the services provided. The services are accounted for as a\nsingle performance obligation for each investment vehicle that is a series of distinct services with substantially the same pattern of transfer as the services are\nprovided on a daily basis.\nThe Company also earns services fees based on a shared services agreement with Imperial Capital Asset Management, LLC (ICAM). This revenue is\nrecognized over time as the services are performed. Service fees are billed quarterly in arrears, which is consistent with the timing of the delivery of services\nand reflects agreed-upon rates for the services provided. The services are accounted for as a single performance obligation that is a series of distinct services\nwith substantially the same pattern of transfer as the services are provided on a daily basis.\nProject Management Fees\nMCM, a wholly owned subsidiary of MCRE, has entered into an owner’s representative agreement with respect to certain third party construction projects and\nearns project management fees for its services.\n4. Related Party Transactions\nRelated party transactions are measured in part by the amount of consideration paid or received as established and agreed by the parties. Consideration paid for\nsuch services in each case is the negotiated value.\nThe following tables summarize activity and outstanding balances between the managed investment products and the Company:\nFor the three months ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet realized and unrealized gain on investments $ 3,768 $ 3,362\nNet realized and unrealized gain on investments of Consolidated Funds 278 -\nDividend income 969 836\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nDividends receivable $ 301 $ 301\nInvestment management revenues receivable 2,890 1,684\nReceivable for reimbursable expenses paid 663 274\nReceivables from managed funds $ 3,854 $ 2,259\n12\nInvestment Management\nGECM has agreements to manage the investment portfolios for GECC and other investment products, as well as to provide administrative services. Through\nJune 30, 2024, GECM also had agreements with Monomoy UpREIT. The agreements with Monomoy UpREIT were transferred to MCRE on June 30, 2024.\nUnder these agreements, GECM receives management fees based on the managed assets (other than cash and cash equivalents) and rent collected, incentive\nfees based on the performance of those assets, and administration and service fees. See Note 3 - Revenue for additional discussions of the fee arrangements.\nConsolidated Funds\nThrough its wholly-owned subsidiaries GECM, MCRE and GEO GP, the Company serves as the investment manager, general partner, or managing member of\ncertain private funds, in which it may also have a direct investment. For funds which are determined to be VIEs and where it is determined that the Company is\nthe primary beneficiary, the criteria for consolidation are met. The Company monitors such funds and related criteria for consolidation on an ongoing basis.\nFunds that have historically been consolidated will be deconsolidated at such time as the Company is no longer deemed to be the primary beneficiary and will\nthen be treated as equity method investments.\nThe Company retains the specialized investment company accounting guidance under US GAAP with respect to the consolidated funds (collectively, the\nConsolidated Funds). As such, investments of the Consolidated Funds are included in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and the net realized and\nunrealized gain or loss on those investments was included as a component of other income on the consolidated statements of operations. Non-controlling\ninterests of the Consolidated Funds are included in net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest, continuing operations. The Company's risk with\nrespect to the Consolidated Funds is limited to its beneficial interests in these funds. The assets of Consolidated Funds are not available to creditors of the\nCompany. The creditors of Consolidated Funds do not have recourse to the Company other than to the assets of the respective Consolidated Funds.\nThe Company holds investments in certain funds that are VIEs but the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Such investments are treated as\nequity method investments and the Company has elected the fair value option using NAV as a practical expedient with all changes in fair value reported in net\nrealized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company's maximum exposure to loss related to the VIEs\nthat the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary is limited to the fair value of its investments in these entities.\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional details.\nInvestments\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company owns 1,440,722 shares of GECC (approximately 13.8% of the outstanding shares).

Reese, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman\nof the Company’s Board of Directors, is the Chief Executive Officer of ICAM, and Matt Kaplan, the President of GECM, is also a Managing Director of ICAM.\nCertain costs incurred under these agreements relate to human resources and other administrative services provided by ICAM employees, for the benefit of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries, and are included in investment management expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, such costs were $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Other costs include operational or administrative\nservices performed on behalf of the funds managed by GECM and are included in receivables from managed funds in the consolidated balance sheets. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, costs of $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, related to the shared services agreements were included in\nreceivables from managed funds.\nAs of January 1, 2024, GECM also has a shared personnel and reimbursement agreement with ICAM whereby ICAM reimburses certain costs incurred by\nGECM related to administrative services provided by GECM employees for the benefit of ICAM. See Note 3 - Revenue for additional details.\nOn October 29, 2024, the Company and Mr. Reese entered into a voting waiver agreement (the “Voting Waiver\nAgreement”), pursuant to which Mr. Reese waived all voting rights associated with all outstanding shares (whether\nvested or unvested) of the Company’s common stock for voting purposes that have been granted or awarded, and all\nfuture shares of the Company’s common stock that may be granted or awarded, directly to Mr. Reese in his\nindividual capacity by the Company in connection with his services as an officer, director or employee of the\nCompany or its subsidiaries during the term of the Voting Waiver Agreement.\nSee Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements for details on the contingent consideration payable to ICAM following the acquisition of the Monomoy UpREIT\ninvestment management agreement and Note 8 - Convertible Notes for details on the Convertible Notes issued to related parties.\n5. Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for\nthe asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nGAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\n▪ Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n▪ Level 2: Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities\nin active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n▪ Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value.\nThese assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nAll financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis have been segregated into the most appropriate level\nwithin the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date.\n14\nThe assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis are summarized in the tables below:\nFair Value as of September 30, 2024\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nEquity investments $ 14,714 $ - $ 8,744 $ 23,458\nDebt securities 7,460 - - 7,460\nTotal assets within the fair value hierarchy $ 22,174 $ - $ 8,744 $ 30,918\nInvestments valued at net asset value $ 24,099\nTotal assets $ 55,017\nFair Value as of June 30, 2024\n(in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nEquity investments $ 16,267 $ - $ 5,265 $ 21,532\nDebt securities $ 9,929 $ - $ - $ 9,929\nTotal assets within the fair value hierarchy $ 26,196 $ - $ 5,265 $ 31,461\nInvestments valued at net asset value $ 23,053\nTotal assets $ 54,514\nLiabilities:\nContingent consideration liability $ - $ - $ 428 $ 428\nTotal liabilities $ - $ - $ 428 $ 428\nThere were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following is a reconciliation of changes in Level 3 assets:\nFor the three months ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 5,265 $ -\nPurchases - -\nPayments - -\nChange in fair value 3,479 -\nEnding balance $ 8,744 $ -\nThere were no assets measured at fair value during the period ended September 30, 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Level 3 assets still held\nas of the balance sheet date had a decrease in unrealized gain of $2,510.\nThe valuation techniques applied to investments held by the Company and by the Consolidated Funds varied depending on the nature of the investment.\nEquity and equity-related securities\nSecurities traded on a national securities exchange are stated at the close price on the valuation date. To the extent these securities are actively traded and\nvaluation adjustments are not applied, they are classified as Level 1.\nEquity investments that do not have readily-available market prices utilize valuation models to determine fair value and are classified as Level 3. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had equity investments in two private companies that were valued using a discounted cash flows model with discount rates\nranging from 9.3% - 12.6% (weighted average 10.3%). As of June 30, 2024, the Company valued the investments using an options pricing model with a\nvolatility ranging from 39.1% - 39.7% (weighted average 39.5%) and risk-free rates of 4.24% - 4.38% (weighted average 4.29%). The change in valuation\ntechnique was due to additional information about the assumptions used by market participants and transactional experience.\nDebt securities\nBank loans, corporate debt and other debt obligations traded on a national exchange are valued based on quoted market prices and classified as Level 2. Debt\ninvestments that are not actively traded are generally based on discounted cash flows and classified as Level 3. The following table below presents the ranges\nof significant unobservable inputs used to value Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024\nInvestment Type Fair value Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range (Weighted Average)\nDebt $ 7,291 Income Approach Discount Rate 8.10% - 20.83% (12.4%)\n404 Recent Transaction\nTotal Debt $ 7,695\nEquity/Other 4 Recent Transaction\nTotal Equity/Other $ 4\n16\nAs of June 30, 2024\nInvestment Type Fair value Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range (Weighted Average)\nDebt $ 7,193 Income Approach Discount Rate 9.09% - 25.03% (13.81%)\n578 Recent Transaction\nTotal Debt $ 7,771\nEquity/Other 10 Market Approach Earnings Multiple 7.5\nTotal Equity/Other $ 10\nInvestments in private funds\nThe Company values investments in private funds using NAV as reported by each fund’s investment manager. The private funds calculate NAV in a manner\nconsistent with the measurement principles of FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services – Investment Companies, as of the valuation date. Investments valued\nusing NAV as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, investments in private funds include investments in Monomoy UpREIT, Monomoy Properties II, LLC (MP II)\nand Great Elm Opportunities Fund I, LP Series D (GEOF Series D), each of which is managed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in addition to\nprivate funds managed by third-party investment managers. The private funds generally allow redemptions annually with 60-90 days’ notice. There is no set\nduration for the private funds.\nContingent consideration\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of the Monomoy UpREIT investment and property management agreements in May 2022, the Company entered into a\ncontingent consideration agreement that requires the Company to pay up to $2.0 million to ICAM if certain fee revenue thresholds were achieved during fiscal\nyears ending June 30, 2023 and 2024. As of June 30, 2023, the Company determined that the fee revenue threshold for the year ending June 30, 2023 was\nachieved and the amount payable to ICAM was approximately $1.0 million, which was paid in July 2023. As of June 30, 2024, it was determined that the full\ntarget revenue threshold for the year ended June 30, 2024 was not met in full and the contingent consideration was updated to $0.4 million, which was paid in\nJuly 2024.\n6. Real Estate Under Development\nIn January 2023, MBTS completed purchases of certain land parcels located in Mississippi and Florida. Contemporaneously with the land purchases, MBTS\nentered into commercial lease agreements, as a lessor, in respect to the land parcels and build-to-suit improvements to be constructed thereon. The leases will\ncommence upon substantial completion of the build-to-suit development. The Company intends to sell the land and improvements with the attached leases at or\nclose to the respective lease commencement date.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company capitalized costs of $17 thousand and $1.4 million, respectively, within real estate\nunder development (current) on its condensed consolidated balance sheet, representing the development and construction costs directly identifiable with the two\nreal estate projects.\nOn June 18, 2024, MBTS sold one of its assets for consideration totaling $7.8 million. At closing, MBTS funded two escrow accounts as part of its\nperformance obligation to seller for construction completion. As of September 30, 2024, the Company estimates that construction is approximately 92.6%\ncomplete and has recognized revenue proportionately. The Company expects the performance obligation will be satisfied over the subsequent calendar quarter\nand the remaining sales revenue will be recognized at that time.\n17\n7. Long-Term Debt\nOn June 9, 2022, we issued $26.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% notes due on June 30, 2027 (the GEGGL Notes), which included $1.9\nmillion of GEGGL Notes issued in connection with the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. The GEGGL Notes are unsecured obligations\nand rank: (i) pari passu, or equal, with the Convertible Notes (as defined below) and any future outstanding unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness; (ii) senior\nto any of our indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the GEGGL Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to any future secured indebtedness; and\n(iv) structurally subordinated to any future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our current and future subsidiaries. We pay interest on the GEGGL\nNotes on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year. The GEGGL Notes can be called on, or after, June 30, 2024. Holders of the GEGGL\nNotes do not have the option to have the notes repaid prior to the stated maturity date. The GEGGL Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $25 and\nintegral multiples of $25 in excess thereof.\nThe Company’s long-term debt is summarized in the following table:\n(in thousands) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024\nGEGGL Notes $ 26,945 $ 26,945\nTotal principal $ 26,945 $ 26,945\nUnamortized debt discounts and issuance costs (785) (855)\nLong-term debt 26,160 26,090\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company incurred interest expense of $0.6 million and $0.6 million, on long-\nterm debt. See Note 8 - Convertible Notes for interest expense on Convertible Notes.\nThe GEGGL Notes include covenants that limit additional indebtedness or the payment of dividends subject to compliance with a net consolidated debt to\nequity ratio of 2:1. As of September 30, 2024, our net consolidated debt to equity ratio is 0.3:1.0.\n8. Convertible Notes\nAs of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the total outstanding principal balance of convertible notes due on February 26, 2030 (the Convertible Notes)\nwas $35.5 million, including cumulative interest paid in-kind. The Convertible Notes are held by a consortium of investors, including $16.2 million issued to\ncertain related parties as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Convertible Notes accrue interest at 5.0% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 31, commencing June 30, 2020, in cash or\nin kind at the option of the Company. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes are convertible into 288.0018 shares of the Company’s common\nstock, subject to the terms therein, prior to maturity at the option of the holder. Funds managed by ICAM currently own\napproximately $7.9 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which are currently convertible\ninto approximately 2,284,461 shares of the Company’s common stock. ICAM has agreed to not convert its\nConvertible Notes into shares of the Company’s common stock prior to November 2025.\nThe Company may, subject to compliance with the terms of the Convertible Notes, effect the conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes into shares of\ncommon stock, subject to certain liquidity and pricing requirements, as specified in the Convertible Notes.\nThe embedded conversion feature in the Convertible Notes qualifies for the scope exception to derivative accounting in FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and\nHedging, for certain contracts involving a reporting entity’s own equity. The Company incurred $1.2 million in issuance costs on the original issuance. The debt\nissuance costs are being amortized over the 10-year term and are netted with the principal balance on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the remaining balance of unamortized debt issuance costs was $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred interest expense of $0.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to\nthe Convertible Notes, inclusive of non-cash interest related to amortization of debt issuance costs.\n18\n9.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had unrecognized compensation costs related\nto all unvested restricted stock awards and stock options totaling $2.1 million.\nNon-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan\nIn December 2020, the Company established the Great Elm Group, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Plan allowing non-employee\ndirectors to defer their cash and/or equity compensation under a non-revocable election for each calendar year. Such compensation is deferred until the earlier of\n3 years from the original grant date of such compensation, termination of service, or death, and is payable in common stock shares. As of September 30, 2024,\nthere were 162,683 restricted stock awards and restricted stock units that were deferred under this plan (and thus included in the number of restricted stock\nawards and restricted stock units outstanding as of that date).\nOther Non-Cash Compensation\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued compensation to certain employees in the form of GECC common shares to be settled\nwith GECC shares currently held by the Company.

The Company\nmaintains insurance to mitigate losses related to certain risks. The Company is not a named party in any other pending or threatened litigation that we expect to\nhave a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n20\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOverview\nGEG is a publicly-traded alternative asset management company focused on growing a scalable and diversified portfolio of long-duration and permanent capital\nvehicles across credit, real estate, specialty finance, and other alternative strategies. GEG and its subsidiaries currently manage GECC, a publicly-traded\nbusiness development company, and Monomoy UpREIT, an industrial-focused real estate investment trust, in addition to other investment vehicles. The\ncombined assets under management of these entities at September 30, 2024 was approximately $781.6 million.\nGEG continues to explore other investment management opportunities, as well as opportunities in other areas that it believes provide attractive risk-adjusted\nreturns on invested capital. As of the date of this report, GEG had no unfunded binding commitments to make additional investments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared\nin accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires our\nmanagement to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. These items are monitored and analyzed by our management for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in\nthese estimates could occur in the future. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 we did not make material changes in our critical accounting\npolicies or underlying assumptions as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 as it relates to normal and recurring\ntransactions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table provides the results of our consolidated operations:\nFor the three months ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 Percent Change 2023\nRevenues $ 3,992 21% $ 3,310\nCost of Revenues (635) NM -\nOperating costs and expenses:\nInvestment management expenses, excluding non-cash compensation (2,237) (5)% (2,357)\nNon-cash compensation (1,117) 26% (887)\nOther selling, general and administrative (1,726) 40% (1,233)\nDepreciation and amortization (273) (4)% (283)\nTotal operating costs and expenses (5,353) (4,760)\nOperating loss (1,996) (1,450)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (1,028) (3)% (1,062)\nOther income (expense), net 5,998 14% 5,270\nTotal other income (expense), net 4,970 4,208\nIncome before income taxes from continuing operations $ 2,974 $ 2,758\nRevenue\nRevenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $0.7 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to\nthe recognition of $0.6 million of real estate property sales earned in the current quarter whereas there were no corresponding real estate property sales in the\nprior year period. An additional $0.3 million of management fees were also recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior\nyear period due to increased assets under management at GECC, offset by a $0.4 million reduction in Incentive Fees.\n21\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nOperating costs and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $0.6 million as compared to the prior year period. Investment\nmanagement expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $0.1 million as compared to the prior year period, which was mainly\nattributable to a decrease in bonus expense compared to the prior year period. Non-cash compensation for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased\n$0.2 million as compared to the prior year period due to additional shares vested in the current period compared to the same prior year period. Other selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased $0.5 million, which was mainly attributable to an increase in\nprofessional fees from the prior year period.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense), net includes dividend and interest income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses. For the three months ended September 30,\n2024, dividend and interest income was $1.6 million, as compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The $0.4 million decrease in\ninterest income in the current period compared to prior year is due to a reduction in investment in Treasury bills. Net realized and unrealized gains and losses\ngenerally consist of unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on investments and the gain or loss realized on the sale of investments. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, realized and unrealized gain increased by $0.5 million from the same prior year period. This increase was primarily due to $3.5 million of\nunrealized gains recorded in the current period on GESP and PPH due to the valuation technique change for these entities. These were offset by a significant\nGECC share price increase in the prior year period, which did not occur in the current corresponding period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nCash used in operating activities of our continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $5.8 million. The adjustments to reconcile\nour net income from continuing operations of $3.0 million to net cash used in operating activities included add-backs for various non-cash charges, such as $0.7\nmillion of stock-based compensation expense, $0.5 million of non-cash interest and amortization of capitalized issuance costs, $0.6 million realized gain on\ninvestments and $0.3 million of depreciation and amortization, which was offset by a deduction of $4.4 million of unrealized gain on our investments, and the\nnet negative change in our operating assets and liabilities of $7.2 million, including the impact of changes related to consolidated funds.\nCash flows used in operating activities of our continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $6.1 million. The adjustments to\nreconcile our net income from continuing operations of $2.8 million to net cash used in operating activities included add-backs for various non-cash charges,\nsuch as $0.7 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.6 million of non-cash interest and amortization of capitalized issuance costs, $0.3 million of\ndepreciation and amortization, and $0.1 million of realized loss on our investments, which was offset by deduction of $3.4 million of unrealized gain on our\ninvestments, and the net negative change in our operating assets and liabilities of $7.0 million.\nCash provided by investing activities of our continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $2.5 million, which includes purchases\nof investments in held-to-maturity securities of $7.4 million and proceeds from settlement of held-to-maturity investments of $10.0 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities of our continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $12.6 million which is attributed to\npurchases on investments of $14.3 million, partially offset by the proceeds from sale of investments of $1.8 million. Cash flows used in investing activities of\nour discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $0.4 million, which represents the payment made to the buyer of our DME\nbusiness in September 2023 following finalization of the working capital adjustment.\nCash used in financing activities of our continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $2.2 million primarily due to stock\nrepurchases.\nWe did not have any cash flows within financing activities of our continuing or discontinued operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n22\nFinancial Condition\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had an unrestricted cash balance of $44.2 million and $7.5 million in marketable securities. We also held 1,440,722 shares of\nGECC common stock with an estimated fair value of $14.7 million as of September 30, 2024. We believe we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our\nshort-term and long-term obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nBorrowings\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $26.9 million in outstanding aggregate principal amount of 7.25% notes due on June 30, 2027 (the GEGGL\nNotes). Interest on the GEGGL Notes is paid quarterly. The GEGGL Notes include covenants that limit additional indebtedness or the payment of dividends in\nthe event that our net consolidated debt to equity ratio is, or would be on a pro forma basis, greater than 2 to 1. In addition, if our net consolidated debt to equity\nratio is greater than 2 to 1 at the end of any calendar quarter, we must retain no less than 10% of our excess cash flow as cash and cash equivalents until such\ntime as our net consolidated debt to equity ratio is less than 2 to 1 at the end of a calendar quarter.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $35.5 million principal balance in convertible notes outstanding (including cumulative interest paid in-kind). The\nconvertible notes are held by a consortium of investors, including related parties. The convertible notes accrue interest at 5.0% per annum, payable\nsemiannually in arrears on June 30 and December 31, in cash or in kind at the option of the Company. The convertible notes are due on February 26, 2030, but\nare convertible at the option of the holders, subject to the terms therein, prior to maturity into shares of our common stock. Upon conversion of any note, the\nCompany will pay or deliver, as the case may be, to the noteholder, in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of notes being converted, shares of common\nstock equal to the conversion rate in effect on the conversion date, together with cash, if applicable, in lieu of delivering any fractional share of common stock.\nTo date, all interest on these instruments has been paid in-kind.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThere have been no material changes in the market risks discussed in Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nWe evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024.

Moreover, the Monomoy Build-to-Suit pipeline remains strong, and we continue to broaden our tenant relationships.”\n\n“Additionally, as the Great Elm Credit Income Fund marks its first anniversary, our strong returns and now-established track record position us well to attract capital and further scale the platform. We also increased our stock repurchase capacity up to $20 million from $10 million initially, and utilized the program to repurchase shares at a meaningful discount to book value. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities: growing our core credit and real estate platforms, pursuing compelling investment opportunities and leveraging our strong balance sheet to maximize shareholder value.”\n\n**GEG Managed Vehicle Highlights**\n\n  * GECC reported record total investment income in the quarter and was active in managing its capital structure. \n    * In July, GECC utilized its shelf to issue $22.0 million of 8.50% Notes due 2029 in a registered direct offering to an institutional investor.\n    * GECC issued $41.4 million of 8.125% Notes due 2029, utilizing the proceeds and cash on hand to redeem $45.3 million of notes scheduled to mature in January 2025, leaving no maturities until June 2026.\n    * GECC reported $11.7 million of total investment income, a record and the highest cash income in its history.\n  * Monomoy BTS and Monomoy REIT continued to execute on positive momentum from the prior quarter. \n    * Monomoy BTS completed construction of its first build-to-suit property in October 2024, following the property sale in June 2024, and ended the quarter with a strong pipeline in its Construction Management business.\n    * Monomoy REIT monetized approximately $7.1 million of real estate at a gain and enhanced its lease position.\n  * Great Elm Credit Income Fund (“GECIF”) delivered a strong return on invested capital of over 11%, net of fees, through September 30, 2024, since its inception in November 2023.3 \n\n\n\n**_Discussion of Financial Results for the Fiscal First Quarter Ended September 30, 2024_**\n\nGEG reported total revenue of $4.0 million, up 21% from $3.3 million in the prior-year period.\n\nGEG recorded net income from continuing operations of $3.0 million, compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and represent Great Elm’s assumptions and expectations in light of currently available information. These statements involve risks, variables and uncertainties, and Great Elm’s actual performance results may differ from those projected, and any such differences may be material. For information on certain factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from Great Elm’s expectations, please see Great Elm’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Additional information relating to Great Elm’s financial position and results of operations is also contained in Great Elm’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and available for download at its website [www.greatelmgroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GmzTm6_inMraoAdsn5L6IEyojMrxPTy_20Azxd4Spfrvwmq2tLM-pWrpsr4l7jgSbPOeU5HWYBqfFOgIdAxuGOWjJyGgaV7LLcxfifvl4gM=) or at the SEC website [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PGJ_-EWDaEag5jspSZE2ImHsd8jsTup1d2zG-_iqMuYamk4g5Mz2YnWDlgQj1xa_NmREI2rQsFmMcGI87pKRWQ==).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC, and in public disclosures, of financial measures that are not in accordance with US GAAP, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA is derived from methodologies other than in accordance with US GAAP. Great Elm believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for investors to use in evaluating Great Elm’s businesses. In addition, Great Elm’s management reviews Adjusted EBITDA as they evaluate acquisition opportunities.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it either in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analyzing Great Elm’s results as reported under US GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by Great Elm may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\n\nIncluded in the financial tables below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure, net income from continuing operations.\n\n**Endnotes** 1 Pro forma FPAUM incorporates net proceeds from $5.4 million of GECC 8.125% Notes due 2029 issued in October as well as the redemption in October of $45.3 million of GECC 6.75% Notes due January 2025. 2 Cash and marketable securities include approximately $40 thousand of restricted cash. 3 Assumes invested at inception on November 1, 2023, and remained invested throughout the succeeding eleven months, net of fees and expenses.
