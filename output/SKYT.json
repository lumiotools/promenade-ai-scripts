The actual results of the Company may differ from its expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “budget,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “believes,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.

Most of these factors are outside the Company’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: the inability to maintain the listing of the Company’s Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market; the ability of the Company to grow and manage growth profitably and retain its key employees; the Company’s ongoing leadership transitions; changes in applicable laws or regulations; the ability of the Company to raise financing in the future; the success, cost and timing of the Company’s product development and commercialization activities; the commercialization and adoption of the Company’s existing products and the success of any product the Company may offer in the future; the potential attributes and benefits of the Company’s commercialized Platinum® protein sequencing instrument and kits and the Company’s other products once commercialized; the Company’s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for its products, and any related restrictions and limitations of any approved product; the Company’s ability to identify, in-license or acquire additional technology; the Company’s ability to maintain its existing lease, license, manufacture and supply agreements; the Company’s ability to compete with other companies currently marketing or engaged in the development or commercialization of products and services that serve customers engaged in proteomic analysis, many of which have greater financial and marketing resources than the Company; the size and growth potential of the markets for the Company’s products and services, and its ability to serve those markets once commercialized, either alone or in partnership with others; the Company’s estimates regarding future expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; the Company’s financial performance; and other risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in the Company’s other filings with the SEC.

(NASDAQ: SKYT), the trusted technology realization partner, today announced financial results for the third quarter 2024 ended September 29, 2024. \n\n**Financial Highlights for Q3 2024:**\n\n  * Revenue increased 31% year-over-year to a record $93.8 million. \n  * Gross margin increased to 21.6% on a GAAP basis, compared to 19.8% in Q3 2023, and increased to 22.3% on a non-GAAP basis, compared to 20.4% in Q3 2023. \n  * Net income to shareholders of $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and net income to shareholders of $3.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, compared to net loss to shareholders of $7.6 million, or $(0.16) per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and net loss to shareholders of $2.2 million, or $(0.05) per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis in Q3 2023. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $11.0 million, or 11.7% of revenue, compared to $8.3 million, or 11.6% of revenue in Q3 2023. \n\n\n\n“I’m pleased to announce a strong third quarter for SkyWater, with new records achieved in both revenues and earnings,” commented Thomas Sonderman, CEO. “With further improvements in operational efficiencies and strong execution on a significant A&D program, we achieved upside in gross margins and adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect a return to sequential growth in Q4 in our Advanced Technology Services (ATS) business, which we expect will result in an overall robust revenue growth year for SkyWater in 2024. We are encouraged by a strong pipeline of A&D customer demand, increasing momentum in multiple emerging commercial programs, and a continued cadence of customer-funded CapEx investments. As we look ahead to 2025, with our current visibility we are forecasting year-over-year growth for our ATS business, an improving quarterly run rate for Wafer Services, and continued positive momentum in margins and operational leverage.” \n\n**Recent Business Highlights:**\n\n  * Achieved 9th straight record revenue quarter driven by over $30 million in customer-funded CapEx investments. This unprecedented level of investment by our customers is expected to significantly bolster our capabilities and capacity in both Minnesota and Florida, enabling strong future revenue growth potential in the years to come. \n  * Strong gross margin and earnings performance for Q3 exceeded expectations, driven by our continued focus on operational efficiencies and improved execution on a significant A&D program, which enabled us to deliver key milestones with lower-than-expected costs and recover the majority of the $8 million cost accrual recorded in Q1. \n  * Continuing our leadership in critical semiconductor technologies, SkyWater has been selected as a key performer on multiple Microelectronics (ME) Commons projects. These projects are focused on scalable low-power microtechnology technologies for AI hardware and other applications. The ME Commons is an important element of the CHIPS Act, supporting emerging technologies for national security. \n  * Continued momentum in our commercial ATS business culminated in a new multi-year supply agreement with NanoDx, Inc., a pioneer of in vitro diagnostic and biosensing applications. \n  * Exciting progress in Florida included the appointment of Bassel Haddad, SVP and GM of our advanced packaging business, where he is charged with building and scaling this important new growth vector for SkyWater.

ATS development revenue of $56.4 million increased 5% year-over-year. Wafer Services revenue of $6.7 million decreased 54% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Tools revenue was $30.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Gross Profit:** GAAP gross profit was $20.2 million, or 21.6% of total revenue, compared to gross profit of $14.1 million, or 19.8% of total revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross profit was $20.9 million, or 22.3% of total revenue, compared to non-GAAP gross profit of $14.6 million, or 20.4% of total revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. In the third quarter of 2024 we successfully modified a significant customer contract that resulted in a decrease in our estimate of future costs to complete their program. Gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 benefited from the $5.6 million reversal of the remaining loss accrual, which was initially established at $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 for this program. \n  * **Operating Expenses:** GAAP operating expenses were $15.5 million, compared to $18.3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $14.1 million, compared to $13.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Net Income (Loss):** GAAP net income to shareholders was $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss to shareholders of $7.6 million, or $(0.16) per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income to shareholders was $3.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss to shareholders of $2.2 million, or $(0.05) diluted per share, in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Adjusted EBITDA** : Adjusted EBITDA was $11.0 million, or 11.7% of total revenue, compared to $8.3 million, or 11.6% of total revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\nA reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is contained in the tables included in the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” \n\n**Q4 2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $72 million to $76 million, of which approximately $11 million is expected to be tools revenue. We expect GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $(0.12) to $(0.06) and non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $(0.10) to $(0.04). \n\nThis outlook for non-GAAP diluted EPS excludes anticipated equity-based compensation expense of approximately $2.0 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\n**Investor Webcast**\n\nSkyWater will host a conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 3:30 p.m. CT to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results.

services, tool installation and qualification services, facility and tool access, and security services.   \n(2)  |  Tools revenue and cost of tools revenue represents GAAP revenue and cost primarily derived from the procurement and subsequent sale of equipment to our customers. While this equipment is owned by our customers, the equipment is retained in one of our fabs and is used to complete ATS customer programs.   \n(3)  |  In the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $8,004 charge to recognize future estimated losses for one significant customer program based on anticipated cost increases to complete the customer’s program. In the third quarter of 2024 we successfully modified the customer contract, which resulted in a decrease in our estimate of future costs to complete their program. The remaining $5,616 loss accrual recorded at the time the contract was modified was released, which reduced cost of revenue for the three- and nine-months ended September 29, 2024.   \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe provide supplemental, non-GAAP financial information that our management regularly evaluates to provide additional insight to investors as supplemental information to our results reported using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We provide non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense, non-GAAP net income (loss) to shareholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) to shareholders per basic share and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to make informed operating decisions, complete strategic planning, prepare annual budgets, and evaluate Company and management performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful performance measures to our investors because they provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our business and exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings release should not be viewed as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, other companies, including our peers, may calculate their non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do. As a result, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. \n\nWe also provide earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as supplemental non-GAAP measures. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance, including net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; business transformation costs; management transition expense; the cost of severance, separation and other termination benefits; and the cost of CHIPS Act specialist fees. Our management uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to make informed operating decisions, complete strategic planning, prepare annual budgets, and evaluate Company and management performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful performance measures to our investors because they allow for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to other companies, including our peers, without regard to financing methods or capital structures. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin because the amounts of these items can vary substantially within our industry depending on the accounting methods and policies used, book values of assets, capital structures, and the methods by which assets were acquired. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost bases of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in these non-GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in these non-GAAP financial measures should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, unless otherwise expressly indicated. \n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the most directly comparable financial measures, calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to our non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n**SKYWATER TECHNOLOGY, INC.** **Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures** (Unaudited)   \n---  \n**Three-Month Period Ended** |  **Nine-Month Period

          "content": "SkyWater Technology Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nRecord Revenues with Increased Gross Margin and Earnings\nBLOOMINGTON, Minn., – November 7, 2024 – SkyWater Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: SKYT), the trusted\ntechnology realization partner, today announced financial results for the third quarter 2024 ended September 29,\n2024.\nFinancial Highlights for Q3 2024:\n• Revenue increased 31% year-over-year to a record $93.8 million.\n• Gross margin increased to 21.6% on a GAAP basis, compared to 19.8% in Q3 2023, and increased to 22.3%\non a non-GAAP basis, compared to 20.4% in Q3 2023.\n• Net income to shareholders of $1.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and net income to\nshareholders of $3.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, compared to net loss to\nshareholders of $7.6 million, or $(0.16) per diluted share on a GAAP basis, and net loss to shareholders of\n$2.2 million, or $(0.05) per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis in Q3 2023.\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $11.0 million, or 11.7% of revenue, compared to $8.3 million, or 11.6% of revenue in Q3\n2023.\n“I’m pleased to announce a strong third quarter for SkyWater, with new records achieved in both revenues and\nearnings,” commented Thomas Sonderman, CEO. “With further improvements in operational efficiencies and strong\nexecution on a significant A&D program, we achieved upside in gross margins and adjusted EBITDA during the\nquarter. Looking ahead, we expect a return to sequential growth in Q4 in our Advanced Technology Services (ATS)\nbusiness, which we expect will result in an overall robust revenue growth year for SkyWater in 2024. We are\nencouraged by a strong pipeline of A&D customer demand, increasing momentum in multiple emerging commercial\nprograms, and a continued cadence of customer-funded CapEx investments. As we look ahead to 2025, with our\ncurrent visibility we are forecasting year-over-year growth for our ATS business, an improving quarterly run rate for\nWafer Services, and continued positive momentum in margins and operational leverage.”\nRecent Business Highlights:\n• Achieved 9th straight record revenue quarter driven by over $30 million in customer-funded CapEx\ninvestments. This unprecedented level of investment by our customers is expected to significantly bolster\nour capabilities and capacity in both Minnesota and Florida, enabling strong future revenue growth potential\nin the years to come.\n• Strong gross margin and earnings performance for Q3 exceeded expectations, driven by our continued focus\non operational efficiencies and improved execution on a significant A&D program, which enabled us to deliver\nkey milestones with lower-than-expected costs and recover the majority of the $8 million cost accrual\nrecorded in Q1.\n• Continuing our leadership in critical semiconductor technologies, SkyWater has been selected as a key\nperformer on multiple Microelectronics (ME) Commons projects. These projects are focused on scalable low-\npower microtechnology technologies for AI hardware and other applications. The ME Commons is an\nimportant element of the CHIPS Act, supporting emerging technologies for national security.\n1\n• Continued momentum in our commercial ATS business culminated in a new multi-year supply agreement with\nNanoDx, Inc., a pioneer of in vitro diagnostic and biosensing applications.\n• Exciting progress in Florida included the appointment of Bassel Haddad, SVP and GM of our advanced\npackaging business, where he is charged with building and scaling this important new growth vector for\nSkyWater. During the quarter, we continued to place orders for new tooling, funded by the $120 million award\nannounced earlier in the year.\nQ3 2024 Summary:\nGAAP\nIn millions, except per share data Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Y/Y * Q2 2024 Q/Q *\nATS development revenue (1) $56.4 $53.9 5% $61.7 (9)%\nWafer Services revenue $6.7 $14.5 (54)% $5.8 16%\nCombined ATS development and Wafer\nServices revenue $63.1 $68.4 (8)% $67.4 (6)%\nTools revenue (2) $30.7 $3.2 847% $25.9 19%\nTotal revenue * $93.8 $71.6 31% $93.3 1%\nGross profit * $20.2 $14.1 43% $17.1 18%\nGross margin * 21.6% 19.8% 180 bps 18.3% 330 bps\nNet income (loss) to shareholders $1.5 $(7.6) NM $(1.9) NM\nBasic income (loss) per share $0.03 $(0.16) NM $(0.04) NM\nDiluted income (loss) per share $0.03 $(0.16) NM $(0.04) NM\nNet income (loss) margin to shareholders 1.6% (10.6)% 1,220 bps (2.0)% 360 bps\n__________________\nNM - Not meaningful\n* Amounts calculated based on figures reported in thousands.\n(1) ATS development revenue represents GAAP revenue primarily derived from process development services, tool installation and qualification\nservices, facility and tool access, and security services.\n(2) Tools revenue represents GAAP revenue primarily derived from the procurement and subsequent sale of equipment to our customers. While\nthis equipment is owned by our customers, the equipment is retained in one of our fabs and is used to complete ATS customer programs.\nNon-GAAP\nIn millions, except per share data Q3 2024 Q3 2023 Y/Y * Q2 2024 Q/Q *\nNon-GAAP gross profit $20.9 $14.6 43% $17.6 19%\nNon-GAAP gross margin * 22.3% 20.4% 190 bps 18.9% 340 bps\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) to shareholders $3.6 $(2.2) NM $0.8 (363)%\nNon-GAAP basic income (loss) per share $0.08 $(0.05) NM $0.02 300%\nNon-GAAP diluted income (loss) per share $0.08 $(0.05) NM $0.02 300%\nAdjusted EBITDA $11.0 $8.3 33% $8.1 35%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 11.7% 11.6% 10 bps 8.7% 300 bps\n__________________\nNM - Not meaningful\n* Amounts calculated based on figures reported in thousands.\nQ3 2024 Results:\n• Revenue: Revenue of $93.8 million increased 31% year-over-year.

In the third quarter of 2024 we successfully modified a significant customer contract\nthat resulted in a decrease in our estimate of future costs to complete their program. Gross margin for the\nthird quarter of 2024 benefited from the $5.6 million reversal of the remaining loss accrual, which was initially\nestablished at $8.0 million in the first quarter of 2024 for this program.\n• Operating Expenses: GAAP operating expenses were $15.5 million, compared to $18.3 million in the third\nquarter of 2023.

access, and security services.\n(2) Tools revenue and cost of tools revenue represents GAAP revenue and cost primarily derived from the procurement and subsequent sale of\nequipment to our customers. While this equipment is owned by our customers, the equipment is retained in one of our fabs and is used to\ncomplete ATS customer programs.\n(3) In the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $8,004 charge to recognize future estimated losses for one significant customer program based on\nanticipated cost increases to complete the customer’s program. In the third quarter of 2024 we successfully modified the customer contract,\nwhich resulted in a decrease in our estimate of future costs to complete their program. The remaining $5,616 loss accrual recorded at the\ntime the contract was modified was released, which reduced cost of revenue for the three- and nine-months ended September 29, 2024.\n8\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe provide supplemental, non-GAAP financial information that our management regularly evaluates to provide\nadditional insight to investors as supplemental information to our results reported using U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP). We provide non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross\nmargin, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense, non-\nGAAP net income (loss) to shareholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) to shareholders per basic share and non-\nGAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to make\ninformed operating decisions, complete strategic planning, prepare annual budgets, and evaluate Company and\nmanagement performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful performance measures to our\ninvestors because they provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our business and exclude certain items that may\nnot be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings release\nshould not be viewed as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the reported results prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. In addition, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, other\ncompanies, including our peers, may calculate their non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do. As a result,\nthe non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release may not be directly comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures presented by other companies.\nWe also provide earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA\nand adjusted EBITDA margin as supplemental non-GAAP measures. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income\n(loss) before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based\ncompensation and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance, including net\nincome attributable to noncontrolling interests; business transformation costs; management transition expense; the\ncost of severance, separation and other termination benefits; and the cost of CHIPS Act specialist fees. Our\nmanagement uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to make informed operating decisions,\ncomplete strategic planning, prepare annual budgets, and evaluate Company and management performance. We\nbelieve these non-GAAP financial measures are useful performance measures to our investors because they allow\nfor an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to other companies, including our peers,\nwithout regard to financing methods or capital structures. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss)\nin arriving at adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin because the amounts of these items can vary\nsubstantially within our industry depending on the accounting methods and policies used, book values of assets,\ncapital structures, and the methods by which assets were acquired. These non-GAAP financial measures should not\nbe considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCertain items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and\nassessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the\nhistoric cost bases of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in these non-GAAP financial measures. Our\npresentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our results will be\nunaffected by the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In future fiscal periods, we\nmay exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the\nexclusion of these items and other similar items in these non-GAAP financial measures should not be interpreted as\nimplying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, unless otherwise expressly indicated.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the most directly comparable financial measures, calculated and\npresented in accordance with GAAP, to our non-GAAP financial measures.\n9\nSKYWATER TECHNOLOGY, INC.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nThree-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended\nSeptember 29, June

Proprietary.\nQ3 2024 Results Overview\n• Record revenue of $93.8 million\n◦ ATS development revenue of $56.4 million\n▪ Sequential decline of (9)% from Q2 2024 and increase of 5% compared to Q3 2023\n▪ Impacted by funding limitations at end of government fiscal year\n◦ Wafer Services revenue of $6.7 million\n▪ Stronger than expected demand in Q3 2024, but well below previous quarters due to continued softness\nin industrial segment end-markets\n◦ Record Tools revenue of $30.7 million\n▪ Unprecedented period of customer co-investment\n• Gross Margin of 21.6% on a GAAP basis and 22.3% on a non-GAAP basis\n◦ Favorable to guidance of mid- to high-teens primarily due the successful modification of a customer contract\nthat benefited Q3 2024 with the $5.6 million reversal of the remaining loss accrual initially established at $8.0\nmillion in Q1 2024\n◦ Tools revenue negatively impacted non-GAAP gross margin by 1,050bp; this was offset by 900bp of positive\nimpact from $5.6M loss accrual reversal (after excluding tools impact)\n• Positive earnings and cash flows from operations\n3\n©2024 All Rights Reserved. Proprietary.\nRecent Business Highlights\n• Achieved 9th straight record revenue quarter driven by over $30 million in customer-funded CapEx investments.\nThis unprecedented level of investment by our customers is expected to significantly bolster our capabilities and\ncapacity in both Minnesota and Florida, enabling strong future revenue growth potential in the years to come.\n• Strong gross margin and earnings performance for Q3 exceeded expectations, driven by our continued focus on\noperational efficiencies and improved execution on a significant A&D program, which enabled us to deliver key\nmilestones with lower-than-expected costs and recover the majority of the $8 million cost accrual recorded in\nQ1.\n• Continuing our leadership in critical semiconductor technologies, SkyWater has been selected as a key\nperformer on multiple Microelectronics (ME) Commons projects. These projects are focused on scalable low-\npower microtechnology technologies for AI hardware and other applications. The ME Commons is an important\nelement of the CHIPS Act, supporting emerging technologies for national security.\n• Continued momentum in our commercial ATS business culminated in a new multi-year supply agreement with\nNanoDx, Inc., a pioneer of in vitro diagnostic and biosensing applications.\n• Exciting progress in Florida included the appointment of Bassel Haddad, SVP and GM of our advanced\npackaging business, where he is charged with building and scaling this important new growth vector for\nSkyWater. During the quarter, we continued to place orders for new tooling, funded by the $120 million award\nannounced earlier in the year.\n4\n©2024 All Rights Reserved.

Proprietary.\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\nWe provide supplemental, non-GAAP financial information that our management regularly evaluates to provide additional insight to investors as supplemental\ninformation to our results reported using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We provide non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-\nGAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense, non-GAAP net income (loss) to\nshareholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) to shareholders per basic share and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share. Our management uses these non-\nGAAP financial measures to make informed operating decisions, complete strategic planning, prepare annual budgets, and evaluate Company and management\nperformance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful performance measures to our investors because they provide a baseline for analyzing trends\nin our business and exclude certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings release\nshould not be viewed as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, other companies, including our peers, may calculate their non-GAAP financial measures differently\nthan we do. As a result, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by\nother companies.\nWe also provide earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as supplemental non-\nGAAP measures. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization, equity-based\ncompensation and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance, including net income attributable to noncontrolling interests;\nbusiness transformation costs; management transition expense; the cost of severance, separation and other termination benefits; and the cost of CHIPS Act specialist\nfees. Our management uses EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to make informed operating decisions, complete strategic planning, prepare\nannual budgets, and evaluate Company and management performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful performance measures to our\ninvestors because they allow for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to other companies, including our peers, without regard to\nfinancing methods or capital structures. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin because\nthe amounts of these items can vary substantially within our industry depending on the accounting methods and policies used, book values of assets, capital structures,\nand the methods by which assets were acquired. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the\nreported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures are significant components in understanding and\nassessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost bases of depreciable assets, none of\nwhich are reflected in these non-GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our\nresults will be unaffected by the items excluded from adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur\nincome and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in these non-GAAP financial measures should\nnot be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, unless otherwise expressly indicated.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the most directly comparable financial measures, calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures.\n16\n©2024 All Rights Reserved.
