Additionally, Managed Betting Services grew 18% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong growth in Managed Trading Services from higher trading margins and increased betting activity from existing and new customers.\n\nSports Content, Technology & Services revenues of €45 million, increased 8% year-over-year primarily driven by 10% growth in Marketing & Media Services with strong growth in both European and North America ad:s revenue as several sportsbooks launched marketing campaigns.\n\nThe Company generated strong revenue growth globally with Rest of World up 23% and the United States up 46%. As a percentage of total Company revenues, United States revenue represented 20% of total Company revenue in the third quarter as compared to 17% in the prior year quarter due to market growth, additional customer uptake of our products and premium pricing.\n\nCustomer Net Retention Rate of 126% increased sequentially and from the prior year quarter demonstrating the strength in cross selling and upselling to clients most notably due to the new ATP rights deal and market growth in the United States.\n\n**_Profit for the period from continuing operations_**\n\nProfit for the period from continuing operations in the third quarter was €37 million, up €32 million, compared to €5 million in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by the strong operating results as well as €21 million in net foreign currency gains due to strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar and €15 million of prior year one-time losses related to impairment on goodwill and intangible assets related to the impact of changes related to our business strategy and disposal of an equity-accounted investee. These increases were partially offset by higher financing costs of €14 million driven by the new ATP, NBA, and Bundesliga partnership deals.\n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nThird quarter Adjusted EBITDA was €66 million, up €15 million, compared to €50 million in the same quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by the 27% revenue growth, partially offset by increased sport rights costs primarily related to the ATP partnership deal, higher purchased services driven by investments in developing our product portfolio, increased personnel expenses due to headcount growth and a higher bonus accrual in the current year.\n\n**_Additional Business Highlights_**\n\n  * In conjunction with our partnership with the NBA, Sportradar has launched a suite of next generation products and solutions for the 2024 - 2025 season. Leveraging products such as 4Sight Streaming, emBET, Live Match Tracker and advanced visualizations, Sportradar can harness hundreds of thousands of data points per game to redefine the standards of fan engagement.\n  * Sportradar introduced micro markets for ATP tennis matches in collaboration with Tennis Data Innovations, expanding this cutting-edge product to tennis from other popular sports such as soccer and table tennis. The eight distinct micro markets are expected to generate approximately 1,500 new betting opportunities per match, opening fresh revenue streams for operators.\n  * Sportradar added paid search to its ad:s marketing service, allowing operators to more effectively reach and acquire customers searching betting and gaming-related topics online.\n  * Sportradar received several industry awards, including the Best Live Betting Product at SBC Summit 2024. In addition, Sportradar was recognized in two prestigious categories at the 2024 American Gambling Awards, winning Betting Product of the Year for its 4Sight technology and the Data Service Provider of the Year.\n\n\n\n**_Balance Sheet and Liquidity_**\n\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents were €368 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared with €277 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by net cash generated from operating activities of €271 million due to the strong operating performance, partially offset by net cash used in investing activities of €152 million, primarily from the acquisition of additional sports rights, most notably our new NBA and ATP deals, and from net cash used in financing activities of €26 million, due primarily to share repurchases. Free cash flow for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 was €122 million, an increase of €71 million from the €51 million in the same period a year ago.\n\nIncluding the undrawn credit facility, the Company had total liquidity of €588 million at September 30, 2024 as compared to €510 million as of September 30, 2023, and no debt outstanding.\n\n**_2024 Annual Financial Outlook_**\n\nSportradar is further raising its fiscal 2024 outlook for revenue and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:\n\n  * Revenue of at least €1,090 million, up 24% year-over-year, compared with prior outlook of €1,070 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of at least €216 million, up 29% year-over-year, compared with prior outlook of €204 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 20%.\n\n\n\n**_Share Repurchase Program_**\n\nIn March of this year the Board of Directors approved a $200 million share repurchase program and commenced purchases during the second quarter. During the current quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 721,000 shares for a total of $8.3 million. Year to date through November 1, 2024, the Company has repurchased 1.7 million shares under the plan for a total of approximately $20 million.\n\n**_Conference Call and Webcast Information_**\n\nSportradar will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 results today, November 7, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

See the sections captioned “Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Operating Metric” and “IFRS to Non-IFRS reconciliations” for more details.\n\n**CONTACT:**\n\n**Investor Relations:** Jim Bombassei _j.bombassei@sportradar.com_\n\n**Media:** Sandra Lee _press@sportradar.com_\n\n**_Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Operating Metric_**\n\nWe have provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted purchased services, Adjusted personnel expenses, Adjusted other operating expenses, and Free cash flow, as well as our operating metric, Customer Net Retention Rate. We use these non-IFRS financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to IFRS measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-IFRS financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-IFRS financial measures to investors.\n\nNon-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS financial measures provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.\n\n  * _“Adjusted EBITDA”_ represents earnings for the period from continuing operations adjusted for finance income and finance costs, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of capitalized sport rights licenses), foreign currency gains or losses, and other items that are non-recurring or not related to the Company’s revenue-generating operations, including share-based compensation, impairment charges or income, management restructuring costs, non-routine litigation costs, losses related to equity-accounted investee (SportTech AG), and professional fees for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and enterprise resource planning implementations.License fees relating to sport rights are a key component of how we generate revenue and one of our main operating expenses. Only licenses that meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 are capitalized. The primary distinction for whether a license is capitalized or not capitalized is the contracted length of the applicable license. Therefore, the type of license we enter into can have a significant impact on our results of operations depending on whether we are able to capitalize the relevant license. As such, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA reflects the full costs of our sport right's licenses. Management believes that, by including amortization of sport rights in its calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, the result is a financial metric that is both more meaningful and comparable for management and our investors while also being more indicative of our ongoing operating performance.We present Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that some items excluded are non-recurring in nature and this information is relevant in evaluating the results relative to other entities that operate in the same industry. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors for evaluating Sportradar’s operating performance against competitors, which commonly disclose similar performance measures. However, Sportradar’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled performance measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for any IFRS financial measure.Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA include significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for, profit for the period, revenue or other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as a supplemental measure.\n\n\n  * _“Adjusted EBITDA margin”_ is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to revenue.The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to profit (loss) for the period, its most directly comparable IFRS financial measure, on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort because items that impact this IFRS financial measure are not within the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. These items may include but are not limited to foreign exchange gains and losses. Such information may have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on the Company’s future financial results.\n\n\n\nWe present Adjusted purchased services, Adjusted personnel expenses, and Adjusted other operating expenses (\"Non-IFRS expenses\") because management utilizes these financial measures to manage its business on a day-to-day basis and believes that they are the most relevant measures of expenses. Management believes these adjusted expense measures provide expanded insight to assess revenue and cost performance, in addition to the standard IFRS-based financial measures. Management believes these adjusted expense measures are useful to investors for evaluating Sportradar’s operating performance against competitors. However, Sportradar’s calculation of adjusted expense measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled performance measures of other companies. These adjusted expense measures are not intended to be a substitute for any IFRS financial measure.\n\n  * “ _Adjusted purchased services_ ” represents purchased services less capitalized external development costs.\n  * “ _Adjusted personnel expenses_ ” represents personnel expenses less share-based compensation awarded to employees, management restructuring costs, and capitalized personnel compensation.\n  * “ _Adjusted other operating expenses_ ” represents other operating expenses plus impairment loss on trade receivables, less non-routine litigation, share-based compensation awarded to third parties, and certain professional fees.\n\n\n\nWe consider Free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchase of property and equipment, the purchase of intangible assets and payment of lease liabilities, which can then be used, among other things, to invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions. A limitation of the utility of Free cash flow as a measure of liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the year.\n\n  * “ _Free cash flow_ ” represents net cash from operating activities adjusted for payments for lease liabilities, acquisition of property and equipment, and acquisition of intangible assets.\n\n\n\nIn addition, we define the following operating metric as follows:\n\n  * _“Customer Net Retention Rate”_ is calculated for a given period by starting with the reported Trailing Twelve Month revenue from our top 200 customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or prior period revenue. We then calculate the reported trailing twelve-month revenue from the same customer cohort as of the current period end, or current period revenue. Current period revenue includes any upsells and is net of contraction and attrition over the trailing twelve months but excludes revenue from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total current period revenue by the total prior period revenue to arrive at our Net Retention Rate.\n\n\n\n**_Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nCertain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking” statements and information within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to our current expectations and views of future events, including, without limitation, statements regarding future financial or operating performance, planned activities and objectives, anticipated growth resulting therefrom, market opportunities, strategies and other expectations, and our guidance and outlook, including expected performance for the full year 2024.

Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Previously, these expenses were split between 'Purchased services and licenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)', representing the portion of related sport rights expenses which were not eligible for capitalization and 'Depreciation and amortization', representing the portion of related sport rights expenses which were capitalized. However, starting this quarter, the expenses are combined and presented under a new line item titled 'Sport rights expenses (including amortization of capitalized licenses)'.\n\nThe change in presentation intends to provide more relevant and reliable information to the users of our financial statements. This reclassification aligns the presentation of sport rights expenses with the nature of the costs and the way they are managed internally.\n\nThere is no change to the Company’s disclosures, measurement or recognition of non-capitalized costs and capitalized sport rights licenses in accordance with IAS 38 _Intangible Assets_ reported in its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended
