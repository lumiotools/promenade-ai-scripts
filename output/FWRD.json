Our new breath of end-to-end services has also led to several collective wins since closing the acquisition. \n\n“Beyond the near-term synergy and sales wins, we are beginning to transform for longer-term success; a company that shares a common fabric and a common customer-first DNA. Going forward we will be working to collaborate across legacy entities, eliminate previously unidentified redundancies, automate and digitize repetitive processes and unifying under a new brand with a common goal and mission. Transforming a company of this size, complexity and geographic diversity is not an event and will take time, but I am confident in our strategy. \n\n“Part of that strategy is strengthening our team with industry leading talent. To that end, I am excited to announce that we have hired a new Chief Commercial Officer who is slated to join us in January. He has over 20 years of experience in global logistics and is well prepared to collaborate with our customers. I am excited about his industry expertise and ability to hit the ground running in the first quarter of next year. \n\n“Looking ahead, it is difficult to forecast the next freight cycle, but we remain focused on actively integrating and transforming the Company so we can be prepared to capitalize on the market upturn as a comprehensive vertical global logistics company with ground, air, ocean, contract logistics and customers brokerage services,” concluded Stewart. \n\nJamie Pierson, Chief Financial Officer added, “For the third quarter of 2024, we reported revenue of $656 million and operating income of $23 million. On a segment basis, Omni Logistics continued to improve and sequentially grew revenue and operating income. However, the Expedited Freight segment did not perform up to our expectations due largely to a decrease in year-over-year revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, which was primarily attributable to customer mix and the associated pricing. Revenue at the Intermodal segment was down but tight cost management strategies kept operating income essentially flat year-over-year. \n\n“For the third quarter, Consolidated EBITDA (\"Consolidated EBITDA\"), a non-GAAP measure calculated pursuant to our Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), was $77 million compared to $81 million last quarter showing resilience and stability in the face of a challenging macro environment. For the twelve months ending September 30, 2024, Consolidated EBITDA was $307 million which resulted in an approximate $32 million cushion under the Credit Agreement’s consolidated first lien net leverage ratio covenant. \n\n“On the heels of robust operating cash flow, we ended the third quarter in a stronger liquidity position as cash increased $33 million from the previous quarter and liquidity increased $15 million to $460 million. With the third quarter behind us, we expect 2024 Consolidated EBITDA guidance to $300 to $310 million, which reflects our expectation of continued softness in the overall macro environment.” noted Pierson. \n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**(in thousands, except per share data)** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **Change** |  **Percent Change**  \nOperating revenue  |  $  |  655,937  |  $  |  340,976  |  $  |  314,961  |  92.4  |  %   \n(Loss) income from operations  |  $  |  22,697  |  $  |  11,689  |  $  |  11,008  |  94.2  |  %   \nOperating margin  |  3.5  |  %  |  3.4  |  %  |  10 bps   \nNet (loss) income  |  $  |  (34,198  |  )  |  $  |  6,493  |  $  |  (40,691  |  )  |  (626.7  |  )%   \nNet (loss) income per diluted share  |  $  |  (2.62  |  )  |  $  |  0.25  |  $  |  (2.87  |  )  |  (1,148.0  |  )%   \nCash (used in) provided by operating activities  |  $  |  52,597  |  $  |  24,666  |  $  |  27,931  |  113.2  |  %   \n_Non-GAAP Financial Measures: 1_  \nConsolidated EBITDA  |  $  |  76,997  |  $  |  92,714  |  $  |  (15,717  |  )  |  (17.0  |  )%   \nFree cash flow  |  $  |  43,270  |  $  |  19,526  |  $  |  23,744  |  121.6  |  %   \n1 Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are provided below the financial tables.   \n  \n**Review of Financial Results**\n\nForward Air will hold a conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results on Monday, November 4, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. ET.

Measures**\n\nIn this press release, the Company includes financial measures that are derived on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The Company believes that meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance, including an understanding of items that are non-operational. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions as well as evaluating the Company’s performance. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, this press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), and free cash flow. \n\nAll non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis. \n\nThe Company believes that EBITDA improves comparability from period to period by removing the impact of its capital structure (interest and financing expenses), asset base (depreciation and amortization) and tax impacts. The Company believes that free cash flow is an important measure of its ability to repay maturing debt or fund other uses of capital that it believes will enhance shareholder value. \n\nThe Company is also providing Consolidated EBITDA calculated in accordance with our credit agreement as we believe it provides investors with important information regarding our financial condition and compliance with our obligations under our credit agreement. \n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to or substitute for, the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company has included, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures set forth below. \n\nWith respect to the 2024 Consolidated EBITDA guidance, please note that the Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to Net Income because it is not available without unreasonable efforts. The Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such reconciliation, or to quantify the probable significance of these items. The adjustments required for any such reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures cannot be accurately forecast by the Company, and therefore the reconciliation has been omitted. \n\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Consolidated EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): \n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Income (loss) from continuing operations** |  $ (34,198)  |  $ 6,493  |  $ (1,089,463)  |  $ 57,524   \nInterest expense  |  52,770  |  2,655  |  140,788  |  7,595   \nIncome tax (benefit) expense  |  1,302  |  2,541  |  (191,990)  |  20,091   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  25,893  |  14,209  |  106,321  |  39,826   \n**Reported EBITDA** |  45,767  |  25,898  |  (1,034,344)  |  125,036   \nImpairment of goodwill  |  14,751  |  —  |  1,107,465  |  —   \nTransaction and integration costs  |  (549)  |  22,371  |  71,393  |  27,871   \nSeverance costs  |  2,829  |  158  |  14,414  |  319   \nCost synergies  |  7,267  |  —  |  23,518  |  —   \nRIF cost savings  |  —  |  5,509  |  10,576  |  15,875   \nOther  |  6,932  |  1,485  |  19,858  |  2,328   \nPro forma -Omni adjusted EBITDA  |  —  |  37,293  |  —  |  128,574   \n**Consolidated EBITDA** |  $ 76,997  |  $ 92,714  |  $ 212,880  |  $ 300,003   \n  \nThe following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): \n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023** |  **September 30, 2024** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations** |  $ 52,597  |  $ 24,666  |  $ (44,327)  |  $ 142,120   \nProceeds from sale of property and equipment  |  1,087  |  104  |  2,493  |  3,275   \nPurchases of property and equipment  |  (10,414)  |  (5,244)  |  (29,810)  |  (22,080)   \n**Free cash flow** |  $ 43,270  |  $ 19,526  |  $ (71,644)  |  $ 123,315   \n  \n**Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\n_This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Forward-looking statements included in this press release relate to expectations regarding the Company’s long-term growth; ability to achieve and accelerate synergy capture and eliminate costs from our structure; expectations regarding the Company’s expedited freight business; ability to achieve the intended benefits of the acquisition of Omni Logistics, including any revenue and cost synergies; the Company’s expectations regarding the Company’s financial performance, including Consolidated EBITDA, and the impact it may have on the business and results of operations; and expectations regarding the Company's revenue growth strategies, including with respect to operational efficiency and cost control._\n\n_Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions.

Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not unduly rely on any of these forward-looking statements. The following is a list of factors, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: economic factors such as recessions, inflation, higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles, the Company's ability to achieve the expected strategic, financial and other benefits of the acquisition of Omni Logistics, including the realization of expected synergies and the achievement of deleveraging targets within the expected timeframes or at all, the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully or that integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected, the risk that operating costs, customer loss, management and employee retention and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining relationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers) as a result of the acquisition of Omni Logistics may be greater than expected, continued weakening of the freight environment, future debt and financing levels, our ability to deleverage, including, without limitation, through capital allocation or divestitures of non-core businesses, our ability to secure terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates, more limited liquidity than expected which limits our ability to make key investments, the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services rendered, our inability to maintain our historical growth rate because of a decreased volume of freight or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network, the availability and compensation of qualified Leased Capacity Providers and freight handlers as well as contracted, third-party carriers needed to serve our customers’ transportation needs, our inability to manage our information systems and inability of our information systems to handle an increased volume of freight moving through our network, the occurrence of cybersecurity risks and events, market acceptance of our service offerings, claims for property damage, personal injuries or workers’ compensation, enforcement of and changes in governmental regulations, environmental, tax, insurance and accounting matters, the handling of hazardous materials, changes in fuel prices, loss of a major customer, increasing competition, and pricing pressure, our dependence on our senior management team and the potential effects of changes in employee status, seasonal trends, the occurrence of certain weather events, restrictions in our charter and bylaws and the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and as may be identified in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K._\n\n_We caution readers that any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and they should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's opinion as of the date on which it is made.

Our new breath of end-to-end services has also led to several collective wins since\nclosing the acquisition.\n“Beyond the near-term synergy and sales wins, we are beginning to transform for longer-\nterm success; a company that shares a common fabric and a common customer-first DNA.\nGoing forward we will be working to collaborate across legacy entities, eliminate previously\nunidentified redundancies, automate and digitize repetitive processes and unifying under a\nnew brand with a common goal and mission. Transforming a company of this size,\ncomplexity and geographic diversity is not an event and will take time, but I am confident in\nour strategy.\n“Part of that strategy is strengthening our team with industry leading talent. To that end, I am\nexcited to announce that we have hired a new Chief Commercial Officer who is slated to join\nus in January. He has over 20 years of experience in global logistics and is well prepared to\ncollaborate with our customers. I am excited about his industry expertise and ability to hit the\nground running in the first quarter of next year.\n“Looking ahead, it is difficult to forecast the next freight cycle, but we remain focused on\nactively integrating and transforming the Company so we can be prepared to capitalize on\nthe market upturn as a comprehensive vertical global logistics company with ground, air,\nocean, contract logistics and customers brokerage services,” concluded Stewart.\nJamie Pierson, Chief Financial Officer added, “For the third quarter of 2024, we reported\nrevenue of $656 million and operating income of $23 million. On a segment basis, Omni\nLogistics continued to improve and sequentially grew revenue and operating income.\nHowever, the Expedited Freight segment did not perform up to our expectations due largely\nto a decrease in year-over-year revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, which\nwas primarily attributable to customer mix and the associated pricing. Revenue at the\nIntermodal segment was down but tight cost management strategies kept operating income\nessentially flat year-over-year.\n“For the third quarter, Consolidated EBITDA (\"Consolidated EBITDA\"), a non-GAAP\nmeasure calculated pursuant to our Senior Secured Term Loan Credit Agreement (the\n\"Credit Agreement\"), was $77 million compared to $81 million last quarter showing resilience\nand stability in the face of a challenging macro environment. For the twelve months ending\nSeptember 30, 2024, Consolidated EBITDA was $307 million which resulted in an\napproximate $32 million cushion under the Credit Agreement’s consolidated first lien net\nleverage ratio covenant.\n“On the heels of robust operating cash flow, we ended the third quarter in a stronger liquidity\nposition as cash increased $33 million from the previous quarter and liquidity increased $15\nmillion to $460 million. With the third quarter behind us, we expect 2024 Consolidated\nEBITDA guidance to $300 to $310 million, which reflects our expectation of continued\nsoftness in the overall macro environment.” noted Pierson.\nThree Months Ended\n(in thousands, except per share data) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Percent Change\nOperating revenue $ 655,937 $ 340,976 $314,961 92.4%\n(Loss) income from operations $ 22,697 $ 11,689 $ 11,008 94.2%\nOperating margin 3.5% 3.4% 10 bps\nNet (loss) income $ (34,198) $ 6,493 $(40,691) (626.7)%\nNet (loss) income per diluted share $ (2.62) $ 0.25 $ (2.87) (1,148.0)%\nCash (used in) provided by operating\nactivities $ 52,597 $ 24,666 $ 27,931 113.2%\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: 1\nConsolidated EBITDA $ 76,997 $ 92,714 $(15,717) (17.0)%\nFree cash flow $ 43,270 $ 19,526 $ 23,744 121.6%\n1 Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures are provided below the financial tables.\nReview of Financial Results\nForward Air will hold a conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results on Monday,\nNovember 4, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. ET.

other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States (GAAP). The Company believes that meaningful analysis of its financial\nperformance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance, including\nan understanding of items that are non-operational. Management uses these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions as\nwell as evaluating the Company’s performance.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, this press release contains the\nfollowing non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization (“EBITDA”), and free cash flow.\nAll non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis.\nThe Company believes that EBITDA improves comparability from period to period by\nremoving the impact of its capital structure (interest and financing expenses), asset base\n(depreciation and amortization) and tax impacts. The Company believes that free cash flow\nis an important measure of its ability to repay maturing debt or fund other uses of capital that\nit believes will enhance shareholder value.\nThe Company is also providing Consolidated EBITDA calculated in accordance with our\ncredit agreement as we believe it provides investors with important information regarding our\nfinancial condition and compliance with our obligations under our credit agreement.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to\nor substitute for, the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The\nCompany has included, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors and other\nreaders are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the\nreconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP\nmeasures set forth below.\nWith respect to the 2024 Consolidated EBITDA guidance, please note that the Company is\nnot providing a quantitative reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to Net Income because it\nis not available without unreasonable efforts. The Company does not currently have\nsufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments for such\nreconciliation, or to quantify the probable significance of these items. The adjustments\nrequired for any such reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking non-GAAP financial\nmeasures cannot be accurately forecast by the Company, and therefore the reconciliation\nhas been omitted.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income to Consolidated EBITDA for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations $ (34,198) $ 6,493 $ (1,089,463) $ 57,524\nInterest expense 52,770 2,655 140,788 7,595\nIncome tax (benefit) expense 1,302 2,541 (191,990) 20,091\nDepreciation and amortization 25,893 14,209 106,321 39,826\nReported EBITDA 45,767 25,898 (1,034,344) 125,036\nImpairment of goodwill 14,751 — 1,107,465 —\nTransaction and integration costs (549) 22,371 71,393 27,871\nSeverance costs 2,829 158 14,414 319\nCost synergies 7,267 — 23,518 —\nRIF cost savings — 5,509 10,576 15,875\nOther 6,932 1,485 19,858 2,328\nPro forma -Omni adjusted EBITDA — 37,293 — 128,574\n$ 76,997 $ 92,714 $ 212,880 $ 300,003\nConsolidated EBITDA\nThe following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities of\ncontinuing operations $ 52,597 $ 24,666 $ (44,327) $ 142,120\nProceeds from sale of property and equipment 1,087 104 2,493 3,275\nPurchases of property and equipment (10,414) (5,244) (29,810) (22,080)\n$ 43,270 $ 19,526 $ (71,644) $ 123,315\nFree cash flow\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe\nharbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These statements may reflect Forward Air Corporation’s (“Forward”)\nexpectations, beliefs, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding, among other things, the potential transaction (the “Proposed Acquisition”) between Forward and Omni Logistics, LLC\n(“Omni”), the expected timetable for completing the Proposed Acquisition (including the timing for realizing any such synergies and the conversion of revenue synergies to adjusted\nEBITDA), the benefits and expected cost and revenue synergies of the Proposed Acquisition and future opportunities for the combined company, as well as other statements that are other\nthan historical fact, including, without limitation, statements concerning future financial performance, future debt and financing levels (including the achievement of targeted deleveraging\nwithin the expected time frames or at all), investment objectives, implications of litigation and regulatory investigations and other management plans for future operations and performance.\nWords such as “anticipate(s),” “expect(s)”, “intend(s)”, “plan(s)”, “target(s)”, “project(s)”, “believe(s)”, “will”, “aim”, “would”, “seek(s)”, “estimate(s)” and similar expressions are intended\nto identify such forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, projections, estimates, assumptions and beliefs and are subject to a number ofknown and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and other factors that could lead to actual results materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements. Forward can give no assurance that its\nexpectations will be attained. Forward’s actual results, liquidity and financial condition may differ from the anticipated results, liquidity and financial condition indicated in these forward-\nlooking statements. We caution readers that any such statements are based on currently available operational, financial and competitive information, and they should not place undue\nreliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s opinion only as of the date on which they were made. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of\nfuture performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and there are certain important factors that could cause Forward’s actual results to differ, possibly materially, from expectations or\nestimates reflected in such forward-looking statements, including, but without limitation:\n• the parties’ ability to consummate the Proposed Acquisition and to meet expectations regarding the timing and completion thereof;\n• the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Proposed Acquisition, including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals or clearances in a timely manner and\non terms acceptable to Forward;\n• the risk that the parties may be unable to achieve the expected strategic, financial and other benefits of the Proposed Acquisition, including the realization of expected synergies and the\nachievement of deleveraging targets, within the expected time-frames or at all;\n• the risk that the committed financing necessary for the consummation of the Proposed Acquisition is unavailable at the closing, and that any replacement financing may not be available\non similar terms, or at all;\n• the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully or that integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected;\n• the risk that operating costs, customer loss and business disruption (including, without limitation, difficulties in maintainingrelationships with employees, customers, clients or suppliers)\nmay be greater than expected following the Proposed Acquisition;\n• the risk that, if Forward does not obtain the necessary shareholder approval for the conversion of the perpetual non-voting convertible preferred stock to be issued by Forward in the\nProposed Acquisition, Forward will be required to pay an annual dividend on such preferred stock;\n2\nForward-Looking Statements (Cont’d)\n• the risks associated with being a holding company with the only material assets after completion of the Proposed Acquisition being the interest in the combined business and,\naccordingly, dependency upon distributions from the combined business to pay taxes and other expenses;\n• the requirement for Forward to pay certain tax benefits that it may claim in the future, and the expected materiality of these amounts;\n• risks associated with organizational structure, including payment obligations under the tax receivable agreement, which may be significant, and any accelerations or significant increases\nthereto;\n• the inability to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are currently expected to result from the acquisition of certain corporate owners of Omni, certain pre-existing tax attributes\nof Omni shareholders and tax attributes that may arise on the distribution of cash to other Omni shareholders in connection withthe Proposed Acquisition, as well as the future\nexchanges of units of Forward’s operating subsidiary and payments made under the tax receivables agreement;\n• increases in interest rates;\n• changes in Forward’s credit ratings and outlook;\n• risks relating to the indebtedness Forward expects to incur in connection with the Proposed Acquisition and the need to generatesufficient cash flows to service and repay such debt;\n• the ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to service the indebtedness;\n• the limitations and restrictions in surviving agreements governing indebtedness;\n• risks associated with the need to obtain additional financing which may not be available or, if it is available, may result in areduction in the ownership of current Forward shareholders;\n• and general economic and market conditions.\nThese and other risks and uncertainties are more fully discussed in the risk factors identified in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” inPart I of Forward’s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-\nK, and as may be identified in Forward’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
