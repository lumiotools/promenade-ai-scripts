(Headquarters: Tokyo, Japan; CEO: Itaru Tanimura; URL: https://corporate.m3.com/en/;\n“M3” below) has announced the acquisition via M3’s European subsidiary VIDAL Group (“Vidal” below),\nof Agence C.C.C. (officially registered as SAS C.C.C.; Headquarters: Paris, France; URL:\nhttps://www.agenceccc.fr/; “Agence C.C.C.” below), a prominent medical events and communications\nagency that organizes training and informational events for general practitioners throughout France.\n Background and Overview of the Acquisition\nM3 operates m3.com, a specialized web portal for medical professionals that delivers healthcare-\nrelated information to its 330,000+ physician members in Japan. Presence outside of Japan includes\nthe U.S., U.K., France, China, Korea, and India, with aggressive business expansion overseas that\nhas amassed 6.5 million physicians across its global platforms.\nIn France, M3 acquired Vidal in 2016, which provides prescription management software\nsolutions. The drug database managed by Vidal is used by 75% of the physicians in France. In 2019,\nthrough Vidal, M3 also completed the acquisition of Weda, now a market leader for cloud-based\npractice management software for the ambulatory care market. Over 20,000 healthcare professionals,\nincluding 13,000 physicians, use Weda on a daily basis.\nAgence C.C.C. is positioned as a multi-channel events and communications agency. It is unique\nin that it integrates all the skills required for the organization of medical events: a scientific advisory\nteam, a logistics organization department, a registration management department and a specialized\ncomputer graphics department. In particular, it organizes the Preuves & Pratiques medical congress\nseries, which each year brings together over 6,500 general practitioners and residency general\npractitioners to discuss patient care matters, thanks to its presence in 26 French cities. In addition, the\nagency organizes medical conferences on specialized topics and publishes medical journals and\ndigital newsletters. Known for its evidence-based educational and training events, Agence C.C.C. is\nhighly regarded among general practitioners. With over 20 years of experience, the company has\nfirmly established itself as a trusted service provider for pharmaceutical companies and medical\nassociations.\n Expected Synergies\nWith this acquisition, the M3 Group is set to expand into the comprehensive medical events and\npublishing sectors in France. Agence C.C.C. is expected to benefit from enhanced value through\nincreased event participation and publication reach via the Vidal platform, along with expanded\ndistribution opportunities through the digitization of event content. For Vidal, the acquisition presents\nopportunities for service expansion by leveraging Agence C.C.C.'s expertise and attracting new\nphysician members. As a leading provider of solutions in the medical field, the M3 Group is committed\nto addressing medical challenges and pursuing further growth.\nOverview of Agence C.C.C.\nCompany name: SAS C.C.C.

This is attributable to a decline in the pharmaceutical marketing support business as a result\nof budget cuts by pharmaceutical companies and a decline in sales from COVID-related projects, despite strong\nmomentum in businesses such as digitalization support for medical practices.\n2) Evidence Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 11,940 million yen, down 13.7% year on year, with segment profit of 1,893 million yen,\ndown 47.1% year on year. This is because COVID-related clinical trial projects made lower contributions to revenue\ncompared to the previous fiscal year, as well as slow momentum in the overall order trends.\n3) Career Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 11,617 million yen, up 28.6% year on year, with segment profit of 4,099 million yen,\nup 22.8% year on year. This is attributable to a robust revenue growth in job search and placement support services for\nboth physicians and pharmacists.\n4) Site Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 21,611 million yen, up 40.8% year on year, with segment profit of 3,047 million yen,\nup 71.6% year on year. This is mainly attributable to the incremental contribution of the podiatry clinic operation\nbusiness in the U.S. acquired in January 2024, in addition to an increase in the occupancy rate of facilities opened in\nthe previous fiscal year or before in the hospice business.\n5) Overseas\nSegment revenue amounted to 37,984 million yen, up 16.3% year on year. This is attributable to solid performance\nmainly in Europe and APAC regions as well as the impact of the acquisitions completed in the previous fiscal year.\nSegment profit amounted to 6,636 million yen, down 9.1% year on year. This was because higher segment revenue\n- 4 -\nwas more than offset by negative factors including continued lower topline in the U.S. clinical trial business, which\nrequires a certain level of fixed costs to operate.\n6) Other Emerging Businesses\nSegment revenue amounted to 1,123 million yen, down 6.5% year on year, and segment profit was 370 million yen,\nwith segment profit of 16 million yen in the same period of the previous fiscal year. The surge of segment profit was\ndriven by investment in equity-method affiliates.\nCombining all of the above, revenue of the M3 Group for the first half ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 124,819\nmillion yen, up 7.8% year on year, with operating profit of 28,982 million yen, down 16.1% year on year, profit before\ntax of 29,074 million yen, down 22.1% year on year, and profit of 19,589 million yen, down 22.1% year on year.\nDisclaimer: This document is a translation of the original Japanese version.

This is attributable to a decline in the pharmaceutical marketing support business as a result\nof budget cuts by pharmaceutical companies, despite strong momentum in businesses such as digitalization support\nfor medical practices.\n2) Evidence Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 6,108 million yen, down 12.3% year on year, with segment profit of 1,013 million yen,\ndown 46.3% year on year. This is because COVID-related clinical trial projects made lower contributions to revenue\ncompared to the previous fiscal year, as well as slow momentum in the overall order trends.\n3) Career Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 7,212 million yen, up 29.1% year on year, with segment profit of 3,314 million yen, up\n24.4% year on year. This is attributable to a robust revenue growth in job search and placement support services for\nboth physicians and pharmacists, as well as new demand for physician services due to the April 2024 overtime-work\nregulations.\n4) Site Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 10,597 million yen, up 38.3% year on year, with segment profit of 1,342 million yen,\nup 61.5% year on year. This is mainly attributable to the incremental contribution of the podiatry clinic operation\nbusiness in the U.S. acquired in January 2024, in addition to an increase in the occupancy rate of facilities opened in\nthe previous fiscal year or before in the hospice business.\n5) Overseas\nSegment revenue amounted to 19,879 million yen, up 26.5% year on year. This is attributable to solid performance\nmainly in Europe and APAC regions as well as the impact of the acquisitions completed in the previous fiscal year.\n- 4 -\nSegment profit amounted to 3,719 million yen, up 1.1% year on year. This was due to higher segment revenue, partially\noffset by continued lower topline in the U.S. clinical trial business, which requires a certain level of fixed costs to\noperate.\n6) Other Emerging Businesses\nSegment revenue amounted to 538 million yen, down 2.5% year on year, and segment profit was 143 million yen, with\nsegment loss of 126 million yen in the first quarter of the previous fiscal year.\nCombining all of the above, revenue of the M3 Group for the three months ended June 30, 2024 amounted to 64,209\nmillion yen, up 11.9% year on year, with operating profit of 16,899 million yen, down 6.1% year on year, profit before\ntax of 18,784 million yen, down 5.3% year on year, and profit of 12,750 million yen, down 5.9% year on year.\n- 5 -"

This is attributable to strong businesses such\nas digitalization support for medical practices, partially offset by a decline in the pharmaceutical marketing support\nbusiness as a result of budget cuts by pharmaceutical companies. Segment profit was 38,626 million yen, down 6.1%\nyear on year. This was due to a lower sales contribution year on year from the pharmaceutical marketing support\nbusiness, which has higher operating margin than other businesses in the segment.\n2) Evidence Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 26,700 million yen, down 1.7% year on year, with segment profit of 6,698 million yen,\ndown 12.6% year on year. This is because COVID-related clinical trial projects, etc. made lower contributions to\nrevenue compared to the previous fiscal year, although ordinary businesses such as CRO remained solid.\n3) Career Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 16,642 million yen, up 14.5% year on year, with segment profit of 4,781 million yen,\nup 2.9% year on year. This is attributable to a recovery trend in revenue from job search and placement support services\nfor pharmacists that had been affected by the pandemic, despite the impact of lower contributions from COVID\nvaccination support projects compared to the previous fiscal year.\n4) Site Solution\nSegment revenue amounted to 33,025 million yen, down 6.4% year on year, with segment profit of 3,735 million yen,\ndown 0.3% year on year. This is mainly attributable to the impact of lower contributions from COVID vaccination\nsupport projects and clinical trial projects compared to the previous fiscal year, despite robust ordinary businesses.\n5) Overseas\nSegment revenue amounted to 69,868 million yen, up 12.5% year on year. This is attributable to solid performance\nmainly in Europe and APAC regions. Despite the increase in revenue, segment profit amounted to 11,695 million yen,\n- 4 -\ndown 31.2% year on year. This is attributable to lower contributions from COVID-related clinical trial projects, which\nare mainly conducted in North America region, compared to the previous fiscal year, as well as the recognition of an\nimpairment loss in the clinical trial business in this region.\n6) Other Emerging Businesses\nSegment revenue amounted to 2,633 million yen, down 19.8% year on year, and segment loss was 290 million yen,\nwith profit of 945 million yen in the previous fiscal year. This segment loss is attributable to an impairment loss for\nM3 Education, Inc., which provides medical and welfare professional education such as preparation services for\nnational examinations, due to a shrinking market for its business related to preparing students for the National Dental\nPractitioner’s examination.\nCombining all of the above, revenue of the M3 Group for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2024 amounted to 238,883\nmillion yen, up 3.5% year on year, with operating profit of 64,381 million yen, down 10.6% year on year, profit before\ntax of 68,840 million yen, down 7.4% year on year, and profit of 48,549 million yen, down 6.6% year on year.\n(2) Summary of Consolidated Status of Financial Position\nTotal assets amounted to 490,780 million yen, up by 90,135 million yen from the end of the previous fiscal year.\nCurrent assets amounted to 240,739 million yen, up by 37,269 million yen, mainly due to a 31,343 million yen increase\nin cash and cash equivalents. Non-current assets amounted to 250,041 million yen, up by 52,866 million yen, mainly\ndue to a 24,168 million yen increase in goodwill and a 10,862 million yen increase in intangible assets resulting from\nan impact from favorable foreign exchange and the acquisition of new consolidated subsidiaries.\nTotal liabilities amounted to 124,079 million yen, up by 32,952 million yen from the end of the previous fiscal year.\nCurrent liabilities increased 7,589 million yen to 67,169 million yen, mainly due to a 6,013 million yen increase in\ntrade and other payables. Non-current liabilities increased 25,363 million yen to 56,910 million yen, mainly due to a\n16,388 million yen increase in borrowings.\nTotal shareholders' equity amounted to 366,701 million yen, up by 57,183 million yen from the end of the previous\nfiscal year. This was mainly due to an increase of 32,356 million yen in retained earnings, reflecting the recording of\n45,271 million yen in profit attributable to owners of the parent, partially offset by a payout of 12,899 million yen as\ndividends from surplus, and other components of equity increased by 15,269 million yen due to the recording of 15,220\nmillion yen of other comprehensive income attributable to owners of the parent company.\n(3) Summary of Cash Flows for the Current Fiscal Year\nThe balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the current fiscal year was 149,661 million yen, with an increase\nof 31,343 million yen from the end of the previous fiscal year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities amounted to 58,310 million yen (57,113 million yen in the previous fiscal\nyear). The main cash inflow was profit before tax of 68,840 million yen, and the main cash outflow was income taxes\npaid of 22,947 million yen.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled 39,456 million yen (21,933 million yen in the previous fiscal year). The\noutflow mainly consisted of 27,346 million yen for the purchase of shares of subsidiaries resulting in change in scope\nof consolidation.\nNet cash provided by financing activities amounted to 9,432 million yen (22,837 million yen used in the previous fiscal\nyear). The main cash inflows were proceeds from borrowings of 19,920 million yen and proceeds from payments by\nnon-controlling interests of 13,109 million yen, while the main cash outflow was 12,896 million yen in cash dividends\npaid to the owners of the parent.\n- 5 -\n(4) Outlook\nConsolidated revenue and operating profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 are expected to increase.\n1) Medical Platform\nIn the pharmaceutical marketing support business, although revenue related to the COVID-19 have fallen off and there\nis still a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of improvement in budget trends among pharmaceutical\ncompanies, overall segment revenue and profit are expected to increase due to continued growth in the digitalization\nsupport for medical practices and other areas.\n2) Evidence Solutions\nSegment revenue is expected to remain flat and profit is expected to decline, as the contribution from clinical trial\nprojects related to the COVID-19 is expected to be even smaller than in the fiscal year ended March 2024.\n3) Carrier Solutions\nIn addition to the growth in regular businesses, an increase in revenue related to the regulation of working hours for\nhealthcare professionals are expected, resulting in higher segment revenue and profit than the fiscal year ended March\n2024.\n4) Site Solutions\nAn increase in segment revenue and profit is expected as growth in regular businesses accelerates.\n5) Overseas Business\nAn increase in segment revenue and profit is expected through steady expansion of each service in each region.\nBased on the above, the consolidated earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 is as follows.\nFinancial Results Forecasts for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31,2025\nProfit attributable to\nRevenue Operating profit Profit before tax Profit\nowners of the parent\nMillions of yen % Millions of yen % Millions of yen % Millions of yen % Millions of yen %\nSix Months\nEnding\n127,000 9.7 28,000 (19.0) 28,500 (23.6) 19,500 (22.4) 17,500 (25.2)\nSeptember\n30, 2024\nFiscal Year\n268,000 12.2 67,000 4.1 68,000 (1.2) 47,000 (3.2) 44,000 (2.8)\nEnding\n～ ～ ～ ～ ～ ～ ～ ～ ～ ～\nMarch 31,\n273,000 14.3 70,000 8.7 71,000 3.1 49,000 0.9 46,000 1.6\n2025\n2.
