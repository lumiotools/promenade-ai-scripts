(NASDAQ:TTOO) (the “Company”), a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, today announced financial and operational results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Recent Financial and Commercial Highlights**\n\n  * Achieved third quarter total revenue of $2.0 million, representing an increase of 34% compared to the prior year period.\n  * Achieved sepsis test panel revenue of $1.4 million, representing an increase of 34% compared to the prior year period, driven by increased U.S. T2Bacteria® Panel revenue.\n  * Executed contracts for 11 T2Dx® Instruments during the third quarter, including 1 in the U.S. and 10 internationally.\n  * Initiated exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with Cardinal Health for the commercialization of the T2Biosystems Sepsis product portfolio, expanding access to the U.S. hospital market\n  * Launched co-marketing collaboration with Prxcision, Inc., for rapid direct-from-blood diagnostics and AI-powered decision support platform to provide hospitals with a solution that is designed to deliver rapid identification of pathogens directly from blood in hours, not days, paired with real-time insights and information to help guide the best possible treatment decisions\n\n\n\n**Recent Pipeline and Clinical Highlights**\n\n  * Received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market the T2Candida® Panel for pediatric patients.\n  * Advanced the T2Resistance® Panel toward U.S. FDA 510(k) submission which is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2025.\n  * Defended successfully against an opposition of a key patent for the Company’s innovative direct-from-blood pathogen detection method filed with the European Patent Office by bioMerieux.\n  * The article “Changing the Culture of Blood Culture” recently published in The Lancet, a world-leading medical journal, highlighted the weaknesses of blood culture, and the more ideal characteristics of culture-independent diagnostics consistent with the features and benefits provided by the T2Bacteria Panel, the T2Candida Panel, and the T2Resistance Panel.\n\n\n\n“In the third quarter T2Biosystems generated strong revenue growth driven by 173% sales growth from the T2Bacteria Panel in the U.S. and 78% growth in international instrument sales,” stated John Sperzel, Chairman and CEO of T2 Biosystems. “We expect to continue achieving stronger growth following several recent commercial, operational and pipeline advancements. The U.S. commercial distribution agreement with Cardinal, collaboration with Prxcision, and FDA clearance for the T2Candida Panel for pediatrics represent immediate opportunities to provide our clinically differentiated, culture-independent, diagnostics to more patients and hospitals.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.0 million, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year period. Sepsis test revenue grew 34% compared to the prior year period, led by T2Bacteria®.\n\nCost of product revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.1 million, a 4% increase compared to the prior year period driven by increased international instrument and sepsis test sales. Research and development expenses were $2.7 million, which is comparable to the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $5.4 million, a 10% decrease compared to the prior year period driven by decreased headcount, offset by increased legal expense.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.1 million, $(0.57) per share, compared to the prior year third quarter net loss of $15.4 million, or $(3.45) per share.\n\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $2.1 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company raised $4.3 million in net proceeds with our ATM during the quarter and $3.2 million since September 30, 2024.\n\n**2024 Financial Outlook** The Company expects fourth quarter 2024 total sepsis product revenue of $2.5 million to $3.5 million. This target does not include potential sales of the T2Biothreat™ Panel or the T2Lyme™ Panel.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** The Company’s management team will host a conference call today, November 14, 2024, beginning at 4:30 pm ET.

Announce Co-Marketing Collaboration for Rapid Direct-From-Blood Diagnostics and AI-Powered Decision Support Platform\n\n**Pioneering a new frontier in antibiotic stewardship to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance**\n\nLEXINGTON, Mass. and SCHENECTADY, N.Y., Oct. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- T2 Biosystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTOO), a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, and Prxcision, Inc., innovators behind the real-time AI-powered decision support platform pRxcision®, have announced a co-marketing collaboration intended to deliver a revolutionary solution for patients suspected of bloodstream infections and sepsis, and combat the escalating crisis of antibiotic resistance.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats facing modern medicine, with millions of lives at risk. Over 1.27 million deaths are reported annually due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which threatens to render essential antibiotics useless. The stakes are high, and time is critical—each hour of delayed targeted treatment can increase the risk of death by up to 8% for sepsis patients. By co-marketing T2 Biosystems’ rapid, direct-from-blood diagnostics and the pRxcision® platform, the companies intend to enable a new, comprehensive approach to infection management. This collaboration is expected to provide hospitals with a powerful solution: rapid identification of pathogens directly from blood in hours, not days, paired with real-time insights and information to guide the best possible treatment decisions—immediately.\n\n**A Revolution in Real-Time Care** “Imagine being able to detect sepsis-causing pathogens within a few hours and having the information needed to act in real time,” said John Sperzel, CEO of T2 Biosystems. “We believe our collaboration with Prxcision, Inc. brings this vision to life. By combining our direct-from-blood diagnostics with the AI-driven pRxcision® platform, we plan to empower clinicians with the information to stop infections in their tracks—faster than ever before. We believe this collaboration will not only prevent antibiotic misuse but also reduce resistance, save lives, and fundamentally change the way we manage sepsis.”\n\n**The Right Treatment at the Right Time** The pRxcision® platform is designed to leverage data from T2 Biosystems’ diagnostics to provide another level of precision—using advanced pharmacokinetic models, pathogen profiles, and real-time patient data to enable clinicians to prescribe the right drug, dose, and duration as the patient's condition evolves. The platform adapts continuously to changing clinical information, providing ranked, evidence-based treatment regimens that help clinicians optimize care and improve outcomes.\n\n“Our platform delivers real-time insights that were once unimaginable,” said Paul G. Ambrose, CEO of Prxcision, Inc. “pRxcision® brings cutting-edge AI to the patient’s bedside—empowering clinicians to navigate complex decisions with confidence. We are thrilled about this collaboration and believe it can accelerate the adoption of our technology, driving significant improvements in hospitals across the country.”\n\n**Unlocking New Growth in a Changing Healthcare Landscape** Beyond improving patient care, this collaboration is intended to drive product adoption and create exciting opportunities for growth in a rapidly evolving market. With speed and accuracy at its core, the combined solution can provide hospitals with a powerful tool to improve outcomes and reduce costs. By offering real-time insights and targeted treatment information, T2 Biosystems and Prxcision, Inc. aim to reduce the burden of AMR, helping healthcare systems across the United States take a proactive stance against one of the top global public health threats.\n\n**About T2 Biosystems**T2 Biosystems is commercializing the only FDA-cleared diagnostics capable of detecting sepsis-causing bacterial and fungal pathogens directly from blood in just 3-5 hours—eliminating the need for days-long blood cultures. The T2Bacteria® and T2Candida® Panels identify the most common sepsis-causing pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity, allowing clinicians to act sooner, improve outcomes, and save lives.\n\n**About Prxcision, Inc.**Prxcision, Inc. leverages two decades of expertise in antibiotic development to create a real-time, AI-powered decision support platform. Integrated with electronic health records, pRxcision® provides clinicians with ranked, evidence-based antibiotic regimens tailored to each patient’s needs. This approach helps stop antibiotic misuse, breaks the cycle of resistance, reduces healthcare costs, and ultimately saves lives.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(NASDAQ: TTOO) (the “Company”), a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, today announced that it has entered into a multi-year exclusive U.S. agreement with Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH),. Under the agreement, Cardinal Health will have exclusive rights to sell T2 Biosystems’ FDA-cleared direct-from-blood diagnostics for the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens, including the T2Dx® Instrument, the T2Bacteria® Panel, and the T2Candida® Panel.\n\n“We are thrilled to have entered into a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health that will make them the exclusive distributor of our FDA-cleared direct-from-blood diagnostics in the United States which will dramatically increase our representation with hospital customers who are eager to add culture-independent diagnostics to strengthen their sepsis clinical care,” stated John Sperzel, Chairman and CEO of T2 Biosystems. “We expect this collaboration to greatly expand our access to the U.S. hospital market as Cardinal Health has an extensive commercial and distribution infrastructure that includes capital equipment specialists who will sell the T2Dx Instrument.”\n\nDespite the widespread use of blood culture-based diagnostics to detect sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility, sepsis remains the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals and claims the lives of approximately 350,000 Americans annually.1 Sepsis also represents the leading cost of U.S. hospitalization, costing our healthcare system an estimated $62 billion annually.2 Lastly, sepsis is the leading cause of 30-day hospital readmission in the U.S., with 19% of sepsis survivors re-hospitalized within 30 days and 40% within 90 days,3,4,5 which underscores the need for advanced technologies in sepsis detection.\n\nA September 2024 article which appeared in [The Lancet, titled “The Culture of Blood Culture,](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jb0LNcRwsXUZYahU79PqwWGscrG5qyCxfkIx5OYtjGekG95_nyyQNImiivEUmnbLT_k0clvLBEy3WrAra2XNQUkwMmrwwucxpZwi1GXhAE4BkNN56mH5fyxYVqEzOKDtJrP_TxyzIefCcjkKecvWkOKPnJQ0AVa6J-4S8FekFowMFzCoXdPLEvusH1xTDXZTw7KUwe_bdfYuM_F6m3Ib-R_O3pmioUxRBhP8XwnAvsw6-QcAlMtkMDOWF4AEBUl8LGHv8HpBrNGEFLEYTxOBfdm0NDlJzz0Bu1GfrqyxHhXOoJ0r5rjaovGV1G3wOt9q2EqMFGwxsL2_r-gURX3hJnJ5ZJP8DHFo8-OssVv14mC9ojczNmdCzBLyZCS7EfXbv7RlSJxaSrMjKcFS533OXOaFy0M1yGXYnCB9CJXcjEtqgcU1JmU4ajCDrIC_aPO1Z4-0ddBmyiLQqJaTUOBHNtoM7WTT40ARZ1Yzz_UChGqghCgvhyz4zJFAoRNXHKw2)[”](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eFgbNxC8c-9Hxc827SK_mEBgllLuXgtS6PoJsWjh9FioWOez_nUqCz-NzeQL0e0i3ZokP53G-jyu32XMy15SGCaC0Pq1AascoWxv--m0rR1yb8XctEW3emG44r9RxIc7Mbd2yaPLBNVNSZA4z-AdwLUZp7WwCHif1UeicrCwCs7ejeB9DW3n9Ym2Y_g85ZA7Z006C-lKIyZClwHQAg8kcJlxZQ1GceCoKpj-LVTe-wcAIj6yct-a6DgOC9hvtuUlYXs_ZUptbLzzOjySKWlw9O3T7qdgx27i8z0zpMVSOfQ77lBL41ysd5z51JVjJ_jd3EN50POoxCk9o6170FSi98suLUy3XQlRisksJ61JVYQmqpKU2x2lI4G_wKwih8AbfWXJGpWZrwreBYMFTxmK7lN_4LS8TyrSijCHdYRyMg6NgQE1byEfYB-wKKX2YTMu) described the weakness of blood culture, including poor sensitivity (i.e., missed infections), slow time to result (i.e., typically 2-3 days); vulnerability to contamination; reduced effectiveness in patients who have received antibiotics; and a labor-intensive process requiring skilled technicians.\n\nT2 Biosystems has developed the only FDA-cleared diagnostics able to detect sepsis-causing bacterial and fungal pathogens directly-from-blood, in just 3-5 hours, without the need to wait days for a positive blood culture. The T2Bacteria Panel runs on the FDA cleared T2Dx Instrument and detects six pathogens which account for nearly 75% of U.S. bacterial bloodstream infections, with 90% sensitivity and 98% specificity, including _E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa_ , and _E. coli_. The T2Candida Panel runs on the FDA-cleared T2Dx Instrument and detects five _Candida_ species which account for up to 95% of U.S.  _Candida_ blood stream infections, with 91% sensitivity and 99% specificity, including _C. albicans_ ,  _C. tropicalis_ ,  _C. parapsilosis_ ,  _C. krusei_ , and _C. glabrata_. The T2 Biosystems test panels are not affected by prior antimicrobial treatment.\n\n**About Cardinal Health**Cardinal Health is a distributor of pharmaceuticals, a global manufacturer and distributor of medical and laboratory products, and a provider of performance and data solutions for healthcare facilities.

(NASDAQ: TTOO) (the “Company”), a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, today highlighted a recently published article in The Lancet, a world-leading medical journal. The article titled “Changing the Culture of Blood Culture” was authored by Sally Davies, Richard A Marfuggi, Rick A Bright, Steve Brozak, and Michael Osterholm on September 20, 2024.\n\n“The T2 Biosystems team is commercializing the only FDA-cleared direct-from-blood diagnostics able to rapidly detect bacterial and fungal pathogens, and we applaud the authors for raising awareness of the limitations of blood culture,” stated John Sperzel, Chairman and CEO of T2 Biosystems. “As noted by the authors, rapid culture-independent diagnostics have the potential to improve health outcomes and strengthen the global response to infectious diseases, and T2 Biosystems is working to leverage our technology to further advance the field.”\n\nThe authors highlighted certain weaknesses of blood culture, the ideal characteristics of culture-independent diagnostics, how to move beyond the culture of blood culture, and how to implement rapid culture-independent diagnostics:\n\n  * Weaknesses of blood culture: blood culture has poor sensitivity, especially with low blood volumes; it is time-consuming, typically taking 24-72 hours for initial results; it is vulnerable to contamination; it has reduced effectiveness in people who have received antibiotics; and is a labor-intensive process requiring skilled technicians.\n  * Ideal characteristics of culture-independent diagnostics: culture-independent diagnostic tests need to display proven accuracy (i.e., sensitivity and specificity); they need to be accurate despite previous antimicrobial therapy; they need to provide results in 3-5 hours; they need to detect a range of bacterial, fungal, and antimicrobial resistance pathogens; they need to be low-cost, easy to use, and accessible; and they should have a low cross-contamination risk and low sample volume requirements.\n  * How to move beyond the culture of blood culture: the ongoing crisis in blood-culture availability should encourage the development and implementation of more efficient and resilient diagnostic methods. Moving beyond the culture of blood culture will require changes to reimbursement codes and practices for new diagnostic technologies. Governments, health-care systems, and private-sector entities should designate funding for new diagnostic technologies. Frugal innovation will be important in these efforts, combining state-of-the-art technologies with cost-effective solutions to make advancements accessible, even in resource-limited settings.\n  * Implementation of rapid, culture-independent diagnostics: rapid, accurate diagnostics should be integrated into antimicrobial-stewardship programs to enable targeted therapy. Once implemented, global collaboration is needed to share best practices, coordinate research efforts, and ensure equitable access to new diagnostics. Culture-independent diagnostics have the potential to improve health outcomes and strengthen the global response to infectious diseases.\n\n\n\n**About the T2Bacterial Panel**The T2Bacteria® Panel is the only FDA-cleared diagnostic test able to detect sepsis-causing bacterial species directly-from-blood, in just 3-5 hours, without the need to wait days for a positive blood culture. The T2Bacteria Panel runs on the FDA-cleared T2Dx® Instrument and simultaneously detects six bacterial species with 90% sensitivity and 98% specificity, including, _Enterococcus faecium_ ,  _Staphylococcus aureus_ ,  _Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli._ The six species detected by the T2Bacteria Panel account for nearly 75% of all bacterial bloodstream infections in the U.S.\n\n**About the T2Candida Panel**The T2Candida® Panel is the only FDA-cleared diagnostic test able to detect sepsis-causing _Candida_ species directly-from-blood, in just 3-5 hours, without the need to wait days for a positive blood culture. The T2Candida Panel runs on the FDA-cleared T2Dx Instrument and simultaneously detects five _Candida_ species with 91% sensitivity and 99% specificity, including, _Candida albicans_ ,  _Candida tropicalis_ ,  _Candida parapsilosis_ ,  _Candida krusei_ , and _Candida glabrata_. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the five species detected by the T2Candida Panel account for up to 95% of all _Candida_ bloodstream infections in the U.S.\n\n**About the T2Resistance Panel**The T2Resistance® Panel is a CE-marked diagnostic test able to detect antibiotic resistance genes directly-from-blood, in just 3-5 hours, without the need to wait days for a positive blood culture. The T2Resistance Panel runs on the FDA-cleared T2Dx Instrument and simultaneously detects thirteen antibiotic resistance genes from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, including KPC, OXA-48, CTX-M-14/15, AmpC (CMY/DHA), NDM/IMP/VIM, mecA/C, and vanA/B. The T2Resistance Panel is marketed and sold in Europe under a CE-mark and was granted Breakthrough Device designation from the FDA, which will provide for a prioritized FDA review process.\n\n**About T2 Biosystems**T2 Biosystems, a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, is dedicated to improving patient care and reducing the cost of care by helping clinicians effectively treat patients faster than ever before. T2 Biosystems’ products are powered by the proprietary T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR®) technology and include the T2Dx® Instrument, the T2Bacteria® Panel, the T2Candida® Panel, the T2Resistance® Panel, and the T2Biothreat™ Panel.

(NASDAQ:TTOO) (the “Company”), a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, today announced that it has received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its FDA-cleared T2Candida® Panel for pediatric patients. The Company expects to immediately begin marketing and selling the T2Candida Panel under the expanded pediatric claim.\n\nThe T2Candida Panel is the only FDA-cleared diagnostic test able to detect sepsis-causing _Candida_ species directly-from-blood, in just 3-5 hours, without the need to wait days for a positive blood culture. The T2Candida Panel runs on the FDA-cleared T2Dx® Instrument and simultaneously detects five _Candida_ species including, _Candida albicans_ ,  _Candida tropicalis_ ,  _Candida parapsilosis_ ,  _Candida krusei_ , and _Candida glabrata_. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the five species detected by the T2Candida Panel account for up to 95% of all _Candida_ bloodstream infections in the U.S.\n\n\"This FDA clearance marks another important milestone in our commitment to expand the clinical utility of our sepsis test panels and allows our commercial team to immediately begin marketing and selling our test to over 200 children’s hospitals in the U.S.,” stated John Sperzel, Chairman and CEO of T2 Biosystems. “Studies show that the T2Candida Panel detects _Candida_ species significantly faster, and with greater sensitivity, when compared to blood culture-based diagnostics, and we believe the new pediatric testing claim will allow clinicians to improve outcomes and reduce cost by achieving faster targeted antifungal treatment for their pediatric patients.”\n\n_According to the Journal of Fungi_, a peer-reviewed scientific journal that provides an advanced forum for studies related to pathogenic fungi, _Candida_ species are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in hospitalized children. Moreover, children with invasive candidiasis present a significant burden to the U.S. healthcare system, with a mean increased hospital length of stay of 21 days and approximately $92,000 in excess hospital costs.\n\nA _Journal of Clinical Microbiology _(2022) study conducted at the Bambino Gesù hospital in Rome, Italy found that pediatric patients suspected of fungal bloodstream infections that were tested with the T2Candida Panel received species identification results 121.8 hours faster compared to blood culture. The study also found a higher detection rate with the T2Candida Panel, as six additional probable or possible fungal bloodstream infections in pediatric patients were detected by the T2Candida Panel that were missed by blood culture. In addition, a prospective observational study published in _Clinical Infectious Diseases_ (2022) evaluated the performance of four pre-blood culture tests for detecting the presence of invasive candidiasis in pediatric patients and found that the T2Candida Panel had the highest sensitivity and specificity of all four assays among five hundred patients enrolled. The T2Candida Panel was the only test recommended for individual use as a tool for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in at-risk children and adolescents.\n\n**About T2 Biosystems**T2 Biosystems, a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, is dedicated to improving patient care and reducing the cost of care by helping clinicians effectively treat patients faster than ever before.

(NASDAQ:TTOO) (the “Company”), a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, today provided an update on its new product development pipeline progress. The Company’s product pipeline is focused on direct-from-blood diagnostic tests for antimicrobial resistance (AMR), pediatric _Candida_ infections, Lyme disease, and _Candida auris_.\n\n**Pipeline Progress Highlights**\n\n  * Finalizing a 510(k) premarket notification application for the T2Resistance® Panel planned to be filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * The previously submitted 510(k) premarket notification to expand use of the T2Candida® Panel to detect pediatric _Candida_ infections is pending clearance with the FDA.\n  * Advanced internal validation and plans to submit a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA to expand the use of its FDA-cleared T2Bacteria® Panel to detect pediatric bacterial infections.\n  * The Company maintains its plan to launch the T2Lyme™ Panel as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT); however, it now plans to build or buy its own laboratory rather than launch through a partnership.\n  * Pursuing non-dilutive funding to complete the development, validation, and clinical studies for a diagnostic test to detect _Candida auris_ , following the completion of feasibility and early development in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\n\n“Our team is making excellent progress developing novel diagnostics to rapidly detect pathogens directly-from-blood, including antimicrobial resistance, pediatric _Candida_ infections, Lyme disease, and _Candida auris,_ and we expect to launch multiple new products in 2024 and 2025,” stated John Sperzel, Chairman and CEO of T2 Biosystems. “Three of our pipeline products have received FDA Breakthrough Device designation, including the T2Resistance Panel, the T2Lyme Panel, and the _Candida auris_ test, and we believe all four of our pipeline products will allow clinicians to achieve faster targeted treatment, reduce cost, and improve patient outcomes.”\n\n**Antimicrobial resistance** According to the CDC, antimicrobial resistance is an urgent global public health threat. To address the threat caused by AMR, the Company has developed the T2Resistance Panel, a direct-from-blood molecular diagnostic test that runs on the FDA-cleared T2Dx® Instrument and simultaneously detects 13 antibiotic resistance genes, in just 3-5 hours, without the need to wait days for a positive blood culture.\n\nIn March 2024, the results of a new study were published in _Journal of_  _Clinical Microbiology_ highlighting the benefits of the T2Resistance Panel compared to blood culture and standard microbiology methods, including high accuracy (i.e., 94.7% sensitivity, 97.4% specificity), rapid turnaround time (i.e., results available is 4.4 hours vs. 58.3 hours), and clinical impact (i.e., clinical interventions in 41% of patients in the study, or 24 of 59 patients).\n\nThe Company plans to submit a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA during the fourth quarter of 2024 and expects to receive a prioritized FDA review given the T2Resistance Panel previously received FDA Breakthrough Device designation.\n\n**Pediatric Sepsis** According to the Children’s Hospital Association, sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitalized children, more than cancer. To address the threat of pediatric sepsis, the Company is pursuing pediatric claims for its T2Candida® Panel and T2Bacteria® Panel, the only FDA-cleared products able to detect sepsis-causing fungal and bacterial pathogens direct-from-blood, in just 3-5 hours, without the need to wait days for a positive blood culture.\n\n_According to the Journal of Fungi_, a peer-reviewed scientific journal that provides an advanced forum for studies related to pathogenic fungi, _Candida_ species are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in hospitalized children. Additionally, children with invasive candidiasis present a significant burden to the U.S. healthcare system, with a mean increased hospital length of stay of 21 days and approximately $92,000 in excess hospital costs. A _Journal of Clinical Microbiology _(2022) study conducted at the Bambino Gesù hospital in Rome, Italy found that pediatric patients suspected of fungal bloodstream infections that were tested with the T2Candida Panel received species identification results 121.8 hours faster compared to blood culture.\n\nThe Company previously submitted a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA to expand the use of its FDA-cleared T2Candida Panel to include pediatric testing, and the indication is pending FDA clearance. The Company also plans to submit a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA to expand the use of its FDA-cleared T2Bacteria Panel to include pediatric testing.\n\n**Lyme Disease** According to the CDC, Lyme disease is the leading vector-borne disease in the U.S., with an estimated 3.4 million tests performed each year at a cost of nearly $500 million. The current diagnostic process is a two-tiered antibody test algorithm that relies on the presence of antibodies, and which is only accurate four to eight weeks after infection. During those weeks, the bacteria may spread throughout the body and become much harder to eradicate and treat effectively, and may lead to chronic, debilitating disease.\n\nTo address this critical unmet need, the Company has developed the T2Lyme Panel, a direct-from-blood molecular diagnostic test for the early detection of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ , the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States. Early detection and appropriate treatment are essential, as untreated _Borrelia burgdorferi_ infections may spread throughout the body and lead to chronic, debilitating Lyme disease. The T2Lyme Panel has been designed to be a highly sensitive detection of an infection and is expected to detect Lyme disease within the first 30 days post infection, compared to antibody tests that can take 30-60 days post infection.\n\nThe Company has made an important strategic decision regarding the commercialization of the T2Lyme Panel. The Company maintains its plan to launch the T2Lyme Panel as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT); however, it now plans to build or buy its own laboratory rather than to do so through a partnership. While this is expected to delay the intended launch of the test beyond the third quarter of 2024, the Company believes this strategy will be in the best long-term interest of its stockholders as it is expected to ultimately result in higher profit margins, give the Company complete control of its Lyme business, and also provide the potential to use the Lyme laboratory for other tests developed by the Company.\n\nWhile the Company plans to launch the T2Lyme Panel as an LDT, it intends to submit a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and, it will expect to receive a prioritized FDA review given the T2Lyme Panel previously received FDA Breakthrough Device designation.\n\n**_Candida auris_** According to the World Health Organization, _Candida auris_ is a multidrug-resistant pathogen labeled as a growing threat to public health. A 2023 Wall Street Journal report described _Candida auris_ as a “deadly fungus spreading across the U.S., mostly in healthcare facilities,” with a mortality rate of up to 60%. According to the CDC, _Candida auris_ is difficult to identify with standard laboratory methods, which can lead to inappropriate treatment, and some strains are resistant to all three available classes of antifungal therapies.\n\nTo address this global threat, the Company intends to expand its direct-from-blood T2Candida Panel to include the detection of _Candida auris_. The FDA-cleared T2Candida Panel currently covers approximately 90% of _Candida_ species commonly found in bloodstream infections. The addition of _Candida auris_ should provide important coverage for infections caused by this pathogen which are becoming increasingly more prevalent.\n\nT2 Biosystems previously collaborated with the CDC to complete feasibility and early development of a diagnostic test to detect _Candida auris_ , and the Company believes it is possible to receive non-dilutive funding to complete the development, validation, and clinical studies. The FDA previously granted the T2 _Candida auris_ test Breakthrough Device designation, so the Company is having interactive dialog with the FDA and expects to receive a prioritized review upon submission of a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA.\n\n**About T2 Biosystems**T2 Biosystems, a leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes, is dedicated to improving patient care and reducing the cost of care by helping clinicians effectively treat patients faster than ever before. T2 Biosystems’ products are powered by the proprietary T2 Magnetic Resonance (T2MR®) technology and include the T2Dx® Instrument, the T2Bacteria® Panel, the T2Candida® Panel, the T2Resistance® Panel, and the T2Biothreat™ Panel.
