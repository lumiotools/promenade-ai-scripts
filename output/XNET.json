The third quarter performance was led by double-digit growth in subscription business. While the total revenues decreased year-over-year due to the downsizing of our domestic audio live streaming business last year and lower cloud computing sales, we have successfully carried out diversified measures to mitigate their impact,” said Mr. Jinbo Li, Chairman and CEO of Xunlei.\n\n“We are confident in our business outlook and have been actively implementing our new share repurchase plan announced in June this year. Looking ahead, we will continue to push boundaries, explore untapped potential and ultimately create values for our shareholders,” concluded Mr. Li.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total Revenues**\n\nTotal revenues were US$80.1 million, representing a decrease of 4.9% year-over-year. The decrease in total revenues was mainly attributable to the decrease in our revenues from live streaming and cloud computing businesses.\n\nRevenues from cloud computing were US$25.3 million, representing a decrease of 14.4% year-over-year. The decrease in cloud computing revenues was mainly due to the reduced sale of our cloud computing services and a decline in sales of cloud computing hardware devices as a result of heightened competition and evolving regulatory environment.\n\nRevenues from subscription were US$33.2 million, representing an increase of 15.6% year-over-year. The increase in subscription revenues was mainly driven by the increase in the number of subscribers. The number of subscribers was 5.51 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with 5.02 million as of September 30, 2023. The average revenue per subscriber for the third quarter was RMB40.9, compared with RMB39.9 in the same period of 2023. The higher average revenue per subscriber was mainly attributable to an increase in the proportion of users who signed up for our premium membership services.\n\nRevenues from live streaming and other IVAS were US$21.6 million, representing a decrease of 16.7% year-over-year. The decrease of live streaming and other IVAS revenues was mainly due to the downsizing of our domestic audio live streaming operations since June 2023, which was partially offset by the increase in the revenues from our overseas audio live streaming business.\n\n**Costs of Revenues**\n\nCosts of revenues were US$39.4 million, representing 49.1% of our total revenues, compared with US$46.4 million, or 55.1% of the total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease in costs of revenues was mainly attributable to the decrease in bandwidth costs as well as revenue-sharing costs for our live streaming business incurred during the quarter.\n\nBandwidth costs, as included in costs of revenues, were US$24.8 million, representing 31.0% of our total revenues, compared with US$28.1 million, or 33.4% of the total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the enhanced utilization efficiency and decrease in revenues from cloud computing services during the quarter.\n\nThe remaining costs of revenues mainly consisted of costs related to the revenue-sharing from our live streaming business, payment handling charges and cost of inventories sold.\n\n**Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin**\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was US$40.5 million, representing an increase of 7.8% year-over-year. Gross profit margin was 50.5% in the third quarter, compared with 44.6% in the same period of 2023. The increase in gross profit was mainly driven by the increased gross profit from our subscription business. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the higher weighting of subscription revenues in our total revenue mix, which have a higher gross profit margin.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses**\n\nResearch and development expenses for the third quarter were US$17.7 million, representing 22.1% of our total revenues, compared with US$19.5 million, or 23.1% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in labor cost.\n\n**Sales and Marketing Expenses**\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the third quarter were US$11.5 million, representing 14.3% of our total revenues, compared with US$9.5 million, or 11.3% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to more marketing expenses incurred for our subscription and overseas audio live streaming businesses.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter were US$11.4 million, representing 14.2% of our total revenues, compared with US$11.1 million, or 13.2% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in labor costs, partially offset by the decrease in one-off impairment of servers and network equipment.\n\n**Operating Loss**\n\nOperating loss was US$0.2 million, compared with an operating loss of US$2.5 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in operating loss was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit of subscription and overseas audio live streaming businesses, partially offset by the increase in marketing expenses during the quarter.\n\n**Other Income, Net**\n\nOther income, net was US$4.8 million, compared with other income, net of US$7.3 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to less reversal of payables with low payment probability as compared with the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net Income and Earnings Per ADS**\n\nNet income was US$4.4 million, same as US$4.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was US$4.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with US$5.5 million in the same period of 2023.\n\nDiluted earnings per ADS in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately US$0.07, same as US$0.07 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Cash Balance**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$272.0 million, compared with US$263.4 million as of June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly due to the net cash inflow from operating activities, partially offset by the repayment of bank loans and spending on share buybacks.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nOn June 4, 2024, Xunlei announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new plan for the repurchase of up to US$20 million of its ADSs or shares over the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had spent approximately US$1.5 million on share buybacks under the new share repurchase program.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of 588,025 ADSs for a total of US$1.0 million.\n\n**Guidance for the Fourth Quarter of 2024**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Xunlei estimates total revenues to be between US$77 million and US$82 million, and the midpoint of the range represents a quarter-over-quarter decrease of approximately 0.7%. This estimate represents management's preliminary view as of the date of this press release, which is subject to change and any change could be material.\n\n**Conference Call Information.**\n\nXunlei's management will host a conference call at 7:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time on November 14, 2024 (8:00 p.m. Beijing/Hong Kong Time), to discuss the Company's quarterly results and recent business developments.\n\nParticipant Online Registration: [https://register.vevent.com/register/BI548168feaf884dee90e66d28f4bee648](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=l8AD0QpeEWP92L0EG-jhDUcUF2IIfM2x8RZ6nGQ-3d9mA6smr9RGC_LK5b9HZ8XeuT7s-c9FDSaNl9A0zDeVIA4dHRpkuxZz-08mbLCX2iCtyxMNiWDhEkOgUoKNuShDnhC9Q5cD8Ph_VLx5AUQhWva3rO7hw4iPkq8-QhUTHUWtFkMod27ex7bYCrHU-b1FVut92KaxVJa_k-LtcUBo14meSurVHnVC322gd0OdgAs=)\n\nPlease register to join the conference using the link provided above and dial in 10 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nXunlei believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses, which is not expected to result in future cash payments. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Xunlei's historical performance and assist the Company's financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charge that has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a recurring expense in Xunlei's results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying reconciliation tables at the end of this release include details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.\n\n**XUNLEI LIMITED**  \n---  \nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS  \n(Amounts expressed in thousands of USD, except for share, per share (or ADS) data)  \n**September 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**US$**| **US$**  \n**Assets**  \n**Current assets:**  \nCash and cash equivalents| 133,436| 170,802  \nShort-term investments| 138,596| 101,078  \nAccounts receivable, net| 32,173| 31,210  \nInventories| 1,465| 2,219  \nDue from related parties| 31,884| 12,644  \nPrepayments and other current assets| 10,827| 9,423  \n**Total current assets**| **348,381**| **327,376**  \n**Non-current assets:**  \nRestricted cash| 523| -  \nLong-term investments| 30,768| 32,134  \nDeferred tax assets| 784| 478  \nProperty and equipment, net| 57,975| 60,028  \nIntangible assets, net| 8,999| 5,697  \nGoodwill| 21,050| 20,826  \nDue from a related party, non-current portion| -| 19,619  \nLong-term prepayments and other non-current assets| 3,155| 1,953  \nOperating lease assets| 349| 575  \n**Total assets**| **471,984**| **468,686**  \n**Liabilities**  \n**Current liabilities:**  \nAccounts payable| 24,933| 24,430  \nDue to related parties| 18| -  \nContract liabilities, current portion| 38,493| 36,375  \nLease liabilities| 162| 276  \nIncome tax payable| 8,170| 6,391  \nAccrued liabilities and other payables| 47,457| 53,708  \nShort-term bank borrowings and current portion of long-term bank borrowings| 71| 6,906  \n**Total current liabilities**| **119,304**| **128,086**  \n**Non-current liabilities:**  \nContract liabilities, non-current portion| 516| 846  \nLease liabilities, non-current portion| 134| 229  \nDeferred tax liabilities| 988| 513  \nBank borrowings, non-current portion| 14,270| 15,539  \n**Total liabilities**| **135,212**| **145,213**  \n**Equity**  \nCommon shares (US$0.00025 par value, 1,000,000,000 shares authorized, 375,001,940 shares issued and 323,525,556 shares outstanding as at December 31, 2023;

The third quarter performance was led by double-digit growth in subscription business. While the total revenues decreased year-over-year due to the downsizing of our domestic audio live streaming business last year and lower cloud computing sales, we have successfully carried out diversified measures to mitigate their impact,” said Mr. Jinbo Li, Chairman and CEO of Xunlei.\n\n“We are confident in our business outlook and have been actively implementing our new share repurchase plan announced in June this year. Looking ahead, we will continue to push boundaries, explore untapped potential and ultimately create values for our shareholders,” concluded Mr. Li.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total Revenues**\n\nTotal revenues were US$80.1 million, representing a decrease of 4.9% year-over-year. The decrease in total revenues was mainly attributable to the decrease in our revenues from live streaming and cloud computing businesses.\n\nRevenues from cloud computing were US$25.3 million, representing a decrease of 14.4% year-over-year. The decrease in cloud computing revenues was mainly due to the reduced sale of our cloud computing services and a decline in sales of cloud computing hardware devices as a result of heightened competition and evolving regulatory environment.\n\nRevenues from subscription were US$33.2 million, representing an increase of 15.6% year-over-year. The increase in subscription revenues was mainly driven by the increase in the number of subscribers. The number of subscribers was 5.51 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with 5.02 million as of September 30, 2023. The average revenue per subscriber for the third quarter was RMB40.9, compared with RMB39.9 in the same period of 2023. The higher average revenue per subscriber was mainly attributable to an increase in the proportion of users who signed up for our premium membership services.\n\nRevenues from live streaming and other IVAS were US$21.6 million, representing a decrease of 16.7% year-over-year. The decrease of live streaming and other IVAS revenues was mainly due to the downsizing of our domestic audio live streaming operations since June 2023, which was partially offset by the increase in the revenues from our overseas audio live streaming business.\n\n**Costs of Revenues**\n\nCosts of revenues were US$39.4 million, representing 49.1% of our total revenues, compared with US$46.4 million, or 55.1% of the total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease in costs of revenues was mainly attributable to the decrease in bandwidth costs as well as revenue-sharing costs for our live streaming business incurred during the quarter.\n\nBandwidth costs, as included in costs of revenues, were US$24.8 million, representing 31.0% of our total revenues, compared with US$28.1 million, or 33.4% of the total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the enhanced utilization efficiency and decrease in revenues from cloud computing services during the quarter.\n\nThe remaining costs of revenues mainly consisted of costs related to the revenue-sharing from our live streaming business, payment handling charges and cost of inventories sold.\n\n**Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin**\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was US$40.5 million, representing an increase of 7.8% year-over-year. Gross profit margin was 50.5% in the third quarter, compared with 44.6% in the same period of 2023. The increase in gross profit was mainly driven by the increased gross profit from our subscription business. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the higher weighting of subscription revenues in our total revenue mix, which have a higher gross profit margin.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses**\n\nResearch and development expenses for the third quarter were US$17.7 million, representing 22.1% of our total revenues, compared with US$19.5 million, or 23.1% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in labor cost.\n\n**Sales and Marketing Expenses**\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the third quarter were US$11.5 million, representing 14.3% of our total revenues, compared with US$9.5 million, or 11.3% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to more marketing expenses incurred for our subscription and overseas audio live streaming businesses.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter were US$11.4 million, representing 14.2% of our total revenues, compared with US$11.1 million, or 13.2% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the increase in labor costs, partially offset by the decrease in one-off impairment of servers and network equipment.\n\n**Operating Loss**\n\nOperating loss was US$0.2 million, compared with an operating loss of US$2.5 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in operating loss was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit of subscription and overseas audio live streaming businesses, partially offset by the increase in marketing expenses during the quarter.\n\n**Other Income, Net**\n\nOther income, net was US$4.8 million, compared with other income, net of US$7.3 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to less reversal of payables with low payment probability as compared with the same period of 2023.\n\n**Net Income and Earnings Per ADS**\n\nNet income was US$4.4 million, same as US$4.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was US$4.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with US$5.5 million in the same period of 2023.\n\nDiluted earnings per ADS in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately US$0.07, same as US$0.07 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Cash Balance**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$272.0 million, compared with US$263.4 million as of June 30, 2024. The increase was mainly due to the net cash inflow from operating activities, partially offset by the repayment of bank loans and spending on share buybacks.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nOn June 4, 2024, Xunlei announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new plan for the repurchase of up to US$20 million of its ADSs or shares over the next 12 months. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had spent approximately US$1.5 million on share buybacks under the new share repurchase program.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of 588,025 ADSs for a total of US$1.0 million.\n\n**Guidance for the Fourth Quarter of 2024**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Xunlei estimates total revenues to be between US$77 million and US$82 million, and the midpoint of the range represents a quarter-over-quarter decrease of approximately 0.7%. This estimate represents management's preliminary view as of the date of this press release, which is subject to change and any change could be material.\n\n**Conference Call Information.**\n\nXunlei's management will host a conference call at 7:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time on November 14, 2024 (8:00 p.m. Beijing/Hong Kong Time), to discuss the Company's quarterly results and recent business developments.\n\nParticipant Online Registration: [https://register.vevent.com/register/BI548168feaf884dee90e66d28f4bee648](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=l8AD0QpeEWP92L0EG-jhDUcUF2IIfM2x8RZ6nGQ-3d9mA6smr9RGC_LK5b9HZ8XeuT7s-c9FDSaNl9A0zDeVIA4dHRpkuxZz-08mbLCX2iCtyxMNiWDhEkOgUoKNuShDnhC9Q5cD8Ph_VLx5AUQhWva3rO7hw4iPkq8-QhUTHUWtFkMod27ex7bYCrHU-b1FVut92KaxVJa_k-LtcUBo14meSurVHnVC322gd0OdgAs=)\n\nPlease register to join the conference using the link provided above and dial in 10 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates\" and similar statements. Among other things, the management's quotations and the \"Guidance\" section in this press release, as well as the Company's strategic, operational and acquisition plans, contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and the industry. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: the Company's ability to continue to innovate and provide attractive products and services to retain and grow its user base; the Company's ability to keep up with technological developments and users' changing demands in the internet industry; the Company's ability to convert its users into subscribers of its premium services; the Company's ability to deal with existing and potential copyright infringement claims and other related claims; the Company’s ability to react to the governmental actions for its scrutiny of internet content in China and the Company's ability to compete effectively. Although the Company believes that the expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot assure you that its expectations will turn out to be correct, and investors are cautioned that actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results. Further information regarding risks and uncertainties faced by the Company is included in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All information provided in this press release is as of the date of the press release, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent occurring events or circumstances, or changes in its expectations, except as may be required by law.\n\n**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement Xunlei's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), Xunlei uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission: (1) non-GAAP operating income, (2) non-GAAP net income, (3) non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share for common shares, and (4) non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nXunlei believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses, which is not expected to result in future cash payments. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Xunlei's historical performance and assist the Company's financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charge that has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a recurring expense in Xunlei's results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure.

Specifically, our subscription business has demonstrated robust performance with an increase in revenue of 10.8% year-over-year due to our continued iteration of our product features and cultivation of our user community. Furthermore, we successfully launched Xunlei Browser on major platforms, excelling in delivering exceptional experiences in video streaming, web browsing, and novel reading. We are thrilled to receive overwhelmingly positive user feedback and intend to launch additional products in the coming days to better serve our customers.”\n\n“In the second half of 2024, our primary focus will be on delivering refined products and services to our customers. We will continue diversifying our product portfolio, innovating interactive features, and organizing tailored local operations to further boost user penetration and drive global business growth. With a strong balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to invest in new initiatives. Looking ahead, we remain committed to expanding our business to create long-term value and foster sustainable growth,” concluded Mr. Li.\n\n**Second****Q****uarter****2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total Revenues**\n\nTotal revenues were US$79.6 million, representing a decrease of 23.7% year-over-year. The decrease in total revenues was mainly attributable to the decreased revenues from our live streaming business as a result of the downsizing of our domestic audio live streaming operations since June 2023.\n\nRevenues from cloud computing were US$26.4 million, representing a decrease of 13.8% year-over-year. The decrease in cloud computing revenues was mainly due to the decreased revenues generated from certain of our major customers of the cloud computing services and a decline in sales of cloud computing hardware devices.\n\nRevenues from subscription were US$32.9 million, representing an increase of 10.8% year-over-year. The increase in subscription revenues was mainly driven by the increase in the number of subscribers. The number of subscribers was 5.71 million as of June 30, 2024, compared with 4.72 million as of June 30, 2023. The average revenue per subscriber for the second quarter was RMB39.5, compared with RMB42.9 in the same period of 2023. The lower average revenue per subscriber was due to more promotional activities during the quarter.\n\nRevenues from live streaming and other IVAS were US$20.3 million, representing a decrease of 53.9% year-over-year. The decrease of live streaming and other IVAS revenues was mainly due to the downsizing of our domestic audio live streaming operations since June 2023, which was partially offset by the increase in the revenues from our overseas audio live streaming business.\n\n**Costs of Revenues**\n\nCosts of revenues were US$38.6 million, representing 48.5% of our total revenues, compared with US$58.1 million, or 55.7% of the total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease in costs of revenues was mainly attributable to the decreased revenue-sharing costs for our live streaming business, as well as the decreased bandwidth costs incurred during this quarter.\n\nBandwidth costs, as included in costs of revenues, were US$25.8 million, representing 32.4% of our total revenues, compared with US$28.9 million, or 27.7% of the total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the enhanced utilization efficiency and the decrease in revenues from cloud computing service during the quarter.\n\nThe remaining costs of revenues mainly consisted of costs related to the revenue-sharing arrangement for our live streaming business, payment handling charges, cost of inventories sold and depreciation of servers and other equipment.\n\n**Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin**\n\nGross profit for the second quarter of 2024 was US$40.7 million, representing a decrease of 11.3% year-over-year. Gross profit margin was 51.10% in the second quarter, compared with 44.0% in the same period of 2023. The decrease in gross profit was mainly driven by the decreased gross profit from our live streaming business, partially offset by the increased gross profit from our subscription business. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the higher portion of subscription revenues, which have a higher gross profit margin, and the lower portion of live streaming revenues, which have a relatively lower gross profit margin.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses**\n\nResearch and development expenses for the second quarter were US$17.5 million, representing 21.9% of our total revenues, compared with US$17.2 million, or 16.5% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Sales and Marketing Expenses**\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the second quarter were US$10.9 million, representing 13.7% of our total revenues, compared with US$15.4 million, or 14.7% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in marketing expenses incurred for our live streaming business as result of the downsizing of our domestic audio live streaming operations since June 2023.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the second quarter were US$11.2 million, representing 14.1% of our total revenues, compared with US$12.4 million, or 11.9% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decreased share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by the increase in labor costs during the quarter.\n\n**Operating Income**\n\nOperating income was US$1.0 million, compared with an operating income of US$0.9 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the decrease in marketing expenses and share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by the decrease in gross profit from our live streaming business during the quarter.\n\n**Other Income, Net**\n\nOther income, net was US$2.5 million, compared with other income, net of US$4.7 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in exchange gains and subsidy income received during the quarter.\n\n**Net Income** **and****E****arnings****Per ADS**\n\nNet income was US$2.5 million, compared with US$5.0 million in the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was US$3.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared with US$8.4 million in the same period of 2023. The decreases of net income and non-GAAP net income were primarily attributable to the decrease in gross profit and other income, partially offset by the decrease in operating expenses as discussed above.\n\nDiluted earnings per ADS in the second quarter of 2024 was approximately US$0.04 as compared to US$0.08 in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Cash Balance**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$263.4 million, compared with US$272.5 million as of March 31, 2024. The decrease was mainly due to the net cash outflow from operating activities, spending on share buybacks and payment for the construction of Xunlei headquarters.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nOn June 6, 2023, Xunlei announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to US$20 million of its shares over the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had spent approximately US$4.7 million on share buybacks under the aforesaid share repurchase program.\n\nOn June 4, 2024, Xunlei announced that its Board of Directors had authorized a new plan for the repurchase of up to US$20 million of its shares over the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had spent approximately US$0.5 million on share buybacks under the new share repurchase program.\n\n**Guidance for the****Second****Quarter of****2024**\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, Xunlei estimates total revenues to be between US$81 million and US$86 million, and the midpoint of the range represents a quarter-over-quarter increase of approximately 4.9%. This estimate represents management's preliminary view as of the date of this press release, which is subject to change and any change could be material.\n\n**Conference Call Information.**\n\nXunlei's management will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time on August 13, 2024 (8:00 p.m. Beijing/Hong Kong Time), to discuss the Company's quarterly results and recent business developments.\n\nParticipant Online Registration: https://register.vevent.com/register/BI122c76439b8e42b492824299bb12cecb\n\nPlease register to join the conference using the link provided above and dial in 10 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin.

A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charge that has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a recurring expense in Xunlei's results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying reconciliation tables at the end of this release include details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.\n\n**XUNLEI LIMITED**  \n---  \nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS  \n(Amounts expressed in thousands of USD, except for share, per share (or ADS) data)  \n**June 30,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**US$**| **US$**  \n**Assets**  \n**Current assets:**  \nCash and cash equivalents| 129,338| 170,802  \nShort-term investments| 134,079| 101,078  \nAccounts receivable, net| 32,492| 31,210  \nInventories| 2,018| 2,219  \nDue from related parties| 12,812| 12,644  \nPrepayments and other current assets| 10,124| 9,423  \n**Total current assets**| **320,863**| **327,376**  \n**Non-current assets:**  \nRestricted cash| 514| -  \nLong-term investments| 30,690| 32,134  \nDeferred tax assets| 666| 478  \nProperty and equipment, net| 57,972| 60,028  \nIntangible assets, net| 9,120| 5,697  \nGoodwill| 20,697| 20,826  \nDue from a related party, non-current portion| 19,609| 19,619  \nLong-term prepayments and other non-current assets| 3,306| 1,953  \nRight-of-use assets| 438| 575  \n**Total assets**| **463,875**| **468,686**  \n**Liabilities**  \n**Current liabilities:**  \nAccounts payable| 26,094| 24,430  \nDue to related parties| 17| -  \nContract liabilities, current portion| 38,155| 36,375  \nLease liabilities| 237| 276  \nIncome tax payable| 6,546| 6,391  \nAccrued liabilities and other payables| 43,534| 53,708  \nShort-term bank borrowings and current portion of long-term bank borrowings| 4,209| 6,906  \n**Total current liabilities**| **118,792**| **128,086**  \n**Non-current liabilities:**  \nContract liabilities, non-current portion| 705| 846  \nLease liabilities, non-current portion| 156| 229  \nDeferred tax liabilities| 1,053| 513  \nBank borrowings, non-current portion| 14,032| 15,539  \n**Total liabilities**| **134,738**| **145,213**  \n**Equity**  \nCommon shares (US$0.00025 par value, 1,000,000,000 shares authorized, 375,001,940 shares issued and 323,525,556 shares outstanding as at December 31, 2023;

In particular, our subscription revenue grew by 12.9% year-over-year as a result of a larger premium subscriber base and our continuing efforts on user acquisition. I am deeply grateful to our team for their unwavering efforts to manage and grow our existing businesses while exploring growth opportunities.”\n\n\"During 2024, we will accelerate our efforts to transform our business. Among our initiatives, we intend to proactively embrace decentralized and AI-driven technologies and harness their capabilities to strengthen our operations, enrich user experience and gain a competitive edge as large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a revolutionary technology that will profoundly change our lives. Although we expect it to be an uphill task, we have strong confidence that we can make progress given Xunlei's rich heritage of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. In addition, we will consider all options to make our Company more nimble and focused to pursue growth opportunities,\" concluded Mr. Li.\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total Revenues**\n\nTotal revenues were US$80.4 million, representing a decrease of 19.0% year-over-year. The decrease in total revenues was mainly attributable to the decreased revenues generated from our live streaming business as result of the downsize of our domestic audio live streaming operations since June 2023.\n\nRevenues from cloud computing were US$30.2 million, representing a decrease of 7.8% year-over-year. The decrease in cloud computing revenues was mainly due to the decreased revenues generated from certain of our major customers of cloud computing services and the decrease in sales of cloud computing hardware devices.\n\nRevenues from subscription were US$33.1 million, representing an increase of 12.9% year-over-year. The increase in subscription revenues was mainly driven by the increase in the number of subscribers. The number of subscribers was 5.76 million as of March 31, 2024, compared with 4.84 million as of March 31, 2023. The average revenue per subscriber for the first quarter was RMB39.5, compared with RMB41.0 in the same period of 2023. The lower average revenue per subscriber was due to the more promotional activities we conducted during the quarter.\n\nRevenues from live streaming and other IVAS were US$17.1 million, representing a decrease of 54.1% year-over-year. The decrease of live streaming and other IVAS revenues was mainly due to the downsize of our domestic audio live streaming operations since June 2023.\n\n**Costs of Revenues**\n\nCosts of revenues were US$37.1 million, representing 46.2% of our total revenues, compared with US$59.3 million, or 59.8% of the total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease in costs of revenues was mainly attributable to the decreased revenue-sharing costs for our live streaming business, which was consistent with the decrease in live streaming revenues.\n\nBandwidth costs, as included in costs of revenues, were US$27.1 million, representing 33.8% of our total revenues, compared with US$29.1 million, or 29.3% of the total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decreased bandwidth usage for the development of innovative products and the decrease in revenues of cloud computing service during the quarter.\n\nThe remaining costs of revenues mainly consisted of costs related to the revenue-sharing costs for our live streaming business, payment handling charges, cost of inventories sold and depreciation of servers and other equipment.\n\n**Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin**\n\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was US$42.8 million, representing an increase of 8.2% year-over-year. Gross profit margin was 53.3% in the first quarter, compared with 39.9% in the same period of 2023. The increase in gross profit was mainly driven by the increase in gross profit generated from our subscription business. The increase in gross profit margin was mainly attributable to the increased portion of subscription revenues to total revenues, which has a higher gross profit margin as well as the decreased portion of live streaming revenues to total revenues, which has a relatively lower gross profit margin.\n\n**Research and Development Expenses**\n\nResearch and development expenses for the first quarter were US$17.6 million, representing 22.0% of our total revenues, compared with US$18.0 million, or 18.2% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in employee compensation incurred during the quarter.\n\n**Sales and Marketing Expenses**\n\nSales and marketing expenses for the first quarter were US$10.1 million, representing 12.5% of our total revenues, compared with US$9.3 million, or 9.4% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to more marketing expenses incurred during the quarter for our subscription and overseas live streaming businesses as part of our ongoing efforts on user acquisition.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the first quarter were US$11.1 million, representing 13.9% of our total revenues, compared with US$11.7 million, or 11.8% of our total revenues, in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the decreased share-based compensation expenses, partially offset by the increase in labor costs during the quarter.\n\n**Operating Income**\n\nOperating income was US$4.0 million, compared with an operating income of US$0.7 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit from our subscription business during the quarter.\n\n**Other Income, Net**\n\nOther income, net was US$0.3 million, compared with other income, net of US$1.4 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a one-time write-off for one of our long-term investments and a decrease in subsidy income we received during the quarter.\n\n**Net Income and Earnings Per ADS**\n\nNet income was US$3.6 million, compared with US$1.2 million in the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP net income was US$4.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared with US$5.5 million in the same period of 2023. The increase of net income was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit of our subscription business, partially offset by the decrease in other income as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The decrease in non-GAAP net income was primarily attributable to the increase in labor costs (excluding share-based compensation expenses) as compared with the same period of 2023.\n\nDiluted earnings per ADS in the first quarter of 2024 was approximately US$0.06 as compared to US$0.02 in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Cash Balance**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$272.5 million, compared with US$271.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was mainly due to the net cash generated from operating activities and proceeds from bank borrowings, partially offset by repayment of bank borrowings, spending on share buybacks and payment for a long-term investment during the quarter.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nIn June 2023, Xunlei announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to US$20 million of its shares over the next 12 months. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had spent approximately US$4.7 million on share buybacks under the aforesaid share repurchase program.\n\n**Guidance for the Second Quarter of 2024**\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Xunlei estimates total revenues to be between US$79 million and US$84 million, and the midpoint of the range represents a quarter-over-quarter increase of approximately 1.4%. This estimate represents management's preliminary view as of the date of this press release, which is subject to change and any change could be material.\n\n**Conference Call Information.**\n\nXunlei's management will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time on May 16, 2024 (8:00 p.m. Beijing/Hong Kong Time), to discuss the Company's quarterly results and recent business developments.\n\nParticipant Online Registration: https://register.vevent.com/register/BIdabe6e2da6f24af7b92fb89604dbbb7c\n\nPlease register to join the conference using the link provided above and dial in 10 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin.

These statements are made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"will,\" \"expects,\" \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates\" and similar statements. Among other things, the management's quotations and the \"Guidance\" section in this press release, as well as the Company's strategic, operational and acquisition plans, contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the Company and the industry. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: the Company's ability to continue to innovate and provide attractive products and services to retain and grow its user base; the Company's ability to keep up with technological developments and users' changing demands in the internet industry; the Company's ability to convert its users into subscribers of its premium services; the Company's ability to deal with existing and potential copyright infringement claims and other related claims; the Company’s ability to react to the governmental actions for its scrutiny of internet content in China and the Company's ability to compete effectively.

The presentation of the non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nXunlei believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance by excluding share-based compensation expenses, which is not expected to result in future cash payments. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Xunlei's historical performance and assist the Company's financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charge that has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a recurring expense in Xunlei's results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying reconciliation tables at the end of this release include details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has presented.\n\n**XUNLEI LIMITED**  \n---  \nUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS  \n(Amounts expressed in thousands of USD, except for share, per share (or ADS) data)  \n**March 31,**| **December 31,**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**US$**| **US$**  \n**Assets**  \n**Current assets:**  \nCash and cash equivalents| 127,607| 170,802  \nShort-term investments| 144,902| 101,078  \nAccounts receivable, net| 34,340| 31,210  \nInventories| 1,918| 2,219  \nDue from related parties| 12,915| 12,644  \nPrepayments and other current assets| 10,593| 9,423  \n**Total current assets**| **332,275**| **327,376**  \n**Non-current assets:**  \nRestricted cash| 300| -  \nLong-term investments| 31,700| 32,134  \nDeferred tax assets| 553| 478  \nProperty and equipment, net| 58,430| 60,028  \nIntangible assets, net| 5,732| 5,697  \nGoodwill| 20,790| 20,826  \nDue from a related party, non-current portion| 19,615| 19,619  \nLong-term prepayments and other non-current assets| 3,292| 1,953  \nRight-of-use assets| 483| 575  \n**Total assets**| **473,170**| **468,686**  \n**Liabilities**  \n**Current liabilities:**  \nAccounts payable| 25,513| 24,430  \nDue to related parties| 17| -  \nContract liabilities, current portion| 37,558| 36,375  \nLease liabilities| 375| 276  \nIncome tax payable| 7,892| 6,391  \nAccrued liabilities and other payables| 56,458| 53,708  \nShort-term bank borrowings and current portion of long-term bank borrowings| 7,853| 6,906  \n**Total current liabilities**| **135,666**| **128,086**  \n**Non-current liabilities:**  \nContract liabilities, non-current portion| 881| 846  \nLease liabilities, non-current portion| 136| 229  \nDeferred tax liabilities| 472| 513  \nBank borrowings, non-current portion| 9,251| 15,539  \n**Total liabilities**| **146,406**| **145,213**  \n**Equity**  \nCommon shares (US$0.00025 par value, 1,000,000,000 shares authorized, 375,001,940 shares issued and 323,525,556 shares outstanding as at December 31, 2023;
