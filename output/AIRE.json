          "content": "Exhibit 99.2\nDear Fellow Shareholders:\nLet’s start with a Haiku.\nSmall firm, brave and bold,\nDreams of Fortune500,\nThrives, future unfolds.\n2023 was a memorable year to say the least. The year kicked off with the close of our Regulation A financing\nround campaign, pursuant to which we raised a total of $9.05M. In March, we completed the acquisition of Rhove. In\nApril, we filed our registration statement to start the process of listing on a stock exchange. In May, we sold one of\nour technologies, myAlphie, to a real estate developer for an aggregate amount of $5.85 million. Then, in October we\nwere able to list on Nasdaq and, shortly thereafter raised gross proceeds of $8.00 million in November through a\nfollow-on public offering.\nAll the while, we were facing challenges such as escalating federal interest rates, inflation, rising home prices,\nand global conflicts impacting the economy. Fortunately, we saw these headwinds approaching and successfully\nnavigated through them, disposing of all of our properties, and reinvesting the proceeds into developing our artificial\nintelligence (“AI”) technologies for application in the real estate property technology market. Consequently, we re-\nevaluated our short-term rental operations and strategy, and as a result, we determined to put these operations on hold\nto focus on the development of our AI technologies.\nWe ended the year strong with two announcements: the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire\nNaamche, an AI development studio, and the execution of a non-binding letter of intent to acquire United Software\nGroup, a multi-industry information technology consulting company. To the extent we complete both acquisitions, we\nbelieve they will expand the talent density of our team. As you may have noticed in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nKT, and from recent announcements, we have begun to allocate more resources and time towards improving our AI\ntechnologies and pursuing accretive acquisitions. The reasons for that are threefold:\n1. Our market analysis has shown a highly fragmented real estate technology landscape - there are over\n10,000 real estate technology companies across the industry.1\n2. The real estate industry has been historically slow to adapt to new technologies, which provides the\nopportunity for us to capture market share in the rapidly evolving proptech industry.2\n3. The exponential growth of the AI industry has shown us a path forward where we believe our\ntechnologies can disrupt the real estate industry as a whole.\nTo capitalize on these opportunities, we are pursuing various acquisitions as well as developing products and\nservices across the real estate industry. We have been developing AI technologies for real estate since February 2021,\nso we believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the current AI industry wave and any related industry\ndevelopments that we believe may come.\nTo better explain the company reAlpha has become and what we aim to achieve beyond the short-term rental\nindustry, we have updated our mission statement accordingly:\nOur vision: to be the global leader in real estate technology.\nWe have also refreshed our company’s values:\n● Integrity: Deliver promises with honesty, principles, and ethics.\n● Leadership: Empower everyone to harness strengths and lead with expertise.\n● Openness: Welcome diversity in thought. The best idea wins.\n● Velocity: Operate with a 12-week year mindset.\n● Excellence = (Intent * Concentration) ^ Execution\nLastly, in February 2024, we announced three appointments of executive officers. Michael J. Logozzo,\npreviously our Chief Financial Officer, has been appointed to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer to\ndrive the execution of our strategy and focus on daily operations. Michael Frenz, previously our Senior Vice President\nof Corporate Finance, has now been appointed to the Chief Financial Officer role. He was previously the CFO of\nClipper Realty (NYSE: CLPR) and brings significant experience in investment banking. In addition, to demonstrate\nour dedication to the development of our AI-driven technologies, we’ve created the role of Chief Product Officer and\nJorge Aldecoa, previously our Chief Operating Officer, has been appointed to this role.\nWe believe the future of real estate technology comes with many anticipated and unknown challenges, as\nwell as great opportunities. Rest assured, our dedicated team will always be passionately working to position our\ncompany not only to win the battles, but to remain victorious in the years to come. We remain committed to operating\nleaner and faster, as well as finding ways to make reAlpha a better place to work every day, and we hope to continue\nattracting world-class talent with the intent to work towards our vision to be the global leader in the real estate\ntechnology market.\nA big thank you to all of our employees, customers, stockholders, partners, advisors, and everyone else who\nhas helped us along the way. We are so glad you are on this journey with us and we are eager to see what 2024 and\nbeyond brings.\nGiri Devanur\nChief Executive Officer\nMarch 12, 2024\nSources:\n(1) RealForce. “4 Reasons Why Real Estate Firms Are Slow to Tech Adoption.” RealForce, [URL:\nhttps://www.realforce.com/feed/4-reasons-why-real-estate-firms-are-slow-to-tech-adoption].\n(2) Ascendix Tech. “PropTech Market Map.” Ascendix Tech, [URL: https://ascendixtech.com/proptech-market-\nmap/#:~:text=According%20to%20JLL%2C%20500%20companies,to%20%244%20billion%20in%202022]."
