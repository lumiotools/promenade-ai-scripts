          "content": "## Privacy Policy\n\n**Effective Date: December 10, 2020**\n\n**Scope** Pulse Biosciences, Inc. (“Pulse Biosciences”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting and maintaining your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we use, disclose, transfer, and retain information about you that we collect when you visit our websites (collectively, the “Sites”) or when it is shared with us by our business partners and customers. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Pulse Biosciences does not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage, including operators of websites that link to or from our Sites.\n\n**What information do we collect?**\n\nWe collect personal information, which is information that can be used to identify or contact an individual person. Personal information under this Privacy Policy can be categorized and is described below.\n\n  1. Contact information may include your name, personal or business address, email, telephone number, fax number, or business contact information such as an organization name, or job title. Contact information about you may be collected when you visit our Sites or engage us about our products.\n  2. Site interactions information may include information that you have provided or created for identify or preference purposes, such as a username, password, identifiers unique to yourself for our Sites, business or medical practice name, or marketing preferences.\n  3. Site usage information may include information that is collected from you or your device when you engage our Sites, such as an internet protocol (“IP”) address, computer or mobile device name, browser type, operating system, or your navigation and clickstream behavior from actions that you take on our website. Site usage information may not always include personal information but may be combined with personal information that has been collected separately.\n\n\n\nSome information, in isolation, may not identify an individual and may not be personal information. However, when that information is combined with personal information about an individual, it may then become part of a data set of personal information related to that individual. When combined in this manner, we will treat the data set as personal information.\n\n**How do we collect your personal information?**\n\nWe collect personal information about you when you visit and use our Sites as well as when you inquire or engage us regarding our services or products. The personal information that we collect about you is that which you choose to share with us in registration, when using our products and services, when responding to offers from Pulse Biosciences, or when responding to offers from our business partners or customers.\n\n**How do we use personal information?**\n\nPulse Biosciences will use the personal information we collect about you as permitted by the terms of collection at the time you share your personal information. These terms of collection will be available at that time and we recommend that you review them in advance. The uses of personal information by Pulse Biosciences may include the following:\n\n  * Provide information and services requested, and market products that may be of interest to you.\n  * Determine eligibility for certain products, programs and services.\n  * Conduct processing necessary to fulfill contractual obligations for customers or individuals.\n  * Understand and assess the ongoing needs of our customers.\n  * Deliver customer and other business communications.\n  * Administration of services, billing, and operations.\n  * Conduct analysis to understand how the Sites are used.\n  * Perform market research.\n  * Operate, administer, analyze performance, and serve the functioning of the Sites.\n  * Comply with applicable laws.\n  * Enforce our Terms of Use and contractual agreements.\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, to the extent permitted by the terms of collection, we may request to collect additional personal information.\n\n**Do we share your personal information with third parties?**\n\nPulse Biosciences shares your personal information with third parties only to the extent that you have been informed of the sharing when we collect the personal information. In those instances, you may “opt-out” and direct us not to share your personal information with third parties or you may “opt-in” to allowing us to share your personal information with third parties. Examples of third party sharing of personal information for which we engage include:\n\n  * You consent, or “opt in”, to the collection of your personal information by Pulse Biosciences and you also agree that your information may be shared with third parties.\n  * You have responded to an offer by a third party on the Pulse Biosciences Sites and consent.\n  * You direct us to enter you in a contest.\n  * You direct us to sign you up for a service which is sponsored by one of our partners.\n  * You direct us to provide your information to a company we profiled when you “opt in” for their investor kit.\n  * You otherwise “opt in” to have your information shared with third parties.\n  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process.\n  * We find your actions on our website violate our Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services (and then only to pursue appropriate action).\n  * We transfer your information in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether assets, stock or otherwise), of all or a portion of a business of Pulse Biosciences. If, however, as a result of the business transfer your personal information will be used in a new and different manner, then you will have a choice as to whether to allow this new use.\n\n\n\nIn each of the above situations and similar situations not described above, Pulse Biosciences can no longer update your personal information that has been transferred to such third parties nor opt you out of receiving promotional and/or marketing information from such third parties. Instead, you must contact that third party to update your personal information or to let them know that you no longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about their products, services, or offerings.\n\n**Does Pulse Biosciences use or share aggregated data?**\n\nPulse Biosciences may collect information regarding customer activities on our Sites, or from our products and services, that is aggregated. Aggregated data may include reports on unique visits, repeat visits, page views, referring URL’s, website usage, and other similar statistics. Aggregated data is not personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy and is not associated with your personal information. Aggregated data provides valuable information to Pulse Biosciences about our Sites and users, without identifying individuals. Pulse Biosciences also shares aggregated data with our partners and advertisers.\n\n**How do we use tracking technologies?**\n\nOur Sites use tracking technologies that provide our Sites certain functionalities, our organization certain insights, and our visitors a more valuable interaction. These tracking technologies may include cookies, web beacons, Javascript, etags, or related technologies, some of which are described below.\n\n  * **Cookies**. When you visit our Sites, we may place pieces of code, commonly referred to as “cookies,” or similar technology on your device. A cookie is a piece of programming information contained in a very small text file that is placed in your Internet browser or elsewhere on your hard drive. You can control acceptance of cookies by modifying your Internet browser preferences. You have the ability to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. Please note that, if you choose not to consent to all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or part of our site and may be unable to use those services or engage in activities that require the placement of cookies. We use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website and to help us compile aggregate statistics about usage of our websites.\n  * **Web beacons.** Pulse may also use tracking technologies such as web beacons, to collect information about your visits to our Sites. These are small electronic images embedded in web content or e-mail messages and are ordinarily not visible to users. Like cookies, this tracking technology enables us to track pages and content accessed and viewed by users on the Sites. The use of these technologies also helps us to provide you with a positive experience when you browse our Sites, and it also helps refine our content and personalize your experience.\n  * **Google Analytics.** Google Analytics uses cookies to collect and store data such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of our Sites, the IP address, and the type of operating system used in your device. By downloading and using a browser plugin provided by Google you can choose to opt out of Google Analytics. This plug-in is available at: <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.\n\n\n\nYou can control cookies and tracking tools in a manner that is browser and device specific. How you do so will depend on the type of tracking tool. Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other tracking tools, such as browsers that can be set to reject browser cookies. However, flash cookies, which we may use on our Sites from time to time, cannot be controlled through your browser settings.\n\n  * **Do not track.** Some web browsers may transmit “do not track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates. These features are not uniform, and we may not respond to those “do not track” signals.\n\n\n\nFor more detailed information about cookies in general you may wish to visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).\n\nIf you reside in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we will obtain your consent before storing cookies on your browser. For more specific information about the development of user profiles and the use of targeting/advertising cookies, please see [www.youronlinechoices.eu](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).\n\n### Do we transfer personal information across borders or jurisdictions?\n\nInformation that you provide to us may be transferred to or stored upon servers in the United States, Canada, countries within the European Economic Area, and other countries in which we do business. Some jurisdictions may require an approved transfer basis, mechanism, or agreement, such as the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses. Where such a requirement exists, Pulse Biosciences executes such mechanisms or agreements in advance of a data transfer or transfers. In addition, Pulse Biosciences confirms that required safeguards are followed prior to the initiation of a data transfer or transfers.\n\nTo request more about the transfer mechanisms, means, and safeguards that we use to transfer personal information across jurisdictions, please contact us with your request at privacy@pulsebiosciences.com.\n\n**Security**\n\nThe security of your personal information is important to us and we employ physical, technical, and administrative measures to reduce the risk, loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction of your personal information.

We expect all Pulse Personnel to read and understand the Code and its application to the performance of his or her business responsibilities.\n\nOfficers, managers, and other supervisors are expected to develop in employees a sense of commitment to the letter and spirit of the Code. Supervisors are also expected to ensure that all agents and contractors conform to Code standards when working for or on behalf of Pulse. The compliance environment within each supervisor’s assigned area of responsibility will be a factor in evaluating the quality of that individual’s performance. In addition, any Pulse Personnel who makes an exemplary effort to implement and uphold our legal and ethical standards will be recognized for that effort in his or her performance review.\n\nThis Code covers a wide range of business practices and procedures and is designed to encourage good behavior and promote the standards set forth below. It is intended to advise Pulse Personnel of situations that could possibly result in non-compliance with applicable laws, rules or regulations. While strict compliance by Pulse Personnel with applicable legal requirements is not a new policy, this Code is intended to establish a framework for compliance. This Code does not include all of Pulse’s practices that are designed to achieve compliance with legal and ethical requirements, as Pulse maintains and implements other policies and procedures that are intended to supplement the Code. Pulse Personnel are also subject to other agreements, such as confidentiality and non-competition agreements, and agreements to protect our intellectual property.\n\nFrom time to time we may adopt additional policies and procedures with which Pulse Personnel are expected to comply, if applicable to them. However, it is the responsibility of each person to apply common sense, together with his or her own highest personal ethical standards, in making business decisions where there is no stated guideline in the Code. If a Pulse Personnel is uncertain about a course of action, he or she should consult the Compliance Officer or Pulse’s outside legal counsel (“Counsel”). To the extent that there is any conflict between a national, state or local law, rule or regulation and a policy in this Code, you must comply with the applicable law or regulation; however, if a local custom or policy conflicts with this Code, you must comply with this Code.\n\nIf you have any questions about these conflicts, you should ask Pulse’s Compliance Officer or the Counsel.Action by members of your immediate family, significant others or other persons who live in your household or are dependent on you for their well-being (referred to in the Code as “Family Members”) also may potentially result in ethical issues to the extent that they involve Pulse’s business. For example, acceptance of inappropriate payments or gifts by a Family Member from one of our suppliers could create a conflict of interest and result in a Code violation attributable to you. Consequently, in complying with the Code, you should consider not only your own conduct, but also that of your immediate Family Members, significant others and other persons who live in your household.**YOU SHOULD NOT HESITATE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER ANY CONDUCT MAY VIOLATE THE CODE, VOICE CONCERNS, OR CLARIFY GRAY AREAS. SECTION 14 BELOW DETAILS THE COMPLIANCE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO YOU. IN ADDITION, YOU MUST BE ALERT TO POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE BY OTHERS AND REPORT SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS, WITHOUT FEAR OF ANY FORM OF RETALIATION, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN SECTION**\n\n## 1. Corporate Integrity\n\nIt is the policy of Pulse to promote high standards of integrity by conducting our affairs in an honest and ethical manner. The integrity and reputation of Pulse depends on the honesty, fairness and integrity brought to the job by each person associated with us. Unyielding personal integrity is the foundation of corporate integrity. This responsibility cannot be delegated or assumed by Pulse or any supervisor.\n\n## 2. Conflicts of Interest\n\nYour decisions and actions during your employment with Pulse should be based on the best interests of Pulse, and not personal relationships or benefits. A “conflict of interest” exists when a person’s private interests interfere, or appear to interfere, with the interests of Pulse. You must avoid any private interest that may influence your ability to act in the interests of Pulse or that may make it difficult for you to perform your work objectively. There are many types of conflicts of interest—the following are some common examples:• **Outside Employment.** Pulse strongly discourages outside employment. You may not have outside employment or business dealings with any of the following: (i) any organization that prepares, audits or certifies statements or documents pertinent to our business and financial accounts, and (ii) our current and potential clients, competitors, vendors and suppliers.• Financial Interests. No Pulse Personnel may obtain improper benefits or favors because of his or her position with Pulse. Further, no Pulse Personnel may have a financial interest, either directly or through a Family Member, in a business enterprise if that interest affects the performance of their duties or conflicts with the interests of Pulse.• **Corporate Opportunity.** No person may use Pulse property or information, or his or her position with Pulse, to secure a personal business opportunity or a business opportunity for a Family Member. If you discover a business opportunity through the use of Pulse property, information, or through your position at Pulse, you must first present the opportunity to Pulse before pursuing the opportunity in your individual capacity.•**Service on Boards or Committees.** No Pulse Personnel may serve on a board of directors or trustees or on a committee of any entity whose interests could be expected to conflict with those of Pulse. Pulse Personnel must obtain approval from the Compliance Officer before accepting any such position. Community participation by Pulse Personnel is considered important, however, Pulse also encourages those planning on participating in a charitable or other community organization to consult with the Compliance Officer before taking a service or board position with those types of entities.• **Fees and Honorariums.** With prior approval, Pulse personnel acting in their capacity as a representative of Pulse, may give lectures, conduct seminars, publish articles in books or engage in any other similar activity for which he or she may be paid a fee or honorarium. However, any fees, honorariums or reimbursements must be transferred to Pulse unless written approval is given to retain them.**A conflict of interest will sometimes develop accidentally and is not always easy to identify. If you feel you have a conflict, you must disclose it to the Compliance Officer; further, any potential****conflicts must be identified in connection with your annual review of this Code. Finally, if you observe a situation that you believe to be a conflict, you must report that as well.**\n\n## 3. Insider Trading\n\nPulse Personnel with access to confidential non-public information are not permitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes. Pulse Personnel and their Family Members may not a) trade in stock or other securities while in possession of material nonpublic information or b) pass on material nonpublic information to others without express authorization by Pulse or recommend to others that they trade in stock or other securities based on material non-public information. Violation of this section of the Code and other policies about insider trading may result in a violation of securities laws and potentially exposes Pulse Personnel and Pulse to significant legal fines and imprisonment. All Pulse Personnel should consult the insider trading policy of Pulse and discuss all proposed transactions in Pulse securities with the Compliance Officer or Counsel before they are undertaken.\n\n## 4. Competition and Fair Dealing\n\nPulse seeks to compete fairly and honestly. Pulse Personnel should endeavor to respect the rights of and deal fairly with our customers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No Pulse Personnel should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other intentional unfair-dealing practice.\n\nThe purpose of business entertainment and gifts in a commercial setting is to create good will and sound working relationships, not to gain unfair advantage with customers. The basic principal is that no gift or entertainment may be accepted or provided if it obligates you, or appears to obligate you, to the individual receiving or giving the gift or entertainment. Unless approved in advance by the Compliance Officer, government officials of the United States, the states and municipalities and officials of foreign governments at all levels should not be entertained in any special manner or given any gifts. No gift or entertainment should ever be offered, given, provided or accepted by any Pulse Personnel, Family Member or agent unless it: (1) is not a cash gift, (2) is consistent with customary business practices, (3) is not excessive in value, (4) cannot be construed as a bribe or payoff, and (5) does not violate any laws or regulations.\n\nPlease discuss with the Compliance Officer any gifts or proposed gifts which you are not certain are appropriate to give or receive.\n\nPulse also has strict rules concerning contractual agreements. All terms of our business agreements must be expressed in an approved form of contract or purchase order. Informal commitments to customers are strictly prohibited; these kinds of commitments might be made in a face to face conversation, a telephone call, or an email. Therefore, persons must be careful to use only our approved forms of contracting and not to unintentionally modify a written and approved contract, purchase order or other agreement.\n\n## 5. Respecting Others\n\nPulse is committed to fostering an inclusive workplace where talented people want to stay and develop their careers and advance the scientific area in which we operate. Supporting a diverse, engaged workforce allows us to be successful in building trust, empowering teams, and outperforming our peers and competitors.\n\nPulse requires the Pulse Personnel to act with mutual respect and give professional treatment to others in our workplace. Teamwork is essential to our future, and nothing damages a team more quickly than a lack of mutual respect. Pulse Personnel share a mutual responsibility to keep one another informed of any information that may be important to everyone’s job performance and understanding our business and goals.\n\nPulse recognizes your right to form personal relationships with those you meet in the workplace; however, you are expected to use good judgment to ensure your personal relationships do not negatively affect your job performance or interfere with your or our ability to supervise Pulse Personnel. Favoritism, open displays of affection and making business decisions based on emotions or personal relationships are inappropriate. Situations that involve borrowing money or making loans between Pulse Personnel or involving Family Members must be avoided, unless it is a minimal amount. Similarly, exceptional gifts and entertainment between and among Pulse Personnel can create conflicts and such situations should be avoided. Use your good judgment to act respectfully to one another.\n\n## 6. Discrimination and Harassment\n\nThe diversity of the Pulse’s Personnel is a tremendous asset. Pulse is firmly committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and strictly prohibits any form of harassment in the workplace on the basis of a protected characteristic, such as race, religion, creed, color, sex, age, marital status, national origin, sexual orientation, citizenship status, Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status, medical condition or physical or mental disability. We will promptly take appropriate action to prevent and discipline behavior that violates this policy.Pulse will not tolerate any form of harassment. Harassment can be verbal, physical or include visual images or behaviors that have the effect of creating an offensive atmosphere. It can take many forms and includes pictures, drawings, cartoons, jokes, slurs and offensive remarks, whether delivered verbally, graphically or in electronic media, including email. Offensive behavior and remarks may involve inappropriate remarks about a person’s race, color, sex, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, national origin and other legally protected status. Sexual harassment may include; intentional or unintentional, unwelcome sexual advances with or without touching, coerced sexual acts, requests or demands for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Our policy against harassment applies in all work-related settings and activities, whether on or off company premises. It also extends to Pulse Personnel interactions with our supplies, vendors, clinical participants and other with which Pulse acts. Therefore, think before you speak or act; be careful about what you say and do, where you say or do something, when you say or do something and your objective in something you say or your actions, which might be received as inappropriate or as harassment.\n\n## 7. Health and Safety\n\nPulse strives to provide a safe and healthy work environment. Each employee has responsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all Pulse Personnel by following safety and health rules and practices and reporting accidents, injuries and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.\n\nViolence and threatening behavior are not permitted. Pulse Personnel should report to work in condition to perform their duties, free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. The use of illegal drugs and alcohol in the workplace will not be tolerated.\n\nPulse Personnel many not bring weapons onto Pulse property or to Pulse sponsored events. This includes weapons used for sporting purposes or otherwise, whether or not you have a license to carry or use the weapons. Weapons of any kind have no place in the work environment.\n\nPulse Personnel should be alert to individuals who are on Pulse property without proper authorization. Make sure you observe all physical access rules in your location and report incidents of unauthorized entry to your manager or to security personnel.\n\n## 8. Financial Integrity\n\nAccurate and reliable financial and business records are of critical importance in meeting Pulse’s financial, legal, and business obligations. You must complete all Pulse documents accurately, truthfully, and in a timely manner, including all travel and expense reports. The making of false or misleading entries, records, reports or documentation is strictly prohibited.We are required to disclose accurate and complete information regarding Pulse and the results of our operations. It is Pulse policy to make full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in all documents that Pulse provides to investors, government agencies, and in all other public communications made by Pulse.\n\nDishonest or inaccurate reporting can lead to civil or even criminal liability for you and Pulse and can lead to a loss of public faith in Pulse. Anyone who believes that a violation of law or a failure of compliance has occurred, or is occurring, has a duty to report such information to the General Counsel or to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## 9. Confidentiality\n\nPulse Personnel must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information entrusted to them by Pulse. Confidential information includes all non-public information regarding Pulse, such as our research activities and results of our research and development, our past, current and intended technologies, our patents, our know-how, and the conduct and results of any clinical trials as well as, in the case of human subjects, the particulars about participants in those trials. Confidential information also includes information about our licensors and licensees, our suppliers and our customers. Additionally, you should not discuss the private affairs of your co-workers and their work histories. Our employees are subject to non-competition, confidentiality, inventions and secrets provisions in separate agreements, which must be strictly followed. The obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after employment ends.\n\n## 10. Protection and Proper Use of Pulse Assets\n\nPulse Personnel should endeavor to protect all of our assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on Pulse’s profitability. Pulse equipment should not be used for non-company business, though incidental personal use may be permitted.\n\nThe obligation of Pulse Personnel to protect our assets includes protecting its proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans, engineering and manufacturing ideas, designs, databases, records, salary information and any unpublished financial data and reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information would violate this Code and other policies of Pulse as well as employment related agreements. It could also be illegal. This behavior may result in dismissal and result in civil or criminal penalties.\n\n## 11. Working with Government Personnel\n\nPulse from time to time may work with government agencies in different capacities, such as the approval process for our technologies, licensing of our technologies, patent prosecutions, and government grants. While you must follow the standards of doing what is right with any party with which Pulse has concourse, there are special rules with doing business with a government and its officials.\n\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits giving anything of value (including gifts, meals, entertainments or other benefits), directly or indirectly, to officials and their Family Members of foreign governments or foreign political candidates in order to obtain or retain business. Pulse Personnel are strictly prohibited from making illegal payments to government officials of any country.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. government has a number of laws and regulations regarding business gratuities which may be accepted by U.S. government personnel. The promise, offer or delivery to an official or employee of the U.S. government of a gift, favor (which can include a promise to do something) or other gratuity in violation of these rules would not only violate Pulse policy but could also be a criminal offense. State and local governments, as well as foreign governments, may have similar rules. Pulse’s Counsel can provide guidance to you in this area.\n\nYou also must not accept or present anything if it obligates you, or appears to obligate you, to do something for any government official or other person. Don’t attempt to avoid laws by making payments to or through third parties: be cautious when selecting or dealing with agents and third-party providers. Never make any payment that you do not record on the Pulse books and records. Never issue invoices or charges that are inaccurate, incorrect or unauthorized.\n\nPulse Personnel are expected to cooperate with government officials in investigations and audits. Do not avoid, contravene or otherwise interfere with any government investigation or audit, and do not destroy or alter any Pulse documents (whether electronic or paper) in anticipation of a request for those documents from a government body.\n\n## 12. Waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics\n\nWaivers of this Code will be made only in rare situations. The waiver will ordinarily require the agreement of the Board of Directors of Pulse, and may have to be disclosed to the shareholders. Some waivers may only be permitted with the additional compliance of an applicable law.\n\n## 13. Reporting any Illegal or Unethical Behavior\n\nPulse Personnel are strongly encouraged bring questions or concerns about what to do in a certain situation or if you believe someone is doing, or is about to do, something that violates the law, Pulse policies or this Code. Pulse Personnel should discuss observed illegal or unethical behavior with supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel, such as the Compliance Officer.\n\nPulse Personnel may report a concern or report misconduct in good faith. Pulse has zero tolerance for acts of retaliation by Pulse Personnel against one another. Zero means zero – no one has the authority to justify any act of retaliation. Any Pulse Personnel who engages in retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include dismissal.\n\n## 14. Compliance Procedures\n\nWe must all work to ensure prompt and consistent action against violations of the Code. However, in some situations it is difficult to know if a violation has occurred. Since we cannot anticipate every situation that will arise, it is important that we have a way to approach a new question or problem. These are the steps to keep in mind:• **Make sure you have all the facts.** In order to reach the right solutions, we must be as fully informed as possible.• **Ask yourself:** What specifically am I being asked to do? Does it seem unethical or improper? This will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced with, and the alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense; if something seems unethical or improper, it probably is.•**Clarify your responsibility and role.** In most situations, there is shared responsibility. Are your colleagues informed? It may help to get others involved and discuss the problem.• **Discuss the problem with your supervisor.** This is the basic guidance for all situations. In many cases, your supervisor will be more knowledgeable about the question, and will appreciate being brought into the decision-making process. Remember that it is your supervisor’s responsibility to help solve problems.• **Seek help from Pulse resources.** In the rare case where it may not be appropriate to discuss an issue with your supervisor, or where you do not feel comfortable approaching your supervisor with your question, you may discuss the situation with either the Compliance Officer or Counsel. If you prefer to submit your concerns in writing, address them to:Pulse Biosciences, Inc.Attn: Chief Financial Officer3957 Point Eden WayHayward, California 94545• You may report ethical violations in confidence and without fear of retaliation. If your situation requires that your identity be kept secret, your anonymity will be protected. Pulse does not permit retaliation of any kind against employees for good faith reports of ethical violations.\n\n## 15. Investigations of Suspected Violations\n\nAll reported violations of the Code will be promptly investigated and treated confidentially to the extent reasonably possible. Audits to monitor compliance will be conducted as commercially reasonable and necessary or as required by applicable law or regulation.\n\n## 16. Discipline for Violations\n\nPulse will use every reasonable effort to prevent conduct not in compliance with the Code and to halt any such conduct as soon as possible after its discovery. Subject to applicable law and agreements, Pulse Personnel who violate this Code and other Pulse policies and procedures may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.\n\n## 17. Remember\n\nUltimate responsibility to ensure that we as a company comply with the many laws, regulations and ethical standards affecting our business rests with each of us. You must become familiar with and conduct yourself strictly in compliance with those laws, regulations and standards and Pulse’s policies and guidelines pertaining to them.\n"
