At the General Meeting, Shareholders approved the issue of 2,500,000 Director Options\n(exercisable at $0.04 expiring 3 years from the date of issue) to each of Philip Otley, Philip\nMarsland and Dr John Tarrant, and 5,000,000 incentive Options (exercisable at $0.04\nexpiring 3 years from the date of issue) to Ronan Dunne.\n4.

This assumes all New Options offered pursuant to this Prospectus are issued and exercised\ninto Shares while no other convertible securities are converted into Shares.\n1.7 Effect on Control\nThere will be no change to any Shareholder’s voting power as a result of the\nissue of the New Options. Where New Options are exercised into Shares, the\n3\nReplacement prospectus which replaces the prospectus dated 14 June 2023.\nvoting power of the Shareholders who exercise the New Options will increase.\nThe likelihood of New Options being exercised is dependent on the price of\nShares from time to time until the New Options expire.\n1.8 Risk Factors\nProspective investors should be aware that subscribing for the New Options\ninvolves a number of risks and an investment in the Company should be\nconsidered as highly speculative. The future performance of the Company and\nthe value of the Securities may be influenced by a range of factors, many of\nwhich are largely beyond the control of the Company and the Directors. The key\nrisks associated with the Company’s business, the industry in which it operates\nand general risks applicable to all investments in listed securities and financial\nmarkets generally are set out in Section 4.\n1.9 Lead Manager\nThe Company has not appointed a lead manager to the Offers.\n1.10 Underwriting\nThe Offers are fully underwritten by Balmain Resources Pty Ltd (Underwriter), an\nentity associated with Dr John Tarrant, a Director of the Company.

RISK FACTORS\n4.1 Introduction\nThe New Options offered under this Prospectus should be considered as highly\nspeculative and an investment in the Company is not risk free.\nThe Directors strongly recommend that prospective investors consider the risk\nfactors set out in this Section 4, together with all other information contained in\nthis Prospectus.\nThe future performance of the Company and the value of the Securities may be\ninfluenced by a range of factors, many of which are largely beyond the control\nof the Company and the Directors. The key risks associated with the Company’s\nbusiness, the industry in which it operates and general risks applicable to all\ninvestments in listed securities and financial markets generally are described\nbelow.\nThe risks factors set out in this Section 4, or other risk factors not specifically\nreferred to, may have a materially adverse impact on the performance of the\nCompany and the value of the New Options. This Section 4 is not intended to\nprovide an exhaustive list of the risk factors to which the Company is exposed.\nBefore determining whether to invest in the Company you should ensure that\nyou have a sufficient understanding of the risks described in this Section 4 and all\nof the other information set out in this Prospectus and consider whether an\ninvestment in the Company is suitable for you, taking into account your\nobjectives, financial situation and needs.\nIf you do not understand any matters contained in this Prospectus or have any\nqueries about whether to invest in the Company, you should consult your\naccountant, financial adviser, stockbroker, lawyer or other professional adviser.\n4.2 Company specific\nRisk Category Risk\nGoing The Company’s Interim Financial Report for the half year\nconcern risk ended 31 December 2022 includes a note on the financial\ncondition of the Company and the possible existence of a\nmaterial uncertainty about the Company’s ability to continue\nas a going concern.\nAs disclosed in the Financial Report, the Company incurred a\nloss of $968,308 and a net cash outflow from operating\nactivities of $144,273 and is in a net liability position of $654,359\nat period end. These conditions indicate the existence of a\nmaterial uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about\nthe Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The\nability of the Company to continue as a going concern is\ndependent on securing additional funding through capital\nraising activities and the securing of material revenue\ngenerating contracts to continue its operational and\nmarketing activities.\nThe Directors are satisfied they will be able to raise additional\nworking capital as required and thus it is appropriate to\nprepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.\n16\nReplacement prospectus which replaces the prospectus dated 14 June 2023.\nRisk Category Risk\nAdditional The Company’s current business will require ongoing\nrequirements expenditures. The Company may seek to raise further funds\nfor capital through equity or debt financing, joint ventures, production\nsharing arrangements or other means. There can be no\nassurance that additional finance will be available when\nneeded or, if available, the terms of the financing might not\nbe favourable to the Company and might involve substantial\ndilution to Shareholders.\nIf the Company is unable to source additional capital after\nexhaustion of existing working capital, there can be no\nassurance that the Company will have sufficient capital to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nAny additional equity financing would most likely be dilutive\nto the Company’s existing Shareholders and any debt\nfinancing if available, may involve restrictive covenants,\nwhich may limit the Company’s business strategy. The\nCompany’s failure to raise capital if and when needed could\ndelay or suspend the Company’s business strategy and could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s activities.\nThe Company, in the ordinary course of its operations and\ndevelopments, may be required to issue financial assurances,\nparticularly insurances and bond/bank guarantee instruments\nto secure statutory and environmental performance\nundertakings and commercial arrangements. The Company’s\nability to provide such assurances is subject to external\nfinancial and credit market assessments, and its own financial\nposition.\nLoan agreements and other financing rearrangements such\nas debt facilities, convertible note issue and finance leases\n(and any related guarantee and security) that may be\nentered into by the Company may contain covenants,\nundertakings and other provisions which, if breached, may\nentitle lenders to accelerate repayment of loans and there is\nno assurance that the Company would be able to repay such\nloans in the event of an acceleration. Enforcement of any\nsecurity granted by the Company or default under a finance\nlease could also result in the loss of assets.\nThe Company is exposed to risks associated with its financial\ninstruments (consisting of cash, receivables, accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities due to third parties from time\nto time). This includes the risk that a third party to a financial\ninstrument fails to meet its contractual obligations; the risk that\nthe Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations\nas they fall due; and the risk that market prices may vary\nwhich will affect the Company’s income.\nClimate Risk There are a number of climate-related factors that may affect\nthe operations and proposed activities of the Company. The\nclimate change risks particularly attributable to the Company\ninclude:\n(a) the emergence of new or expanded regulations\nassociated with the transitioning to a lower-carbon\neconomy and market changes related to climate\n17\nReplacement prospectus which replaces the prospectus dated 14 June 2023.\nRisk Category Risk\nchange mitigation. The Company may be impacted\nby changes to local or international compliance\nregulations related to climate change mitigation\nefforts, or by specific taxation or penalties for carbon\nemissions or environmental damage. These examples\nsit amongst an array of possible restraints on industry\nthat may further impact the Company and its\nprofitability. While the Company will endeavour to\nmanage these risks and limit any consequential\nimpacts, there can be no guarantee that the\nCompany will not be impacted by these\noccurrences; and\n(b) climate change may cause certain physical and\nenvironmental risks that cannot be predicted by the\nCompany, including events such as increased\nseverity of weather patterns and incidence of\nextreme weather events and longer-term physical\nrisks such as shifting climate patterns. All these risks\nassociated with climate change may significantly\nchange the industry in which the Company operates.\nCoronavirus The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is\n(COVID 19) impacting global economic markets. The nature and extent\nof the effect of the outbreak on the performance of the\nCompany remains unknown. The Company’s Share price may\nbe adversely affected in the short to medium term by the\neconomic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Further, any\ngovernmental or industry measures taken in response to\nCOVID-19 may adversely impact the Company’s operations\nand are likely to be beyond the control of the Company.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also give rise to issues, delays or\nrestrictions in product processing and packaging and the\nCompany's ability to deliver products to customers, which\nmay result in cost increases or adverse impacts on sales. In\naddition, the effects of COVID-19 on the Company's Share\nprice and global financial markets generally may also affect\nthe Company's ability to raise equity or debt or require the\nCompany to issue capital at a discount, which may in turn\ncause dilution to Shareholders or the COVID-19 pandemic\nmay also give rise to issues, delays or restrictions in relation to\nland access and the Company's ability to freely move people\nand equipment to and from exploration projects may cause\ndelays or cost increases. The effects of COVID -19 on the\nCompany's Share price and global financial markets\ngenerally may also affect the Company's ability to raise\nequity or debt or require the Company to issue capital at a\ndiscount, which may in turn cause dilution to Shareholders.\nThe Directors are monitoring the situation closely and have\nconsidered the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s\nbusiness and financial performance. However, the situation is\ncontinually evolving, and the consequences are therefore\ninevitably uncertain. In compliance with its continuous\ndisclosure obligations, the Company will continue to update\nthe market in regard to the impact of COVID-19 on its\n18\nReplacement prospectus which replaces the prospectus dated 14 June 2023.\nRisk Category Risk\nrevenue channels and any adverse impact on the Company.\nIf any of these impacts appear material prior to close of the\nOffer, the Company will notify investors under a\nsupplementary prospectus.\nRelated Party The Company has a number of key contractual relationships\nRisk with related parties. If these relationships breakdown and the\nrelated party agreements are terminated, there is a risk that\nthe Company may not be able to find a satisfactory\nreplacement.\nFurther, the operations of the Company will require\ninvolvement of related parties and other third parties. With\nrespect to these persons and despite applying best practice\nin terms of pre-contracting due diligence, the Company is\nunable to completely avoid the risk of:\n(a) financial failure or default by a participant in any\nagreement to which the Company may become a\nparty; and/or\n(b) insolvency, default on performance or delivery by\nany operators, contractors or service providers.\nThere is also a risk that where the Company has engaged a\ncontractor who is a related party, the contract between the\ncontractor and the Company may terminate for reasons\noutside of the control of the Company. This may then result in\nthe termination of the contract between the Company and\nthe contractor and the impact the Company’s position,\nperformance and reputation.\nRelationships the Company is unable to a) maintain good relationship with\nwith service its wholesale telecommunications service providers or b)\nproviders develop and grow its relationships with additional providers, its\nbusiness will suffer.\nThe Company’s Corona, World Phone®, World Message™,\nWorld Secure™, World Wi-Fi™, World Voicemail™ and\nCogVoice™ services and platforms rely on integration with\ncertain capabilities of wholesale telecommunications service\nproviders and aggregators using publicly available\napplication programming interfaces (APIs). In general, the\nCompany relies on the fact that such providers continue to\nallow the Company access to their APIs to enable these\nservice platform integrations. To date, the Company has not\nrelied on long-term written contracts to govern its relationship\nwith such wholesale providers. Instead, the Company is\nsubject to the standard terms and conditions for application\ndevelopers who are using such APIs, which govern generally\nthe terms of use of access to, and use of, the wholesale\ntelecommunications service providers’ platforms, and which\nare subject to change by these providers from time to time.\nAny deterioration in the Company’s relationship with any such\nwholesale service provider could harm its business and\nadversely affect its operating results.\n19\nReplacement prospectus which replaces the prospectus dated 14 June 2023.\nRisk Category Risk\nCustomer The Company’s business model is based on recurring revenue\nservice risk arising from the provision of service and from usage. Poor\ncustomer service experiences may result if the Company loses\nkey customer service personnel, fails to provide adequate\ntraining and resources for customer service personnel or there\nis a disruption to monitoring and account management\nsystems utilised by customer service personnel. Poor\nexperiences may result in the loss of customers, adverse\npublicity, litigation, regulatory enquiries and customers\nreducing the use of the Company's products or services. If any\nof these occur, it may adversely impact the Company's\nrevenues.\nThere may also be situations in the consumer channel where\nthe end customer service is provided by the Partner or their\nClient. In such instances, the Company is not able to control\nthe provision of service, the service levels offered, the service\nsystems used, the training of the service personnel or the\nservice support material. Poor experiences may result in the\nloss of Partners, Partner’s Clients or end customers, adverse\npublicity, litigation, regulatory enquiries and customers\nreducing the use of the Company's products or services. If any\nof these occur, it may adversely impact the Company's\nrevenues.\n4.3 Industry specific\nRisk Category Risk\nData loss, theft The Company is reliant on the security of its network\nor corruption environment, vendor environments and websites. Breaches of\nrisks security including hacking, denial of service attacks, malicious\nsoftware use, internal IP theft, data theft or other external or\ninternal security threats could put the integrity and privacy of\ncustomers’ data and business systems used by the Company\nat risk which could impact technology operations and\nultimately customer satisfaction with the Company’s products,\nleading to lost contracts and Company revenue. The impact\nof loss or leakage of customer or business data could include\ncosts for potential service disruptions, litigation and brand\ndamage which may potentially have a material adverse\nimpact on the Company's reputation as well as its profitability.\nFurthermore, any such historical and public security breaches\ncould impact the Company’s ability to acquire future\ncustomers and revenue. In addition, substantial costs may be\nincurred in order to prevent the occurrence of future security\nbreaches.\nWhilst the Company has established risk management systems\nto prevent cyber-attacks and any potential data security\nbreaches, including firewalls, encryption of customer data\n(storage and transmission) and a privacy policy, there are\ninherent limitations on such systems, including the possibility\nthat certain risks have not been identified. There can be no\nguarantee that the measures taken by the Company will be\nsufficient to detect or prevent data security breaches.\n20\nReplacement prospectus which replaces the prospectus dated 14 June 2023.\nRisk Category Risk\nUncertainty of The Company is in the commercialisation stage for its virtual\nfuture mobile services platform, Corona® and Apps, World Phone®,\nprofitability World MessageTM, World SecureTM, World Wi-FiTM and World\nVoicemailTM. Regarding the Company’s offerings, the\nCompany is in discussions with a number of potential\ncustomers, however there is no guarantee these discussions\nwill lead to commercial sales. The Company’s future\nprofitability will be impacted by its ability to successfully\ndeliver a high level of service to any future potential\ncustomers, its ability to execute its development and growth\nstrategies, economic conditions in the markets in which it\noperates, competitive factors and regulatory developments.\nAccordingly, the extent of future profits, if any, and the time\nrequired to achieve a sustained profitability are uncertain.\nMoreover, the level of such profitability cannot be predicted.\nNew product The Company is reliant upon certain technologies and upon\ndevelopment the successful commercialisation of these technologies. There\nand is a risk that as marketable technologies continue to develop\ntechnology in the communications industry there may be certain product\nrisk developments that supersede, and render obsolete, the\nproducts and services of the Company. This would adversely\naffect the profitability of the Company and likely value of the\nSecurities.\nProtection of The Company is the assignee for five patent families, four of\nintellectual which have been granted in Australia. Two of these have also\nproperty rights been granted in USA and one in Europe and corresponding\napplications are pending for the remainder in the US and EU\nregions. The fifth family is pending in Australia, USA and\nEurope. Objections have been raised in relation to this\nmobility patent application family based on the novelty and\ninventive step requirements, citing an existing patent owned\nby a third party. If the Company is not able to overcome\nthese objections, there is a risk that the patent may not\nultimately be granted. The prospect of attaining patent\nprotection for products and the technology such as those\nproposed to be used in the Company business is highly\nuncertain and involves complex and continually evolving\nfactual and legal questions. These include legislative and\njudicial changes, or changes in the examination guidelines of\ngovernmental patent offices, which may negatively affect\nthe Company‘s ability to obtain patents for its products and\ntechnologies. In addition, the scope of patent applications\ncan be significantly reduced during prosecution of the patent\napplications, with the result that the scope of protection in the\nissued patent may be significantly less than the scope of\nprotection initially sought by the Company. As a result, the\nCompany's patent application may not proceed to an issued\npatent and, if issued, may not be of commercial benefit to\nthe Company, or may not afford the Company adequate\nprotection from competing products. Alternatively, in\nmodifying the relevant claims to address the objections, there\nis a risk of scope of protection in the issued patent being\nsignificantly less than the scope of protection sought by the\n21\nReplacement prospectus which replaces the prospectus dated 14 June 2023.\nRisk Category Risk\nCompany.\nThe Company may also be forced to litigate to enforce or\ndefend its intellectual property rights, including any granted\npatents, against infringement and unauthorised use by\ncompetitors, and to protect its trade secrets. In so doing, the\nCompany may place its intellectual property at risk of being\ninvalidated, unenforceable, limited or narrowed in scope.\n4.4 General risks\nRisk Category Risk\nEconomic General economic conditions, movements in interest and\ninflation rates and currency exchange rates may have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s activities, as well as on its\nability to fund those activities.\nMarket Share market conditions may affect the value of the\nconditions Company’s quoted securities regardless of the Company’s\noperating performance. Share market conditions are\naffected by many factors such as:\n(a) general economic outlook;\n(b) introduction of tax reform or other new legislation;\n(c) interest rates and inflation rates;\n(d) changes in investor sentiment toward particular\nmarket sectors;\n(e) the demand for, and supply of, capital; and\n(f) terrorism or other hostilities.\nIn addition, the extent of the effects of COVID-19 is at this\nstage uncertain and continuing to evolve. The COVID-19\npandemic is having, and is expected to continue to have, a\nsignificant influence on the volatility of equity markets\ngenerally and may continue to impact and influence the\nvalue of the Company’s quoted securities.\nLitigation risks The Company is exposed to possible litigation risks including\nintellectual property claims, contractual disputes,\noccupational health and safety claims and employee claims.\nFurther, the Company may be involved in disputes with other\nparties in the future which may result in litigation. Any such\nclaim or dispute if proven, may impact adversely on the\nCompany’s operations, financial performance and financial\nposition. The Company is not currently engaged in any\nlitigation.\nDividends Any future determination as to the payment of dividends by\nthe Company will be at the discretion of the Directors and will\ndepend on the financial condition of the Company, future\ncapital requirements and general business and other factors\nconsidered relevant by the Directors.

The patent\napplications for one of these families were discontinued in 2019. Currently, four\npatent families have been granted in Australia without any existing or pending\nobjections. These four patents have also been approved in the USA, while\nthree have been approved in Europe. A new patent application for a\ndifferent family was submitted in early March 2023, for which no objections\nhave been lodged.\nObtaining patent protection for products and technologies, such as those\nproposed for use in the Company's business, is a complex and uncertain\nprocess due to evolving factual and legal matters. These include possible\nlegislative and judicial changes or alterations to the examination guidelines\nof governmental patent offices. Such changes could detrimentally affect the\ncompany's ability to secure patents for its products and technologies. The\nscope of patent applications can also be considerably diminished during\nprosecution, potentially resulting in a narrower scope of protection than\ninitially sought.\nFurther, the Company's existing application might not become an issued\npatent if objections are raised and not successfully addressed. Moreover,\neven if issued, it may not provide significant commercial benefits or\nadequately protect against competition.\nAdditionally, the Company might need to enforce or defend its intellectual\nproperty rights, including any granted patents, against potential infringement\nor unauthorised use by competitors and safeguard its trade secrets. In doing\nso, there's a risk of its intellectual property being invalidated, deemed\nunenforceable, limited, or narrowed in scope.\n5 DIRECTORS’ AUTHORISATION\nThis Supplementary Prospectus is issued by the Company and its issue has\nbeen authorised by a resolution of the Directors.\nIn accordance with section 720 of the Corporations Act, each Director has\nconsented to the lodgement of this Supplementary Prospectus with ASIC.\nPaul Ostergaard\nManaging Director\nFor and on behalf\nNorwood Systems Limited\nThis Supplementary Prospectus is intended to be read together with the replacement prospectus dated 15 June 2023.\n6\nylno\nesu\nlanosrep\nroF"

A copy of the Prospectus is available on the Company’s website,\nwww.norwoodsystems.com. Balmain Resources Pty Ltd (ACN 076 375 203) (Balmain\nResources) has been appointed as the underwriter to the offer.\nThe offers will be made under, or accompanied by, a copy of the Prospectus. Any\nrecipient of this TMD should carefully read and consider the Prospectus in full and consult\ntheir professional adviser if they have any questions regarding the contents of the\nProspectus. Any recipient of this TMD who wants to acquire Options under the offers will\nneed to complete the application form that will be in, or will accompany, the Prospectus.\nThere is no cooling off period in respect of the issue of the Options. This TMD is not a\ndisclosure document for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and therefore\nhas not been lodged, and does not require lodgement, with the Australian Securities and\nInvestments Commission (ASIC).\nThis TMD does not take into account what you currently have, or what you want and need,\nfor your financial future. It is important for you to consider these matters and read the\nProspectus before you make an investment decision. The Company is not licensed to\nprovide financial product advice in relation to the Options.\n1. TARGET MARKET\nFactor Target market\nInvestment The Company expects that an investment in Options will\nObjective be suitable to investors who wish to gain exposure to\nequities in a small tech Company listed on the Australian\nSecurities Exchange (ASX).\nInvestment The target market of investors will take a short to\nTimeframe medium term outlook on their investment. Investors with\na short-term outlook for their investment will benefit from\nan ability to exercise Options and trade the underlying\nShares issued on exercise should the Option exercise\nprice of the Options be lower than the trading price of\nShares. Investors with a medium-term outlook will\nbenefit from an ability to exercise Options within the\ntwo-year term of the Options and increase their\nshareholding and exposure to the potential upside in\nthe Company’s Shares into the future.\nGiven the need to pay the exercise price in order to\nacquire shares, Investors in the target market are in a\n1\nfinancial position that is sufficient for them to invest their\nfunds on exercise the Options over a two and a half\nyear time horizon, during which their ability to liquidate\ntheir Options in the Company may be limited by a lack\nof liquidity in the Options and by the trading price of\nshares.\nInvestment Metrics While the Company does not have an established\neligibility framework for investors based on metrics such\nas age, expected return or volatility, it is expected that\nthe target market of investors will be able to withstand\npotential fluctuations in the value of their investment.\nThe Options offer no guaranteed income or capital\nprotection.\nRisk The Company considers that an investment in the\nOptions is highly speculative, such that an investment in\nthe Company is not appropriate for an investor who\nwould not be able to bear a loss of some or all of the\ninvestment. Investors should also have a sufficient level\nof financial literacy and resources (either alone or in\nconjunction with an appropriate adviser) to understand\nand appreciate the risks of investing in Options as an\nasset class generally and the more specific risks of\ninvesting in an Australian listed tech company.\n2. DISTRIBUTION CONDITIONS\nThe offers of Options under the Prospectus is being made to those shareholders\nand optionholders (as applicable) in the Company registered at the record dates\nspecified in the Prospectus (Eligible Shareholders).\nAny entitlement under the Entitlement Offer not taken up under the offers will form\na shortfall offer (Shortfall Offer). Eligible Shareholders may also subscribe for\nOptions above their entitlement under the Shortfall Offer.\nThe Prospectus will include jurisdictional conditions on eligibility. The Company will\nalso include on its web landing page for the offers of Options a copy of this TMD\nand require that retail clients confirm that they meet the eligibility criteria of the\nexpected target market outlined in this TMD before they apply for Options.\nThe Company considers that these distribution conditions will ensure that persons\nwho invest in Options fall within the target market in circumstances where personal\nadvice is not being provided to those persons by the Company.\n3. REVIEW TRIGGERS\nThe Options are being offered for a limited offer period set out in the Prospectus,\nafter the conclusion of which the Options will no longer be available for\ninvestment by way of issue. It follows that the TMD will only apply in the period\nbetween the commencement of the offers of the Options and the issue of the\nOptions shortly after the close of the offers (Offer Period).\n2\nTo allow the Company to determine whether circumstances exist that indicate\nthis TMD is no longer appropriate to the Options and should be reviewed, the\nfollowing review triggers apply for the Offer Period:\n(a) a new offer of Options that requires preparation of a disclosure document\nis made after completion of the Offer Period;\n(b) any event or circumstance that would materially change a factor taken\ninto account in making this TMD;\n(c) the existence of a significant dealing of the Options that is not consistent\nwith this TMD.

We are\ndeveloping a robust pipeline of AI-driven applications that address real-world problems, keeping Norwood\nat the forefront of industry innovation and positively impacting end-users around the world.”\nSales and Commercialisation Activities\nCogVoice: Powering Cognitive Voice Applications for Communications Service Providers\nNorwood’s CogVoice platform leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to provide exceptional natural\nlanguage fluidity and responsiveness, making customer or caller engagement more streamlined and effective.\nWith its low-cost implementation, best-in-class latency, and 4G/5G compatibility, CogVoice is the ideal solution\nfor Communications Service Providers (CSPs) of all sizes.\nCogVoice’s Scalable Service Architecture\nIn March 2022, Norwood announced a new global technology and services partnership with Infosys Limited, a\nleader in next-generation digital services and consulting. As part of this collaboration, Norwood secured a\ncontract to develop and deliver an advanced CogVoice-powered Proof of Concept (PoC) communications\nsolution for a major Tier-1 Australian CSP.\nylno\nesu\nlanosrep\nroF\nFollowing the successful completion of the PoC solution, Norwood and the CSP in question have made\nsignificant progress during the March 2023 quarter on contract negotiations for a large-scale production\ndeployment. Further updates on this development are anticipated in the current quarter.\nAdditionally, Norwood secured a paid Proof-of-Value CogVoice project with a North American CSP during the\nMarch 2023 quarter. This project is in its early stages and is anticipated to be completed over the coming\nquarters.\nMWC 2023: Building on the Momentum\nThe recent market outreach at MWC 2023 in Barcelona at the end of February 2023 marked a significant\nmilestone for Norwood, generating considerable interest in the CogVoice platform and its associated\napplications. Norwood's CEO Paul Ostergaard, strategic adviser Ronan Dunne, and board members Philip Otley\nand Phil Marsland engaged in productive meetings with over two dozen operators, hyperscalers, and analysts,\nproviding valuable feedback and opening doors for potential partnerships and collaborations in the cognitive\nvoice CSP services space.\nMoving forward from MWC 2023, the connections and relationships established during the event will play a\ncrucial role in the Company's ongoing efforts to strengthen Norwood's market position and deliver value for its\nstakeholders. The positive response to CogVoice highlights a strong potential market demand for the\ndownstream applications enabled by the platform, and the Norwood team is focused on capitalising on the\nopportunities generated at the event.\nCogVoice Call Screener: Delivering AI-Powered Call Protection\nBuilding on the work completed during prior quarters, Norwood recently launched its CogVoice Call Screener\napplication on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner Ecosystem Portal3. This AI-powered solution screens\nincoming calls from unknown callers at the voice interface level, identifying and filtering out scam or spam\ncallers and keeping genuine callers connected.\nFollowing considerable effort and engagement, Norwood has secured the AWS Foundational Technical Review\n(FTR) approval for the CogVoice Call Screener application. This signifies Norwood’s dedication to providing top-\nquality solutions that adhere to AWS best practices, architecture, operations, and security standards.\nAttaining FTR approval underscores Norwood’s expertise in delivering high-quality AWS-based solutions,\nenhancing the Company’s competitive edge on the AWS Partner Ecosystem Portal. This achievement is\nexpected to boost Norwood’s visibility and credibility within the AWS ecosystem, opening doors to new\nbusiness opportunities and fostering a stronger relationship with AWS4.\nPremium Visual Voicemail: Continued Success with Spark NZ\nNorwood’s long-standing partnership with Spark NZ remains strong, following the Company signing a variation\nto its premium visual voicemail service agreement in October 2022. The updated agreement extends the\ncontracted terms for premium visual voicemail services and maintenance charges, securing a stable revenue\nstream for Norwood.\nDuring the March 2023 quarter, Norwood successfully progressed Purchase Orders from Spark NZ, totalling\napproximately NZD$682,000 for end-user subscription and maintenance services for FY2023. This ongoing\nrelationship demonstrates Norwood’s commitment to providing exceptional service and solutions to its clients\nand partners.\n3 See: https://partners.amazonaws.com/partners/0018W000025p7rKQAQ/Norwood%20Systems\n4 The Company is anticipating to have CogVoice Call Screener also listed on the AWS Marketplace in due course,\ncomplementary to its presence on the AWS Partner Ecosystem Portal.\nylno\nesu\nlanosrep\nroF\nProduct and Service Development Activities\nCogVoice Call Screener: Showcasing Norwood’s Engineering Expertise with Advanced AI\nNorwood’s focus on product development and innovation over the past 18 months led to the recent post-\nquarter launch of the CogVoice Call Screener Application on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner\nEcosystem Portal and its gaining FTR approval, as noted above.\nCogVoice Call Screener utilises state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) AI technologies to analyse\nincoming calls from unknown numbers at the voice interface level. In real-time, the system efficiently detects\nand distinguishes between regular, scam, and spam calls, ensuring genuine “good actor” callers remain\nconnected.\nDeveloping and testing the screening models presented several engineering challenges. The team had to\nensure the models could adapt to the highly dynamic nature of telecommunications networks, processing call\ndata quickly and accurately. Moreover, the models needed to be robust enough to account for various\naccents, dialects, and languages while maintaining a low false positive rate.\nThrough extensive research, development, and rigorous testing, Norwood’s engineers successfully addressed\nthese challenges, creating a highly effective and completely novel call screening solution for CSPs that\nleverages the latest start-of-the-art advanced LLM technologies.\nCogVoice Call Screener is the first of a number of applications in Norwood’s pipeline, focused on solving real\nend-customer problems, arising from Norwood’s multi-year R&D investment in the CogVoice platform.\nBelow is a white-label (generic) realisation of the CogVoice Call Screener user experience for the end-user\nsubscriber, as used by certain Proof-of-Concept deployments, highlighting how CogVoice Call Screener can\nscreen the incoming calls in real-time for a subscriber, and highlighting how the subscriber can jump into a call\nat any time during the screening process.\nCogVoice Call Screener User Experience (white-label PoC realisation)\nNew Patent Filing: Advanced AI-Driven “Conversation System”\nLate in the March 2023 quarter, Norwood filed a patent for key inventions pertaining to the Company’s real-\ntime screening notification system and its Elastic Intent processing, showcasing Norwood’s commitment to\ninnovation in Conversational AI applications.\nNorwood’s ground-breaking Elastic Intent technology enhances the capabilities of chatbots, virtual assistants,\nand customer service platforms, enabling them to handle complex, multi-turn conversations with greater ease\nylno\nesu\nlanosrep\nroF\nand fluency. By intelligently adapting to the complexity and context of the conversation, Norwood’s advanced\nAI-driven “Conversation System” (as realised by CogVoice) provides a more seamless and natural user\nexperience.\nSome of the key benefits of Norwood’s now patent pending CogVoice platform include:\n1. Enhanced user experiences: The real-time screening notification system and Elastic Intent processing\nenable more natural and engaging interactions between users and machines, resulting in increased\nuser satisfaction and loyalty.\n2. Improved handling of complex conversations: The system’s ability to predict user intent and generate\ncontextually appropriate responses allows it to effectively manage multi-turn conversations, providing\na more accurate and personalised interaction.\n3. Intellectual property protection: The patent application provides a safeguard for Norwood’s\ninnovative CogVoice platform, positioning the Company as a leader in the Conversational AI CSP\napplication market and supporting Norwood’s competitive advantage.\nElastic Intent – Core Operating Model\nInnovation and Industry Relationships: Early Beta Access to the OpenAI GPT-4 APIs\nNorwood has been granted early access to the core GPT-4 APIs by OpenAI, an opportunity the Company\nunderstands has been extended to only selected organisations and individuals to date. Early access to this\npowerful technology helps Norwood to stay ahead in developing and integrating advanced and compelling\napplications, fully benefitting from the rapid pace of innovation in OpenAI’s most advanced GPT platform.\nGiven the rate of change in the AI industry generally, the Norwood team is working tirelessly to exploit the\nbenefits of early access to the GPT-4 APIs. This builds upon the early access granted to Norwood for OpenAI’s\nGPT-3 APIs in early 2021, well before their public release and long before the appearance of ChatGPT.\nOpenAI’s state-of-the-art technology continues to make a significant global impact, and Norwood is proud to\nbe at the forefront of innovators utilizing these powerful tools to drive progress and enhance user experiences\nin the conversational AI application market.\nylno\nesu\nlanosrep\nroF\nCorporate Activities\nWorking Capital Facility Secured\nOn 28 February 2023, Norwood announced that it had entered into an agreement providing access to a\nworking capital facility of up to $300,000, available in three separate tranches.\nThe funds will allow Norwood the flexibility to pursue multiple growth opportunities previously outlined,\nfollowing an intensive period of research and development for the Company’s CogVoice platform and\nassociated application offerings, such as CogVoice Call Screener.\nThe loan has been advanced by Balmain Resources Pty Ltd, a company that director Dr John Tarrant controls.\nThe Board has assessed the transaction as being arm’s length as the terms are better for the Company than\nprevailing market rates. Norwood has drawn down the full amount available under the facility.\nThe interest rate will accrue daily from the draw down date and will be calculated on the daily amount\noutstanding at a rate of 9.75% and will be payable on the repayment date of 30 June 2023. If the loan is not\nrepaid by the repayment date, then there will be a default of an additional interest rate of 2% above the 9.75%\nuntil such time as the loan and all outstanding monies have been repaid.

Unlike the market for CSP voicemail\nplatforms, which can be characterised as a mature market segment for CSPs, cognitive voice service platforms represent a\nbrand-new opportunity for CSPs to refresh, revitalise and remonetise their ageing, largely undifferentiated voice offerings.\nNorwood’s motivation for investing in cognitive voice service offerings was to drive further innovation and demand from CSPs,\nproviding the impetus for shorter, more profitable sales cycles for its CSP service offerings. Gratifyingly, this strategy is now\nstarting to pay off for the Company and the entire business is looking forward to a highly active FY23, largely focused on the\nnew frontier of CSP-hosted cognitive voice services and applications, whilst continuing to maintain and further develop its\nhistorical voicemail service offerings.\nIn FY22, Norwood further bolstered its relationship with Spark NZ, a core Norwood customer for its CSP voicemail platform,\nwith further updates and improvements being added to the Spark Voicemail platform supplied by Norwood over the course of\nthe fiscal year.\nAs a result, the Company saw positive progress in relation to this long-standing Spark NZ contract, securing several purchase\norders amounting to NZD$682,000 received from Spark NZ post-FY22 end. This is an increase on the purchase orders received\nfrom Spark NZ during FY22 and lays a solid cornerstone for further growth in FY23.\nThe Infosys partnership established in FY22 is continuing to flourish beyond the two contracts Norwood has won through this\nrelationship, with both companies are actively pursuing potential future joint commercial activities together. Mid-FY22 the\nCompany also renewed its board in line with the positive evolution of our strategic direction, with the three new non-executive\nboard members taking a proactive role in helping to drive the Company to a much higher level of performance. I have been\ndelighted with the contributions made by the new members of the board thus far and am confident their contributions will\nhave a substantial impact on the company over the coming FY23.\nResults\nOur significant investment in technology and marketing, as well as our strong financial discipline, translated into improved\nfinancial performance. Net of R&D tax rebates and JobKeeper payments, Norwood continued to improve its core operating\nmetrics for the year ending 30 June 2022 with revenue increasing 15% to approximately $922,000 and our net loss after tax\nnarrowing 9% to $1.08 million. Our net loss after tax has improved consistently year on year since FY19 where the net loss\namounted to $3.02 million and Norwood anticipates this positive trajectory will continue in FY23 and beyond.\nWith an enhanced focus on prudent cost control emerging we are positioned extremely well to translate our expanded revenue\nbase into increased earnings.\nDuring the year, the Company successfully completed placements of 61,505,971 ordinary shares to raise $960,590. Norwood\nalso issued convertible notes to Managing Director, Paul Ostergaard, in May 2021 and raising a further $100,000 from his\npersonal investment in the Company.\nFurther to this, Norwood received an Australian Tax Office (ATO) Research and Development (R&D) Grant of $390,000 in\nNovember 2021. This coupled with constant prudent cash control and increasing customer cash receipts, gives the Board\nconfidence that the short-term capital requirements of the Company are in hand.\nWorld Voicemail\nAfter launching World Voicemail in FY19, throughout FY20 and FY21 Norwood continued to develop and enhance the platform\nto further strengthen the Company’s position to target the CSP market for legacy voicemail service replacements.\nNorwood completed a major milestone during FY22 with the release of Version 4 of its industry-leading World Voicemail\nplatform. This release incorporated some of the world’s most advanced voice recognition and transcription software. With a\nplethora of other features, World Voicemail’s advanced transcription capability makes it arguably the world’s best visual\nvoicemail platform available on the market today for CSPs interested in upgrading their ageing non-visual voicemail platforms,\nor for end-users using the publicly available World Voicemail app.\nP ag e | 1\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nIn FY19, Norwood signed a four-year contract with Spark NZ for the supply of World Voicemail software licences, white label\nWorld Voicemail Apps and professional services. Post-FY22, long-term customer Spark NZ supplied the Company with several\nPurchase Orders worth approximately NZD$682,000 for services to be provided across FY23 relating to the contract, which is a\ntestament to the robust and ongoing relationship between the two companies.\nPrior to this Agreement, Norwood had received other Purchase Orders from Spark NZ, notably a Purchase Order worth\napproximately NZD$639,000 announced in early FY22 for services to be provided across FY22 relating to the contract.\nCognitive Voice Services\nAs previously noted, Norwood has invested considerable resources over the past two years in developing cutting-edge software.\nOne such focus has been on utilising conversational AI and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) engines to provide a brand-\nnew service (or services) based on Cognitive Voice capabilities, complementing Norwood’s existing World Voicemail service\nofferings.\nIn late FY22, Norwood passed a further critical milestone by releasing the first beta releases for its new, revolutionary AI-\npowered “Cognitive Voice Services Platform”, referred to as “Aïda” in previous updates and announcements. The Company\nintends to re-brand Aïda in the near term, in line with its most recent positioning of the platform and derivative applications\nthat have arisen, targeting the global CSP market.\nThe Company was delighted to secure an early paid proof-of-concept for Aïda from a Tier 1 CSP in the Australian market via its\ndeveloping partnership with Infosys. Following this win, Norwood has been seeing highly encouraging interest in potential\napplications derived from the core Aïda platform by CSPs in multiple regions around the world.\nNorwood’s current focus in this space, which comprises the core R&D and marketing direction of the Company, is to leverage\nthe potential of emerging conversational AI technologies to bring to market compelling, brand-new “Cognitive Voice”\napplications for CSPs.\nThese new intelligent, AI-powered voice service platforms can provide CSPs with new ways to monetise their ageing Voice\nnetworks, providing novel sources of new revenue, whilst delighting and surprising their subscribers. New services can be\ncreated through the deployment of high-quality virtual personal assistants that are based on the powerful available\nconversational AI engines, as well as Norwood’s own unique intellectual property, developed internally over the past two years.\nThese exciting technological developments Norwood is progressing, in tandem with the early positive response from CSPs on\nthese propositions and our improved financial position has brought considerable internal optimism about the Company’s\nfuture.\nI’d like to extend a special thanks to our employees, who all did their part to facilitate a smooth transition to working from\nhome as COVID-19 reached Western Australia. As a result, Norwood experienced limited productivity disruption from the\npandemic.\nWe are in a healthy operational and financial position to build on this positive momentum and execute potential future\ncontracts. As a Company we continue to be extremely confident about our future and are looking forward to the year ahead.\nI look forward to updating you during the course of FY23 on these exciting new opportunities being progressed by Norwood.\nPAUL OSTERGAARD\nManaging Director 28 September 2022\nP ag e | 2\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nDirectors' report\nYour directors present their report on the consolidated entity, consisting of Norwood Systems Limited (NOR or the Company)\nand its controlled entities (collectively the Group), for the financial year ended 30 June 2022.\nNorwood is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX:NOR).\n1.

Operations Review\nWe are delighted to present the Norwood Systems Limited (Norwood) FY22 operational report.\nAs a Company, we provide solutions to communications service providers (CSPs), both directly and via intermediaries. The\nCompany’s most successful core proposition to date has been in the area of voicemail services. In addition to such services,\nthe Company is now starting to benefit from a two-year long research and development campaign to deliver new\n“cognitive” AI-based solutions.\nThe sales and partnerships we have confirmed during 2021-22 span both the heritage suite of voicemail services and also\nincreasingly the Company’s newer AI-based services, which is the major focus of Norwood’s ongoing sales and business\ndevelopment activity.\nIn FY22, Norwood laid the platform for long-term and sustainable growth, as the Company expanded its revenue base with\nmajor new relationships that have led to new contracts from blue chip clients, enhancing its operational capabilities and\nposition in the market for CSP-hosted value-added service platforms.\nOver the past four years, Norwood has steadily increased its core revenues from clients (net of R&D tax credits and\nJobKeeper payments) whilst showing ongoing improvements in its core operating losses.\nCore operating metrics1 FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 FY 2022\nCore Revenue ($) 71,602 492,099 804,012 922,197\nNet profit/(loss) ($) (3,018,521) (2,012,222) (1,190,858) (1,083,468)\nWith most of the effects of the pandemic behind the Company, and with the borders to Western Australia finally opening,\nthe company also witnessed a resurgence of business development activity in the second half of FY 2022, as detailed below.\nNorwood formed a global technology and services supply relationship with Infosys during the second half of the fiscal year\nand has already secured two contracts under this relationship.\nThis included the supply of an innovative subscription-based communications solution to a Germany-based client of Infosys,\nwhich has the potential to generate ongoing recurring revenue beyond the initial 12-month scope. Norwood was also\nawarded another contract under the relationship to deliver a proof-of-concept product for a Tier 1 telco operator in\nAustralia.\nThe work Norwood is delivering under the global technology relationship with Infosys leverages the Company’s elastically\nscalable, high-availability, cloud-native platform architecture that it has developed for deploying its core communications\nservice platforms.\nThe Company also continued to make strong progress on its key contract with long-term customer Spark NZ. Early in FY22,\nSpark NZ supplied Norwood with a purchase order worth approximately NZD$639,000 (c. AUD$603,000) for services to be\nprovided across the 2022 financial year.\nThis large purchase order represents another forward step in the continued positive evolution of the relationship with\nSpark NZ, after an agreement between the Company and Spark NZ was initially announced in January 2020.\nNorwood made substantial strides in developing its emerging technological solutions in FY22, which will help underpin\nlong-term growth. This included the successful release of the World Voicemail Version 4.0, which built on earlier releases\nwith support for a new, significantly improved, AI-powered speech-to-text transcription engine.\nThe launch of Norwood's World Voicemail Version 4.0 platform and associated core technologies enables the Company to\ndeliver significant additional utility and differentiation in the worldwide telco voicemail market.\nNorwood also significantly progressed its Aïda service, which is targeted at CSPs who are interested in modernising their\ngeneral inbound voice call completion network services, to serve as a 5G Voice Innovation Service for such CSPs’ small and\nmidsize business (SMB) or prosumer subscribers.\nAïda has a “dynamic transactional memory” that aids the service considerably in building robust and engaging dialogue\nflows. The Company has pitched Aïda to both prospective CSPs and vendor partners, receiving a positive response which\nculminated in the first contract secured via Infosys.\n1 Unaudited, adjusted for R&D Tax and JobKeeper payments.\nP ag e | 4\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nDirectors' report\nFollowing this, in the June quarter of FY22, Norwood successfully launched beta releases of the first productised service for\nthe Aïda Intelligent Assistant service to selected customers and partners.\n5.3. Corporate\nCapital Raising\nOn 12 October 2021, Norwood announced that it had received firm commitments to raise $0.3 million via a Share\nPlacement of 17,647,058 ordinary shares and $0.1 million via a Convertible Notes issue.\nThe Share Placement was conducted at $0.017 per share to sophisticated investors, a 4.3% premium to the Company’s 15-\nday VWAP prior to the capital raise.\nACNS Capital Markets Pty Ltd T/A Alto Capital (“Alto”) was Lead Manager to the Placement. As announced on 21 October\n2021, Alto closed the placement oversubscribed by $23,000, to raise $323,000.\nThe Company also executed a binding term sheet and issued 4,166,667 Convertible Notes with a face value of $0.024 each\nto Paul Ostergaard, Managing Director of the Company, to raise $100,000.\nThe funds raised were utilised to successfully obtain new telco contracts, as well as further enhancing the Company’s\nflagship World Voicemail product, including the forthcoming revolutionary Intelligent Assistant service.\nOn 28 March 2022, Norwood announced that it had executed a binding terms sheet and issued 280,000 convertible notes\nwith a face value of $1 each to Balmain Resources Pty Ltd, a Company controlled by Non-executive Director Dr John Tarrant,\nto raise $280,000 for the Company.\nAlso on 28 March 2022, Norwood announced that the Board had agreed to fully subscribe for the NOROC Shortfall Options\nin accordance with its Prospectus dated 16 February 2022 (‘NOROC Option Offer’).\nThe NOROC Option Offer offered up to 66,356,636 NOROC Options. The Options had an issue price of $0.002 per option,\nexercisable at $0.08 expiring 3 March 2023. The Company announced on 3 March 2022, the shortfall amount of 34,457,676\nOptions and an allotment at that time of 7,759,025 options under the shortfall offer, leaving a net shortfall of 26,698,651\noptions.\nOn 5 May 2022, Norwood announced it had executed a fully underwritten 1 for 7 Non-renounceable Rights Entitlement\nissue to raise $637,590 (“the offer”). The offer also included a 1 for 1 free attaching option exercisable at 2.4 cents expiring\n31 December 2023. The $0.015 Offer issue price represented a 25% premium to the Company’s previous closing price of\n$0.012.\nOn 23 June 2022, Norwood announced that it had executed a deed of variation to a convertible note binding term sheet\nfor an additional 200,000 convertible notes with a face value of $1 each to Balmain Resources Pty Ltd, a Company controlled\nby Non-executive Director Dr John Tarrant. The convertible note issue to Dr Tarrant raised $200,000 for the Company. The\ninitial convertible note was executed and announced to ASX on 28 March 2022.\nFunds raised from these capital raisings ensure that Norwood is well capitalised to execute on its current client projects, as\nwell as existing service innovation projects, such as the Aïda platform, which is designed to provide new options for telco\npartners in how they handle voice calls on their networks.\nP ag e | 5\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nDirectors' report\nBoard Changes\nNorwood is positioning itself for a phase of growth following the highly promising internal and external testing of the Aïda\nIntelligent Assistant service, as well as positive CSP responses to the Company’s ongoing updates to its World Voicemail\nservice platform.\nIn light of these promising developments, Norwood refreshed its board composition to enhance the breadth of leadership\nexperience and expertise required to underpin the next phase of growth for the Company.\nOn H1 FY22, Norwood announced Mr Stuart Usher had been appointed as Company Secretary and Chief Financial Officer\n(CFO), replacing Mr Steven Wood who has resigned from the role due to other work commitments.\nMr Usher is a CPA and Chartered Company Secretary with 25 years of extensive experience in the management and\ncorporate affairs of publicly listed companies.\nIn H2 FY22, Norwood appointed highly credentialled industry leaders with extensive track records across the telco and\nbroader technology space; as Phil Marsland, Philip Otley, and Dr John Tarrant joined the Company’s board.\nPhil Marsland was formerly Head of Customer Marketing and Head of PostPay at Vodafone UK and now runs his own\nconsultancy utilising skills he developed in senior roles at a range of top tier companies including Capital One Bank Europe\nplc, American Express, Virgin Active and Applied Predictive Technologies. He has a strong commercial knowledge of\nbusiness drivers that drive performance, growing both larger and smaller businesses alike.\nPhilip Otley is an expert in defining and creating strategic growth platforms and digital and data-powered business models.\nHe has served as Partner/Senior Executive & Pricing Strategy Practice Leader for Accenture (ACN), as Senior Partner &\nGlobal Co-lead of the Marketing Strategy Practice for Prophet, and a Partner in the Digital Services practice of PwC Australia.\nMr Otley has a proven track record of applying balanced strategic, commercial, and creative approaches to achieve organic\nand M&A driven growth.\nDr John Tarrant has extensive and deep professional networks from a career spanning over 40 years across the finance,\nlegal, mining and energy sectors. Dr Tarrant has a Doctor of Philosophy and a Doctor of Juridical Science, both in law.\nThe trio joined CEO and Founder Paul Ostergaard on the Norwood board.\n5.4. Outlook\nNorwood heads into FY23 in the strongest operational position it has been in for a number of years. The Company is\nexposed to tangible growth opportunities on several fronts, including the strong potential to secure additional work via its\nglobal technology relationship with Infosys.\nNorwood has successfully completed one contract under the relationship that subsequently demonstrated the Company’s\noperational excellence and responsiveness to Infosys, as well as continuing to progress the other contract.\nThe Company is also continuing to evolve its World Voicemail service and application, which underpins Norwood’s purchase\norder from Spark NZ and Norwood’s underlying relationship with Spark NZ.\nThe highly promising Aïda Intelligent Assistant service offers another tangible avenue of growth for Norwood, and the\nCompany will expand its test releases of the service in the coming months.\nOver FY23, Norwood will focus on consolidating its stronger revenue base and boosting cost efficiencies.\nNorwood has enhanced its balance sheet strength to capitalise on the outlined opportunities, with a bolstered cash position\nat 30 June 2022 of $497,000, compared to $114,000 at 31 March 2022 and $58,474 at 30 June 2021.\nP ag e | 6\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nDirectors' report\n5.5. Financial Review\nThe financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of normal business\nactivity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Group incurred a loss for the year of $1,083,468 (2021: $870,660 loss) and a net cash out-flow from operating activities\nof $1,091,663 (2021: $402,946 out-flow). As at 30 June 2022, the Company had a working capital deficit of $956,693 (2021:\n$1,242,344 working capital deficit).\nThe ability of the Group to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Group securing additional debt and/or equity\nfunding and/or generating profits from its normal course of business.\nThese conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast a significant doubt about the Group's ability\nto continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the\nnormal course of business. The Directors are confident that there will be sufficient funds for the Group to meet its\nobligations and liabilities and believe it is appropriate to prepare these accounts on a going concern basis for the following\nreasons:\n◼ Director loans as at 30 June 2022 of $480,000 are anticipated to be approved at the upcoming Annual General\nMeeting to be converted into shares of the Company;\n◼ Management have prepared a cashflow forecast for the next 12 months from the date of this report that indicates\nthe operating cash inflows will be sufficient to meet expenses and other financial obligations as an when they are\ndue;\n◼ Managing cash flows in line with available funds; and\n◼ The Group has the ability to raise funds from equity sources and has a successful record of past raisings that gives\nthe board confidence that it can complete further capital raisings if required.\nThe Directors plan to continue the Group’s operations on the basis disclosed above and believe that there will be sufficient\nfunds for the Group to meet its obligations and liabilities for at least 12 months from the date of this report. In the event\nthat the Group is unable to generate sufficient revenue in the normal course of business or secure additional funds through\nnew share issues or borrowings, the Group may need to reduce costs or negotiate extended terms with key creditors in\norder to meet working capital requirements. Should the Group be unable to successfully execute one or more of the\naforementioned matters, there exists a material uncertainty that may cause significant doubt on the Group’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and therefore that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business.\nThe financial report does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset\namounts or liabilities that might be necessary should the entity not continue as a going concern and meet its debts as and\nwhen they become due and payable.\nThe Group’s revenue for the year ended 30 June 2022 was recorded at $1,229,100 as compared with the previous year\nended 30 June 2021 which recorded $1,050,831.\nThe net liabilities of the Group have decreased from 30 June 2021 by $312,385 to $(835,135) at 30 June 2022 (2021:\n$(1,147,520) net liabilities).\nAs at 30 June 2022, the Group's cash and cash equivalents increased from 30 June 2021 by $438,457 to $496,931 at 30\nJune 2022 (2021: $58,474). Refer to the Operations Review above for additional business segment performance.\n5.6. Key Business Risks\nThe Group is subject to various risk factors. Some of these are specific to its business activities while others are of a more\ngeneral nature. Individually, or in combination, these risk factors may affect the future operating and financial performance\nof the Group.\na. Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic\nNorwood continues to consider the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business. Throughout 2022, NOR has\ncontinued to manage the risk that COVID-19 poses to the health and safety of its workforce across all jurisdictions that it\noperates in. COVID-19 also poses implications to other risks highlighted including financial; operational; supply-chain; and\nemployee management, including attracting and retaining talent.\nP ag e | 7\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nDirectors' report\nb. Strategic Risk\nNorwood operates in a client-focused industry and is therefore exposed to the evolving preferences and requirements of\nits clients. The Company is focused on mitigating strategic risk by engaging with senior leaders at key clients and potential\nclients on a highly frequent basis. These engagements ensure that the Company's products and services remain relevant\nand attractive to the market.\nc. Financing Risk\nThe Company requires capital to progress its business strategy and capture future growth opportunities. Financing risk is\nbeing mitigated by recent recapitalisation efforts, which have strengthened Norwood’s balance sheet significantly. The\nCompany has entered the 2023 fiscal year with more cash on hand than at any point in FY22, and a more substantial\nrevenue base than it has had in its history.\nd. Key Man Risk\nNorwood operates in a highly-specialised industry and is subsequently reliant on the specialised expertise and experience\nof a relatively small number of individuals, particularly in leadership positions. The Company is mitigating the key man risk\nby strengthening its leadership team, such as the board refresh it conducted during FY22, and by actively having high-level\nplans in place in the event of incapacity of key leaders.\ne. Laws, regulations and geopolitical landscape\nNorwood operates in a highly regulated industry in all markets in which goods are manufactured and sold. Changing\ngeopolitical landscapes and regulations in each of these jurisdictions may impact many aspects of our operations, including\ntax assessment and dividend payments to the Group and all aspects of the supply chain (access to raw materials,\nproduction, manufacturing, pricing, marketing, advertising, labour, distribution, and product sales). Remaining compliant\nwith, abreast of, and responsive to changes (some of which can significantly impact the nature of operations in these\nmarkets) requires diligent monitoring and responsiveness by the business.\nf. Cybersecurity and data management\nData and information security is essential to protect business critical intellectual property and data privacy. Continuing\nadvances in technology, systems, and communication channels mean increasing amounts of private and confidential data\nare now stored electronically. This, together with increasing cybercrime, heightens the need for robust data security\nmeasures.\ng. Key partnerships\nNorwood relies on select key markets and customers (distributors and retailers) to support sales and delivery of strategic\ninitiatives. Suboptimal performance of these markets or key customers, and/or detrimental shifts in market power, could\nhave a significant impact on Norwood’s ability to deliver against strategic initiatives.\nh. People and culture\nNorwood’s ability to deliver on strategic targets is reliant on retaining and attracting experienced, skilled, and motivated\ntalent. It also requires strong, resilient, and effective leaders as the business grows at pace.\ni. Safety, health and wellbeing\nNorwood cares about the physical and psychological safety, health and wellbeing of our customers, team members and\nbusiness partners, including employees of our suppliers. We are committed to creating a safe and supportive environment\nfor everyone working with, using, and impacted by our products and brand. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and in the\nlast 2 years in particular, Norwood has ensured that measures were in place to protect our team members and business\npartners as a matter of priority.\nj. Consumer and marketplace\nUnanticipated changes in consumer preferences and demand, or competitive pressures that significantly alter the market\nlandscape (for example COVID-19, online channel growth, acquisitions, aggressive price wars) can have adverse effects on\nthe business’s ability to capture growth opportunities or effectively manage inventory and supply.\nk. Significant business interruption\nNorwood’s current scope of operations could expose it to a range of business disruption risks, such as environmental\ncatastrophes, pandemics (such as COVID-19), natural and manmade hazards and incidents, or politically motivated violence\nor actions. Significant business disruption could result in Norwood’s sites or employees being harmed or threatened, loss\nof key infrastructure, impacts to supply chain, manufacturing and inventory shortages or loss, financial and reputation\nimpacts.\nP ag e | 8\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nDirectors' report\nl. Business transformation\nThe business continues to focus on transformation initiatives that support effective and efficient end-to-end processes.\nDelivery of these initiatives will be critical to Norwood’s ability to optimise our existing asset base and drive efficiencies\nwhile sustaining growth.\n5.7. Events Subsequent to Reporting Date\nThere are no other significant after balance date events that are not covered in this Directors' Report or within the financial\nstatements as disclosed in Note 13 Events subsequent to reporting date on page 55.\n5.8. Future Developments, Prospects and Business Strategies\nLikely developments in the operations of the Group have been disclosed in the Operating and Financial Review section of\nthe Directors’ Report.\nOther likely developments, future prospects and business strategies of the operations of the Group and the expected\nresults of those operations, not otherwise disclosed in this report, have not been included in this report as the Directors\nbelieve that the inclusion of such information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Group.\n5.9. Environmental Regulations\nThe Group's operations are not subject to any other significant environmental regulations in the jurisdictions it operates\nin, namely Australia, New Zealand and the United States.\n6.

Remuneration report (audited)\nb. Performance-Linked Remuneration\nThe remuneration policy is tailored to increase goal congruence between shareholders and Directors and key\nmanagement personnel. This is facilitated through bonus schemes and the issue of options and performance securities\nto key management personnel to encourage the alignment of personal and shareholder interests. The Directors believe\nthis policy will be effective in increasing shareholder wealth. Currently, remuneration is incentive-based however\nefforts have been made to progressively move towards a performance-linked remuneration policy.\nPrinciples used to determine the nature and amount of variable remuneration: Relationship between remuneration\nand company performance.\nThe Directors assess the performance of the Group with regard to the price of the Company’s ordinary shares listed on\nthe ASX and the market capitalisation of the Company with Group financial performance. As the Company matures,\ngreater emphasis will be placed on performance-linked remuneration.\nThe Company currently has incentives incorporated into executive service agreements based on the execution of\nmaterial revenue generating contracts which should have direct correlation to company performance.\nDirectors and executives are issued options and, in some cases, performance securities, to encourage the alignment of\npersonal and shareholder interests.\nOptions issued to Directors may be subject to market-based price hurdles and vesting conditions and the exercise price\nof options is set at a level that encourages the Directors to focus on share price appreciation. The Group believes this\npolicy will be effective in increasing shareholder wealth. Key management personnel are also entitled to participate in\nthe employee share and option arrangements.\nPerformance securities vest on the achievement of operational milestones, providing those directors are holding\nperformance securities as an incentive to meet the operational milestones prior to the expiry date of the performance\nsecurities.\nOn the resignation of Directors any vested options issued as remuneration are retained by the relevant party.\nThe Board may exercise discretion in relation to approving incentives such as options. The policy is designed to reward\nkey management personnel for performance that results in long-term growth in shareholder value.\nIn considering the entity’s performance and benefits for shareholders’ wealth, the Directors have regard to the\nfollowing indices in respect of the current financial year and the previous four financial years.\n2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\n$ $ $ $ $\nLoss after income tax (1,083,468) (870,660) (1,891,225) (3,032,364) (4,044,223)\nThe factors that are considered to affect total shareholders return (TSR) are summarised below:\n2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\nShare price at financial year end ($) 0.012 0.015 0.021 0.05 0.07\nTotal dividends declared (cents per\nshare) - - - - -\nBasic loss per share ($) (0.38) (0.34) (0.85) (2.05) (3.40)\nc.

A performance\nobligation is a promise to transfer distinct goods or services (or a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially\nthe same and that have the same pattern of transfer) to the customer that is explicitly stated in the contract and implied in\nthe Group's customary business practices.\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring\nthe promised goods or services to the customers, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as sales taxes\nor services taxes. If the amount of consideration varies due to discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, incentives, penalties or\nother similar items, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled based on the expected\nvalue or the most likely outcome. If the contract with a customer contains more than one performance obligation, the\namount of consideration is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of the\ngoods or services promised in the contract. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant\nreversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable\nconsideration is subsequently resolved.\nP ag e | 28\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 1 Revenue and other income (cont.)\nThe control of the promised goods or services may be transferred over time or at a point in time. The control over the goods\nor services is transferred over time and revenue is recognised over time if:\ni. the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group\nperforms;\nii. the Group's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced;\nor\niii. the Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Group has an enforceable right to\npayment for performance completed to date.\nRevenue for performance obligation that is not satisfied over time is recognised at the point in time at which the customer\nobtains control of the promised goods or services.\n1.4.2 Revenue from sale of goods and development fees and licensing fees\nThe Group recognises revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a\ncustomer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of that asset. Revenue is recognised when the goods\nare shipped to the customer.\n1.4.3 Revenue from rendering of services\nRevenue from monitoring services (subscriptions) is recognised over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and\nconsumes the services performed by the Group (i.e. monitoring of an alarm system by Norwood Systems).\n1.4.4 Interest income\nInterest revenue is recognised in accordance with Note 3.1 Finance income and expenses.\nNote 2.

Accounting policy\na. Short-term benefits\nLiabilities for employee benefits for wages, salaries and annual leave that are expected to be settled within 12 months of\nthe reporting date represent present obligations resulting from employees' services provided to the reporting date and are\ncalculated at undiscounted amounts based on remuneration wage and salary rates that the Group expects to pay at the\nreporting date including related on-costs, such as workers compensation insurance and payroll tax.\nNon-accumulating non-monetary benefits, such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised goods and services,\nare expensed based on the net marginal cost to the Group as the benefits are taken by the employees.\nb. Other long-term benefits\nThe Group's obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits other than defined benefit plans, such as long service\nleave, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods\nplus related on-costs; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any related assets is\ndeducted. The discount rate is the Reserve Bank of Australia's cash rate at the report date that have maturity dates\napproximating the terms of the Company's obligations. Any actuarial gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss in the\nperiod in which they arise.\nc. Retirement benefit obligations: Defined contribution superannuation funds\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions onto a\nseparate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to\ndefined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.\nd. Termination benefits\nWhen applicable, the Group recognises a liability and expense for termination benefits at the earlier of: (a) the date when\nthe Group can no longer withdraw the offer for termination benefits; and (b) when the Group recognises costs for\nrestructuring pursuant to AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and the costs include\ntermination benefits. In either case, unless the number of employees affected is known, the obligation for termination\nbenefits is measured on the basis of the number of employees expected to be affected. Termination benefits that are\nexpected to be settled wholly before 12 months after the annual reporting period in which the benefits are recognised are\nmeasured at the (undiscounted) amounts expected to be paid. All other termination benefits are accounted for on the same\nbasis as other long-term employee benefits.\ne. Equity-settled compensation\nThe fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair\nvalue is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled\nto the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model, considering the\nterms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised is adjusted to reflect the actual number\nof share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to market conditions not being met.\nNote 3. Other Significant Accounting Policies related to items of profit and loss\n3.1. Finance income and expenses\nFinance income comprises interest income on funds invested (including available-for-sale financial assets), gains on the\ndisposal of available-for-sale financial assets and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit\nor loss. Interest revenue is recognised on a time proportionate basis that considers the effective yield on the financial\nasset.\nFinancial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method, unwinding\nof discounts on provisions, changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and impairment\nlosses recognised on financial assets. All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest\nmethod.\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets that necessarily take a\nsubstantial period of time to prepare for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time\nas the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are recognised in income in\nthe period in which they are incurred.\nForeign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.\nP ag e | 30\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 4.

Potential deferred tax assets attributable to tax losses have not been brought to account at 30 June 2022 because the\ndirectors do not believe it is appropriate to regard realisation of the deferred tax assets as probable at this point in time.\nThese benefits will only be obtained if:\ni. the Group derives future assessable income of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from the\ndeductions for the loss to be realised;\nii. the company continues to comply with conditions for deductibility imposed by law; and\niii. no changes in tax legislation adversely affect the Group in realising the benefit from the deductions for the loss.\nBalances disclosed in the financial statements and the notes thereto, related to taxation, are based on the best estimates\nof directors. These estimates consider both the financial performance and position of the company as they pertain to\ncurrent income taxation legislation, and the directors understanding thereof. No adjustment has been made for pending\nor future taxation legislation. The current income tax position represents the directors' best estimate, pending an\nassessment by tax authorities in relevant jurisdictions.\nThe parent company has accumulated tax losses of $7,622,281 (2021: $7,816,407) which are expected to be available\nindefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the parent company in which the losses arose. The recoupment of\nthese losses is subject to assessment by the Australian Taxation Office.\nP ag e | 32\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 4 Income tax (cont.)\n4.9. Accounting policy\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the\napplicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to\ntemporary difference and to unused tax losses.\nThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the\nreporting period in the countries where the Company's subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.\nManagement periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax\nregulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be\npaid to the tax authorities.\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered\nfrom or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted\nor substantively enacted by the balance date, in each jurisdiction.\nDeferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance date between the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except:\n◼ when the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a\ntransaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting\nprofit nor taxable profit or loss; or\n◼ when the taxable temporary difference is associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interests in joint\nventures, and the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the\ntemporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and\nunused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible\ntemporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:\n◼ when the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition\nof an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects\nneither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or\n◼ when the deductible temporary difference is associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates or interests in joint\nventures, in which case a deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary\ndifference will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary\ndifference can be utilised.\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance date and reduced to the extent that it is no\nlonger probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be\nutilised.\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance date and are recognised to the extent that it has\nbecome probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred income tax assets\nand liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability\nis settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date.\nIncome taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in profit or loss. Deferred tax\nassets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against\ncurrent tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation\nauthority.\nNorwood Systems Limited recognises its own current and deferred tax amounts and those current tax liabilities, current tax\nassets and deferred tax assets arising from unused tax credits and unused tax losses which it has assumed from its controlled\nentities within the tax consolidated group.\nAssets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts\npayable or receivable from or payable to other entities in the Group. Any difference between the amounts receivable or\npayable under the tax funding agreement are recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) controlled entities in\nthe tax consolidated group.\nWhere the Group receives the Australian Government's Research and Development Tax Incentive, the Group accounts for\nthe refundable tax offset under AASB 112. Funds are received as a rebate through the parent company's income tax return.\nP ag e | 33\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 5.

The average credit period on sales of goods and rendering of services ranges from 30 to 60 days. Interest is not charged.\nNo allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable trade receivable amounts arising from the past sale of goods and\nrendering of services, determined by reference to past default experience. Amounts are considered as ‘past due’ when the\ndebt has not been settled, within the terms and conditions agreed between the Group and the customer or counter party to\nthe transaction.\n5.2.5. Accounting policy\nTrade receivables are generally due for settlement within periods ranging from 30 to 60 days. Receivables expected to be\ncollected within 12 months of the end of the reporting period are classified as current assets. All other receivables are\nclassified as non-current assets.\nTrade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the\neffective interest method, less any provision for impairment. Impairment of trade receivables is continually reviewed and\nthose that are considered to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly. An allowance account\nis used when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original\ncontractual terms. Factors considered by the Group in making this determination include known significant financial\ndifficulties of the debtor, review of financial information and significant delinquency in making contractual payments to the\nGroup. The impairment allowance is set equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and the\npresent value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Where receivables are short-\nterm discounting is not applied in determining the allowance. (see also Note 5.5.1).\nThe amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. When\na trade receivable for which an impairment allowance had been recognised becomes uncollectible in a subsequent period,\nit is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against\nother expenses in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.\nP ag e | 36\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 5 Financial assets and financial liabilities (cont.)\n5.3.

Fees paid on the establishment of\nloan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility\nwill be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs.

Other Significant Accounting Policies related to Financial Assets and Liabilities\n5.5.1. Investments and other financial assets\na. Classification\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n◼ those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income (OCI) or through profit\nor loss), and\n◼ those to be measured at amortised cost.\nThe classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of\nthe cash flows.\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in\nequity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election\nat the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income\n(FVOCI).\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\nb. Recognition and derecognition\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits\nto purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial\nassets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of\nownership.\nc. Measurement\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair\nvalue through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.\nTransaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows\nare solely payment of principal and interest.\ni. Debt instruments\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset and\nthe cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies\nits debt instruments:\n◼ Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent\nsolely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial\nassets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on\nderecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign\nexchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or\nloss.\n◼ FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the\nassets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in\nthe carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest\nincome and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is\nderecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss\nand recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income\nusing the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses)\nand impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n◼ FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a\ndebt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within\nother gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\nP ag e | 40\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 5 Financial assets and financial liabilities (cont.)\n5.5. Other Significant Accounting Policies related to Financial Assets and Liabilities\nii. Equity instruments\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group’s management has elected\nto present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair\nvalue gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such\ninvestments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to receive payments\nis established.\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit\nor loss as applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at\nFVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.\nd. Impairment\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis, the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried\nat amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant\nincrease in credit risk.\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by AASB 9, which requires expected lifetime\nlosses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\nP ag e | 41\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 6.

Accounting policy\na. Recognition and measurement\nUntil the 2019 financial year, leases of property, plant and equipment were classified as either finance leases or\noperating leases. From 1 July 2019, leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date\nat which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.\ni. Right of Use Asset\nThe Group recognises a right of use asset at the commencement date of the lease. The right of use asset is initially\nmeasured at cost. The cost of right of use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, adjusted for any\nlease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs\nto dismantle, remove or restore the leased asset, less any lease incentives received.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n◼ the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n◼ any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n◼ any initial direct costs; and\n◼ restoration costs.\nP ag e | 42\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 6 Non-financial assets and financial liabilities(cont.)\n6.1 Leases (cont.)\ni Right of Use Asset (cont.)\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated\nuseful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the consolidated entity expects to obtain ownership of the\nleased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject\nto impairment or adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The consolidated entity has elected not to\nrecognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less\nand leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred.\nii. Lease liabilities\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities at the present value of lease payment to\nbe made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less\nany lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to\nbe paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option\nreasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the assessment of\nlease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on\nan index or a rate are recognised as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payments\noccurs. The present value of lease payments is discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if the rate\ncannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. After the commencement date,\nthe amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\nThe amount of lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an\nindex or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value\nguarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination\noption. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right\nof use asset, or is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right of use asset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Group has elected not to recognise right of use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease\nterm of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option, and leases of low value assets. The Group recognises\nthe lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nb. Extension and termination options\nAn extension options is included in a property of the Group. This is used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of\nmanaging the assets used in the Group’s operations. The extension option held is exercisable only by the group and not\nby the respective lessor.\n6.1.6. Critical judgements in determining the lease term\nIn determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to\nexercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options)\nare only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).\nFor leases of properties, the following factors are normally the most relevant:\n◼ If there are significant penalties to terminate (or not extend), the Group is typically reasonably certain to extend (or\nnot terminate).\n◼ Otherwise, the Group considers other factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business\ndisruption required to replace the leased asset.\nThe lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes obliged to exercise\n(or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event or a significant change in\ncircumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee.\nP ag e | 43\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 6 Non-financial assets and financial liabilities(cont.)\n6.2.

Description of provisions\na. Provision for employee benefits represents amounts accrued for annual leave (AL) and long service leave (LSL). The\ncurrent portion for this provision includes the total amount accrued for AL entitlements and the amounts accrued for LSL\nentitlements that have vested due to employees having completed the required period of service. The Group does not\nexpect the full amount of AL or LSL balances classified as current liabilities to be settled within the next 12 months.\nHowever, these amounts must be classified as current liabilities since the Group does not have an unconditional right to\ndefer the settlement of these amounts in the event employees wish to use their leave entitlement.\n6.2.5. Accounting policy\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is\nprobable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable\nestimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\nWhen the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the\nreimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating\nto any provision is presented in the statement of comprehensive income net of any reimbursement.\nP ag e | 44\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 6 Non-financial assets and financial liabilities(cont.)\n6.2 Provisions (cont.)\nProvisions are measured at the present value or management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the\npresent obligation at the end of the reporting period.\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the\nrisks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised\nas an interest expense.\nProvision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion\nof the entity, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting date.\n6.3. Other Significant Accounting Policies related to Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities\n6.3.1. Impairment of non-financial assets\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than deferred tax assets (see accounting policy at note 4.9)\nare reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists\nthen the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable\namount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that largely are\nindependent from other assets and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, unless the asset has\npreviously been revalued, in which case the impairment loss is recognised as a reversal to the extent of that previous\nrevaluation with any excess recognised through the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-\ngenerating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce\nthe carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate\nthat reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that\ndoes not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to\nwhich the asset belongs.\nImpairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has\ndecreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine\nthe recoverable amount.

Financial risk management\n8.1. Financial Risk Management Policies\nThis note presents information about the Group's exposure to the risks, its objectives, policies and procedures for\nmeasuring and managing risk, and the management of capital.\nThe Group's financial instruments consist mainly of deposits with banks, short-term investments, and accounts payable\nand receivable.\nThe Group does not speculate in the trading of derivative instruments.\nA summary of the Group's financial assets and liabilities is shown below:\nFloating Fixed Non- Floating Fixed Non-\nInterest Interest interest 2022 Interest Interest interest 2021\nRate Rate Bearing Total Rate Rate Bearing Total\n$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $\nFinancial Assets\n Cash and cash equivalents 496,931 - - 496,931 58,474 - - 58,474\n Trade and other receivables - - 273,032 273,032 - - 122,475 122,475\nTotal Financial Assets 496,931 - 273,032 769,963 58,474 - 122,475 180,949\nFinancial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities at amortised\ncost\n Trade and other payables - - 491,623 491,623 - - 691,108 691,108\n Borrowings - 323,642 525,000 848,642 - 491,462 - 491,462\nTotal Financial Liabilities - 323,642 1,016,623 1,340,265 - 491,462 691,108 1,182,570\nNet Financial Assets /\n(Liabilities) 496,931 (323,642) (743,591) (570,302) 58,474 (491,462) (568,633) (1,001,621)\n8.2. Specific Financial Risk Exposures and Management\nThe main risk the Group is exposed to through its financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk\nconsisting of interest rate and equity price risk.\nThe Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework.\nThe Board adopts practices designed to identify significant areas of business risk and to effectively manage those risks in\naccordance with the Group's risk profile. This includes assessing, monitoring and managing risks for the Group and setting\nappropriate risk limits and controls. The Group is not of a size nor are its affairs of such complexity to justify the\nestablishment of a formal system for risk management and associated controls. Instead, the Managing Director authorises\nexpenditure however the Group has an expenditure matrix whereby authority is received from the full board.\nP ag e | 48\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 8 Financial risk management (cont.)\n8.2.1. Credit risk\nExposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of contract\nobligations that could lead to a financial loss to the Group.\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the\nGroup. The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient\ncollateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. This information is supplied\nby independent rating agencies where available and, if not available, the Group uses publicly available financial\ninformation and its own trading record to rate its major customers. The Group's exposure and the credit ratings of its\ncounterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst\napproved counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the\nBoard as a whole.\nThe Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and\nother receivables.\n◼ Credit risk exposures\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk is that to its alliance partners and that is limited to the carrying amount, net of\nany provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the\nfinancial statements.\nCredit risk related to balances with banks and other financial institutions is managed by the Group in accordance with\napproved Board policy. Such policy requires that surplus funds are only invested with financial institutions residing in\nAustralia, wherever possible.\n8.2.2. Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's\napproach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its\nliabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage\nto the Group's reputation.\nUltimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, who have built an appropriate liquidity risk\nmanagement framework for the management of the Group's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity\nmanagement requirements. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and\nreserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles\nof financial assets and liabilities. The Group’s ability to raise equity funding in the market is paramount in this regard.\nP ag e | 49\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 8 Financial risk management (cont.)\nTypically, the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash to meet expected operational expenses for a period of 60 days,\nincluding the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot\nreasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.\nThe financial liabilities of the Group include trade and other payables as disclosed in the statement of financial position.\nAll trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and due within 30 days of the reporting date.\n◼ Contractual Maturities\nThe following are the contractual maturities of financial assets and liabilities of the Group:\nWithin 1 Year Greater Than 1 Year Total\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\n$ $ $ $ $ $\nFinancial liabilities due for payment\nTrade and other payables 491,623 691,108 - - 491,623 691,108\nBorrowings 848,642 491,462 - - 848,642 491,462\nTotal contractual outflows 1,340,265 1,182,570 - - 1,340,265 1,182,570\nFinancial assets\nCash and cash equivalents 496,931 58,474 - - 496,931 58,474\nTrade and other receivables 273,032 122,475 - - 273,032 122,475\nTotal anticipated inflows 769,963 180,949 - - 769,963 180,949\nNet (outflow) / inflow on financial\ninstruments (570,302) (1,001,621) - - (570,302) (1,001,621)\nIt is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier or at\nsignificantly different amounts.\n8.2.3. Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will\naffect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management\nis to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\nThe Group's activities minimally expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity\nprices and exchange rates. The Group does not enter into derivative financial instruments including foreign exchange\nforward contracts to hedge against financial risk. There has been no change to the Group's exposure to market risks or\nthe manner in which it manages and measures the risk from the previous period.\na. Interest rate risk\nThe company and the Group are exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and\nfloating interest rates. The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and\nfloating rate borrowings.\nP ag e | 50\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 8 Financial risk management (cont.)\nThe Company and the Group’s exposures to interest rate in financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the\nliquidity risk management section of this note.\nb. Price risk\nPrice risk relates to the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of\nchanges in market prices. The Group does not presently hold material amounts subject to price risk. As such the Board\nconsiders price risk as a low risk to the Group.\n8.2.4. Sensitivity Analyses\nThe following table illustrates sensitivities to the Group's exposures to changes in interest rates. The table indicates the\nimpact on how profit and equity values reported at balance sheet date would have been affected by changes in the\nrelevant risk variable that management considers to be reasonably possible. These sensitivities assume that the\nmovement in a particular variable is independent of other variables.\nProfit Equity\na.

Net Fair Values\na. Fair value estimation\nThe fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are presented in the table in Note 8.1 and can be compared\nto their carrying values as presented in the statement of financial position. Fair values are those amounts at which\nan asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length\ntransaction.\nP ag e | 51\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 8 Financial risk management (cont.)\nFinancial instruments whose carrying value is equivalent to fair value due to their nature include:\n◼ Cash and cash equivalents;\n◼ Trade and other receivables; and\n◼ Trade and other payables.\nThe methods and assumptions used in determining the fair values of financial instruments are disclosed in the\naccounting policy notes specific to the asset or liability.\nNote 9. Capital Management\nThe Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while\nmaximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders\nof the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and accumulated losses.\nNone of the Group's entities are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.\nOperating cash flows are used to maintain and expand operations, as well as to make routine expenditures such as tax,\ndividends and general administrative outgoings.\nGearing levels are reviewed by the Board on a regular basis in line with its target gearing ratio, the cost of capital and the\nrisks associated with each class of capital.\nThe working capital position of the Group was as follows:\nNote 2022 2021\n$ $\nCash and cash equivalents 5.1 496,931 58,474\nTrade and other receivables 5.2 273,032 122,475\nTrade and other payables 5.3 (491,623) (691,108)\nBorrowings 5.4 (848,642) (491,462)\nLeases 6.1.2 (117,247) (43,940)\nCurrent provisions 6.2 (269,144) (196,783)\nWorking capital position (956,693) (1,242,344)\nP ag e | 52\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nSECTION C. GROUP STRUCTURE\nThis section provides information which will help users understand how the Group structure affects the financial\nposition and performance of the Group as a whole. In particular, there is information about:\n(a) changes to the structure that occurred during the year as a result of business combinations and the disposal of a\ndiscontinued operation;\n(b) transactions with non-controlling interests; and\n(c) interests in joint operations.\nA list of significant subsidiaries is provided in note 10. This note also discloses details about the Group’s equity\naccounted investments.\nNote 10. Interest in subsidiaries\n10.1. Information about principal subsidiaries\nWhile the accounting parent of the Group is Norwood Systems (Aust) Pty Ltd, the legal and ultimate parent of the Group\nis Norwood Systems Limited. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Norwood Systems\n(Aust) Pty Ltd as accounting parent and the subsidiaries listed in the following table.:\nCountry of Class of Percentage Owned\nIncorporation Shares 2022 2021\n◼ Norwood Systems Limited Australia Ordinary 100.0 100.0\n◼ Norwood Systems (UK) Limited UK Ordinary 100.0 100.0\n◼ Norwood Systems Inc. USA Ordinary 100.0 100.0\nNote 11. Other Significant Accounting Policies related to Group Structure\n11.1. Basis of consolidation\nAs at reporting date, the assets and liabilities of all controlled entities have been incorporated into the consolidated financial\nstatements as well as their results for the year then ended. Where controlled entities have entered (left) the Consolidated\nGroup during the year, their operating results have been included (excluded) from the date control was obtained (ceased).\n11.1.1. Business combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which\ncontrol is transferred to the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to variable returns from another entity and\nhas the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\nThe Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:\n◼ the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus\n◼ the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquire; plus\n◼ if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree;\nless\n◼ the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-\ndate fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable\nassets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nIf those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired and the measurement\nof all amounts has been reviewed, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.\nThe consideration transferred does not include amounts related to settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts\nare generally recognised in profit or loss.\nP ag e | 53\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 11 Other Significant Accounting Policies related to Group Structure (cont.)\n11.1.1 Business combinations (cont.)\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs\nin connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\nWhere settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their\npresent value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate\nat which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is\nclassified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to\nthe fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.\n11.1.2. Subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated\nfinancial statements from the date that control commenced until the date that control ceased.\nThe accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the\nGroup.\nEquity interests in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Group are presented as non-controlling\ninterests. The Group initially recognises non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests in subsidiaries and\nare entitled to a proportionate share of the subsidiary's net assets on liquidation at either fair value or at the non-controlling\ninterests' proportionate share of the subsidiary's net assets. Subsequent to initial recognition, non-controlling interests are\nattributed their share of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income. Non-controlling interests are\nshown separately within the equity section of the statement of financial position and statement of comprehensive income.\nThe grant by the company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group\nis treated as a capital contribution to that subsidiary undertaking. The fair value of employee services received, measured\nby reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary\nundertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.\nLosses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing\nso causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.\nA list of controlled entities is contained in Note 10 Interest In Subsidiaries of the financial statements.\n11.1.3. Loss of control\nUpon the loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests\nand the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is\nrecognised in profit or loss. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interests are measured at\nfair value at the date control is lost. Subsequently it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an available-for-\nsale financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.\n11.1.4. Transactions eliminated on consolidation\nAll intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions,\nare eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nP ag e | 54\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nSECTION D.

Accounting policy\nThe Group has provided payment to service providers and related parties in the form of share-based compensation whereby\nservices are rendered in exchange for shares or rights over shares, equity-settled transactions. The cost of these equity-\nsettled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is\ndetermined using an appropriate valuation model for services provided by employees or where the fair value of the goods\nor services received cannot be reliably estimated.\nFor goods and services received where the fair value can be determined reliably the goods and services and the\ncorresponding increase in equity are measured at that fair value. The fair value of the options granted is adjusted to reflect\nmarket vesting conditions, but excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions\nare included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.\nAt each balance date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options with non-market vesting conditions that are\nexpected to become exercisable.\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in\nwhich the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant parties become fully entitled to\nthe award, vesting date.\nThe cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects (i) the\nextent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the number of awards that, in the opinion of the Directors of the\nGroup, will ultimately vest. This opinion is formed based on the best available information at balance date. No adjustment\nis made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the\ndetermination of fair value at grant date.\nWhere the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not\nbeen modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the\nmodification, as measured at the date of modification.\n19.3.2. Key estimate\na. Share-based payments\nThe Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument at the\ndate at which they are granted. The fair value of options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe model uses assumptions and estimates as inputs. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-\nbased payment transactions are disclosed in Note 19.3.\nP ag e | 61\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 20. Operating segments\n20.1. Identification of reportable segments\nSegment information has been prepared in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting\nthe financial statements of the consolidated Group. The Group’s primary business segment is the provision of voice\ntelecommunication services. The Company operates in one segment, voice telecommunication services.\nAn operating segment is a component of an entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues\nand incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity),\nwhose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about\nresources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is\navailable. This includes start-up operations which are yet to earn revenues. Management will also consider other factors\nin determining operating segments such as the existence of a line manager and the level of segment information\npresented to the board of directors.\nOperating segments have been identified based on the information provided to the chief operating decision makers –\nbeing the executive management team.\nThe group aggregates two or more operating segments when they have similar economic characteristics, and the\nsegments are similar in the nature of revenue generated. Operating segments that meet the quantitative criteria as\nprescribed by AASB 8 are reported separately. However, an operating segment that does not meet the quantitative\ncriteria is still reported separately where information about the segment would be useful to users of the financial\nstatements.\nP ag e | 62\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 21.

Statement of significant accounting policies\nThis note provides a list of the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements\nto the extent they have not already been disclosed in the other notes above. These policies have been consistently applied to all the\nyears presented, unless otherwise stated.\n22.1. Basis of preparation\n22.1.1. Reporting Entity\nNorwood Systems Limited (Norwood or the Company) is a listed public company limited by shares, domiciled and\nincorporated in Australia. These are the consolidated financial statements and notes of Norwood and controlled entities\n(collectively the Group). The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of the Group. For the\npurposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a for-profit entity. The Group is a for-profit\nentity and is primarily involved in mobile voice, messaging, data and cyber security services.\nThe separate financial statements of Norwood, as the parent entity, have not been presented with this financial report as\npermitted by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n22.1.2. Basis of accounting\nThese financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AAS Board) and\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and\nthe Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\nAustralian Accounting Standards (AASBs) set out accounting policies that the AAS Board has concluded would result in a\nfinancial report containing relevant and reliable information about transactions, events and conditions to which they apply.\nCompliance with AASBs ensures that the financial statements and notes also comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue on 28 September 2022 by the directors of the Company.\n22.1.3. Going Concern\nThe financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of normal business\nactivity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Group incurred a loss for the year of $1,083,468 (2021: $870,660 loss) and a net cash out-flow from operating activities\nof $1,091,663 (2021: $402,946 out-flow). As at 30 June 2022, the Company has a working capital deficit of $956,693 (2021:\n$1,242,344 working capital deficit), as disclosed in Note 9 of the Capital Management note.\nThe ability of the Group to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Group securing additional debt and/or equity\nfunding and generating profits from its normal course of business.\nThese conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast a significant doubt about the Group's ability\nto continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the\nnormal course of business. The Directors are confident that there will be sufficient funds for the Group to meet its\nobligations and liabilities and believe it is appropriate to prepare these accounts on a going concern basis for the following\nreasons:\n◼ Director loans as at 30 June 2022 of $480,000 are anticipated to be approved at the upcoming Annual General\nMeeting to be converted into shares of the Company;\n◼ Management have prepared a cashflow forecast for the next 12 months from the date of this report that indicates\nthe operating cash inflows will be sufficient to meet expenses and other financial obligations as an when they are\ndue;\n◼ Managing cash flows in line with available funds; and\n◼ The Group has the ability to raise funds from equity sources and has a successful record for past raisings that gives\nthe board confidence that it can complete further capital raisings if required.\nThe Directors plan to continue the Group’s operations on the basis disclosed above and believe that there will be sufficient\nfunds for the Group to meet its obligations and liabilities for at least 12 months from the date of this report. In the event\nthat the Group is unable to generate sufficient revenue in the normal course of business or secure additional funds through\nnew share issues or borrowings, the Group may need to reduce costs or negotiate extended terms with key creditors in\norder to meet working capital requirements. Should the Group be unable to successfully execute one or more of the\naforementioned matters, there exists a material uncertainty that may cause significant doubt on the Group’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern and therefore that it may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business.\nP ag e | 64\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 22. Statement of significant accounting policies\nThe financial report does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset\namounts or liabilities that might be necessary should the entity not continue as a going concern and meet its debts as and\nwhen they become due and payable.\n22.1.4. Comparative figures\nWhere required by AASBs comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation for the current\nfinancial year.\nWhere the Group retrospectively applies an accounting policy, makes a retrospective restatement or reclassifies items in its\nfinancial statements, an additional (third) statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period in\naddition to the minimum comparative financial statements is presented.\n22.1.5. New and Amended Standards Adopted by the Group\nThe Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for their annual reporting period\ncommencing 1 July 2021:\n◼ AASB 2018-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Definition of a Business\n◼ AASB 2018-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Definition of Material\n◼ AASB 2019-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – References to the Conceptual Framework\n◼ AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n◼ AASB 2019-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure of the Effect of New IFRS Standards Not Yet\nIssued in Australia\n◼ AASB 2020-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions.\nThe amendments listed above did not have any impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to\nsignificantly affect the current or future periods.\n22.2. Value added taxes\nValue-added tax (VAT) is the generic term for the broad-based consumption taxes that the Group is exposed to such as:\nAustralia (Goods and Services Tax or GST) and in the USA (Sales Tax), hereafter collectively referred to as GST.\nRevenues, expenses, and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not\nrecoverable from the taxation authority. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of\nthe asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the statement of financial position are shown\ninclusive of GST.\nThe net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the Australian Taxation Office (or jurisdictional equivalent) is\nincluded as a current asset or liability in the balance sheet.\nCash flows are presented in the statement of cash flows on a gross basis, except for the GST component of investing and\nfinancing activities, which are disclosed as operating cash flows.\nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation\nauthority.\n22.3. Foreign currency transactions and balances\n22.3.1. Functional and presentation currency\nThe functional currency of each of the Group's entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic environment\nin which that entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars which is the legal\nparent entity's functional and presentation currency. The functional currency of Norwood Systems Inc. is the United States\nDollar.\n22.3.2. Transaction and balances\nForeign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the\ntransaction. Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Non-monetary items measured\nat historical cost continue to be carried at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured\nat fair value are reported at the exchange rate at the date when fair values were determined.\nExchange rate differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the profit or loss except where\ndeferred in equity as a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge.\nExchange rate differences arising on the translation of non-monetary items are recognised directly in other comprehensive\nincome to the extent that the gain or loss is directly recognised in other comprehensive income, otherwise the exchange\ndifference is recognised in the profit or loss.\nP ag e | 65\nANNUAL REPORT NORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED\n30 June 2022 AND CONTROLLED ENTITIES\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 22. Statement of significant accounting policies\n22.3.3. Group companies and foreign operations\nThe financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the Group's presentation\ncurrency are translated as follows:\n◼ assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date;\n◼ income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period; and\n◼ retained earnings are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.\nExchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the Group's foreign currency\ntranslation reserve in the statement of financial position. These differences are recognised in the profit or loss in the period\nin which the operation is disposed.\n22.4. Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and\nassumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.\nThese estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various factors that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of\nassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised\nin the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.\nJudgements made by management in the application of AASBs that have significant effect on the consolidated financial\nstatements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in Note 22.4.1.\n22.4.1. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\nManagement discusses with the Board the development, selection and disclosure of the Group's critical accounting policies\nand estimates and the application of these policies and estimates. The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk\nof causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed\nbelow.\na. Key estimate – Taxation\nRefer 4.8 in the Income Tax note.\nb. Key estimate – Share-based payments\nRefer Note 19 Share-based payments\n22.4.2. Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\nJudgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had, or may have,\non the Group based on known information. This consideration extends to the nature of the supply chain, staffing and\ngeographic regions in which the Group operates. Other than as addressed in specific notes, there does not currently appear\nto be either any significant impact upon the financial statements or any significant uncertainties with respect to events or\nconditions which may impact the Group unfavourably as at the reporting date or subsequently as a result of the Coronavirus\n(COVID-19) pandemic.\n22.5. Fair Value\n22.5.1. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\nThe Group measures some of its assets and liabilities at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis, depending\non the requirements of the applicable AASB.\nFair value is the price the Group would receive to sell an asset or would have to pay to transfer a liability in an orderly\nunforced transaction between independent, knowledgeable and willing market participants at the measurement date.\nAs fair value is a market-based measure, the closest equivalent observable market pricing information is used to determine\nfair value. Adjustments to market values may be made having regard to the characteristics of the specific asset or liability.\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are determined using one or more valuation\ntechniques. These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent possible, the use of observable market data.\nTo the extent possible, market information is extracted from either the principal market for the asset or liability (i.e. the\nmarket with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability) or, in the absence of such a market, the most\nadvantageous market available to the entity at the end of the reporting period (i.e. the market that maximises the receipts\nfrom the sale of the asset or minimises the payments made to transfer the liability, after taking into account transaction\ncosts and transport costs).\nP ag e | 66\nNORWOOD SYSTEMS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT\nAND CONTROLLED ENTITIES 30 June 2022\nABN 15 062 959 540\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended 30 June 2022\nNote 22. Statement of significant accounting policies\nFor non-financial assets, the fair value measurement also considers a market participant's ability to use the asset in its\nhighest and best use or to sell it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\nThe fair value of liabilities and the entity's own equity instruments (excluding those related to share-based payment\narrangements) may be valued, where there is no observable market price in relation to the transfer of such financial\ninstruments, by reference to observable market information where such instruments are held as assets. Where this\ninformation is not available, other valuation techniques are adopted and, where significant, are detailed in the respective\nnote to the financial statements.\n22.5.2. Fair value hierarchy\nAASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires the disclosure of fair value information by level of the fair value hierarchy, which\ncategorises fair value measurements into one of three possible levels based on the lowest level that an input that is\nsignificant to the measurement can be categorised into as follows:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nMeasurements based on quoted prices Measurements based on inputs other than Measurements based on unobservable\n(unadjusted) in active markets for quoted prices included in Level 1 that are inputs for the asset or liability.\nidentical assets or liabilities that the observable for the asset or liability, either\nentity can access at the measurement directly or indirectly.\ndate.\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are determined using one or more valuation\ntechniques. These valuation techniques maximise, to the extent possible, the use of observable market data. If all significant\ninputs required to measure fair value are observable, the asset or liability is included in Level 2. If one or more significant\ninputs are not based on observable market data, the asset or liability is included in Level 3.\nThe Group would change the categorisation within the fair value hierarchy only in the following circumstances:\n◼ if a market that was previously considered active (Level 1) became inactive (Level 2 or Level 3) or vice versa; or\n◼ if significant inputs that were previously unobservable (Level 3) became observable (Level 2) or vice versa.\nWhen a change in the categorisation occurs, the Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy (i.e.\ntransfers into and out of each level of the fair value hierarchy) on the date the event or change in circumstances occurred.\n22.5.3. Valuation techniques\nThe Group selects a valuation technique that is appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available\nto measure fair value. The availability of sufficient and relevant data primarily depends on the specific characteristics of the\nasset or liability being measured. The valuation techniques selected by the Group are consistent with one or more of the\nfollowing valuation approaches:\n◼ Market approach: valuation techniques that use prices and other relevant information generated by market\ntransactions for identical or similar assets or liabilities.\n◼ Income approach: valuation techniques that convert estimated future cash flows or income and expenses into a single\ndiscounted present value.\n◼ Cost approach: valuation techniques that reflect the current replacement cost of an asset at its current service capacity.\nEach valuation technique requires inputs that reflect the assumptions that buyers and sellers would use when pricing the\nasset or liability, including assumptions about risks. When selecting a valuation technique, the Group gives priority to those\ntechniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
