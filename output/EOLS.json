Jeuveau ® , our flagship brand, resonates with a younger generation of consumers, as demonstrated by the recent achievement of over one million total consumers enrolled in our loyalty program. Our deep customer engagement and cash-pay focus differentiate us in the category and pave the way for the upcoming launch of Evolysse™.” \n\n“Last week, we received approval for Estyme ® in the European Union, putting Evolus in a unique position as one of only five companies in Europe with both a neurotoxin and injectable HA gel line. We have initiated our early experience program and expect a full launch in the second half of 2025. Key learnings from Europe will inform the U.S. launch of our first two Evolysse™ injectable HA gels, Form and Smooth, which we anticipate will take place by September 2025, followed by Sculpt in 2026, and Lips in 2027. These launches will enable us to expand our market presence while benefiting from our existing infrastructure.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights and Recent Developments**\n\n  * The company’s key performance indicators demonstrated continued strong momentum during the third quarter. \n    * Evolus added over 600 new customer accounts in the quarter, bringing the total number of customers purchasing since launch to nearly 14,500. The reorder rate among customers was approximately 70% 2 . \n    * Members in the Evolus Rewards™ consumer loyalty program grew by over 72,000 to approximately 975,000 3 . As of November 2024, the Evolus Rewards™ consumer loyalty program has surpassed 1 million enrolled consumers. \n    * Total Evolus Rewards™ redemptions for the quarter hit an all-time high of over 190,000 3 with existing patients receiving repeat treatments at the rate of approximately 65%, which demonstrates growing consumer adoption and utilization. As of November 2024, total Evolus Rewards™ redemptions have surpassed 2 million reflective of sustained brand loyalty. \n    * Launched Club Evolus™, the first subscription-based program by a neurotoxin manufacturer, in early November. \n  * Evolus received approval for its Estyme ® injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) gels in the European Union, with an experience program to launch immediately, and full launch expected in the second half of 2025. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Total net revenues for the third quarter of 2024 increased 22% to $61.1 million from $50.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 driven primarily by higher volumes of Jeuveau ® . \n  * Gross profit margin and adjusted gross profit margin were 68.9% and 70.2%, respectively. Adjusted gross profit margin, which excludes amortization of intangible assets, aligns with company guidance for the full year, as noted below. \n  * Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $76.6 million, compared to $74.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $49.6 million, compared to $46.7 million in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude product cost of sales, stock-based compensation expense, revaluation of the contingent royalty obligation, and depreciation and amortization. \n  * Loss from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $15.5 million, compared to $7.7 million in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP loss from operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $6.7 million compared to a $1.1 million income from operations in the second quarter of 2024. The decline in operating income quarter over quarter was primarily driven by typical seasonality of revenue. Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations excludes stock-based compensation expense, revaluation of the contingent royalty obligation, and depreciation and amortization. \n  * Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 were $85.0 million compared to $93.7 million at June 30, 2024, representing a single-digit cash use for the quarter and continued progress toward cash generation. \n\n\n\n**Outlook**\n\n  * Evolus narrows its full year total net revenue guidance to $260 million to $266 million, representing year-over-year growth of 29% to 32% from 2023 results and well above the estimated growth rate of the aesthetic neurotoxin market. \n  * The company continues to expect its adjusted gross profit margin for the full year 2024 to be between 68% and 71%. \n  * Evolus continues to expect its full-year non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $185 million and $190 million. The company continues to expect to achieve positive non-GAAP operating income on a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of 2024 and for the full year 2025. \n  * PMA application for Evolysse ™ Form and Evolysse ™ Smooth injectable HA gels currently under review by the U.S. FDA with approval and launch expected by September 2025. \n  * The company projects total net revenue of at least $700 million by 2028, a compound annual growth rate of 28% from 2023, based on the combination of its existing aesthetic neurotoxin business and anticipated launch of the novel line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels beginning in 2025. \n  * Evolus continues to expect to expand operating margins by leveraging its highly synergistic, existing infrastructure, with a target of at least 20% by 2028. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nManagement will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss Evolus’ financial results today at 4:30 p.m. ET.

Within this press release, “profitability” is defined as achieving positive non-GAAP operating income. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for more information on the company’s use and definitions of non-GAAP measures. \n\n2  Represents cumulative statistics from the launch of Jeuveau ® in May 2019 through September 30, 2024. \n\n3 Represents cumulative statistics from the launch of Evolus Rewards ™ in May 2020 through September 30, 2024. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nEvolus’ financial results are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). This press release and the reconciliation tables included in the financial schedules below include adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations. Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross profit excluding amortization of an intangible asset. Adjusted gross profit margin is defined as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of total net revenues. Non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations exclude (i) product cost of sales, in the case of non-GAAP operating expenses only, (ii) the revaluation of contingent royalty obligations, (iii) stock-based compensation expense, and (iv) depreciation and amortization. Management believes that adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin are important measures for investors because management uses adjusted gross profit margin as a key performance indicator to evaluate the profitability of sales without giving effect to costs that are not core to our cost of sales, such as the amortization of an intangible asset. Management believes that non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations are useful in helping to identify the company’s core operating performance and enables management to consistently analyze the period-to-period financial performance of the core business operations. Management also believes that non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations will enable investors to assess the company in the same way that management has historically assessed the company’s operating expenses against comparable companies with conventional accounting methodologies. The company’s definitions of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations have limitations as analytical tools and may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered measures of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from such non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to financial statement data presented in the financial statements as an indicator of financial performance or liquidity. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. \n\nFor a reconciliation of our historical adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations presented herein to gross profit, gross profit margin, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP loss from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of Gross Profit Margin to Adjusted Gross Profit Margin,” “Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Expenses to Non-GAAP Operating Expenses” and “Reconciliation of GAAP (Loss) from Operations to Non-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations” in the financial schedules below. In addition, this press release includes information regarding the company’s expected adjusted gross profit margin and non-GAAP operating expenses for full year 2024 and the company’s expected non-GAAP operating income (loss) for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full year 2025. Evolus has not provided a reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating expenses or non-GAAP operating (loss) because a reconciliation of such measures to forward-looking GAAP gross profit margin, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP loss from operations, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, is not available without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various reconciling items that would impact the forward-looking outlook for these non-GAAP financial measures that have not yet occurred and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Such unavailable information could have a significant impact on Evolus’ GAAP financial results. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements about future events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, our industry and the regulatory environment in which we operate.

This certification marks a key regulatory milestone for Evolus, enabling it to commercially enter the dermal filler segment and doubling its addressable market outside the U.S. to $1.8 billion 1 . \n\nThe CE Mark certification, through the new MDR process represents more stringent requirements, designed to ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of medical devices sold in Europe. Achieving this certification demonstrates that the Estyme ® injectable HA gels meet the highest standards for product design, production, and performance. Evolus will introduce Estyme ® through a limited experience program with select physician partners. The limited experience program will allow Evolus to collaborate with leading aesthetic practitioners across Europe, gathering valuable insights to refine its broader launch strategy. A broader European launch is planned for the second half of 2025. \n\n“The MDR CE Mark certification for Estyme ® , is a critical milestone in our strategic path to expand our product portfolio and reflects our commitment to delivering high-quality gels that adhere to the most rigorous regulatory standards,” said David Moatazedi, President and Chief Executive Officer. “With Estyme ® , we are bringing a new level of excellence to the dermal filler category, as we grow our product portfolio to meet growing consumer demand for premium, cash-pay aesthetic treatments.” \n\nDr. Rui Avelar, Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&D, added, “We are proud that Estyme ® has achieved CE Mark certification under the MDR’s stringent standards, which reflects a commitment to the highest standards of patient safety and product efficacy. Estyme ®  is a differentiated line of injectable HA gels currently being studied globally and the first innovation breakthrough, with proprietary cold technology, in a decade. These gels utilize breakthrough cross-linking technology that better preserves the natural HA chain, which we believe will help distinguish it from other products in this category. Designed with the highest level of precision to meet the needs of both practitioners and patients, we look forward to seeing its positive impact on the European aesthetic market.” \n\nThe company remains on track for the U.S. approval and launch of the Evolysse ™ injectable HA gels beginning in 2025. \n\n**About Evolus, Inc.**\n\nEvolus (NASDAQ: EOLS) is a global performance beauty company evolving the aesthetic neurotoxin market for the next generation of beauty consumers through its unique, customer-centric business model and innovative digital platform.

Visit us at www.evolus.com, and follow us on LinkedIn, X, Instagram or Facebook.\n1 “Pro\u0000tability” is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. Within this press release, “pro\u0000tability” is\nde\u0000ned as achieving positive non-GAAP operating income. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for\nmore information on the company’s use and de\u0000nitions of non-GAAP measures.\n2 Represents cumulative statistics from the launch of Jeuveau ® in May 2019 through September 30, 2024.\n3 Represents cumulative statistics from the launch of Evolus Rewards ™ in May 2020 through September 30, 2024.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEvolus’ \u0000nancial results are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). This press release and the reconciliation tables included in the \u0000nancial schedules\nbelow include adjusted gross pro\u0000t, adjusted gross pro\u0000t margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP\nincome (loss) from operations. Adjusted gross pro\u0000t is calculated as gross pro\u0000t excluding amortization of an\nintangible asset. Adjusted gross pro\u0000t margin is de\u0000ned as adjusted gross pro\u0000t as a percentage of total net\nrevenues. Non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations exclude (i) product cost of\nsales, in the case of non-GAAP operating expenses only, (ii) the revaluation of contingent royalty obligations, (iii)\nstock-based compensation expense, and (iv) depreciation and amortization. Management believes that adjusted\ngross pro\u0000t and adjusted gross pro\u0000t margin are important measures for investors because management uses\nadjusted gross pro\u0000t margin as a key performance indicator to evaluate the pro\u0000tability of sales without giving\ne\u0000ect to costs that are not core to our cost of sales, such as the amortization of an intangible asset. Management\nbelieves that non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations are useful in helping to\nidentify the company’s core operating performance and enables management to consistently analyze the period-to-\nperiod \u0000nancial performance of the core business operations. Management also believes that non-GAAP operating\nexpenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations will enable investors to assess the company in the same\n4\nway that management has historically assessed the company’s operating expenses against comparable companies\nwith conventional accounting methodologies. The company’s de\u0000nitions of adjusted gross pro\u0000t, adjusted gross\npro\u0000t margin, non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations have limitations as\nanalytical tools and may di\u0000er from other companies reporting similarly named measures. Non-GAAP measures\nshould not be considered measures of \u0000nancial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from such non-\nGAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to \u0000nancial statement data presented in\nthe \u0000nancial statements as an indicator of \u0000nancial performance or liquidity. Non-GAAP measures should be\nconsidered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP but should not be considered a substitute for\nor superior to GAAP results.\nFor a reconciliation of our historical adjusted gross pro\u0000t, adjusted gross pro\u0000t margin, non-GAAP operating\nexpenses and non-GAAP income (loss) from operations presented herein to gross pro\u0000t, gross pro\u0000t margin, GAAP\noperating expenses and GAAP loss from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP \u0000nancial measures, please\nsee “Reconciliation of Gross Pro\u0000t Margin to Adjusted Gross Pro\u0000t Margin,” “Reconciliation of GAAP Operating\nExpenses to Non-GAAP Operating Expenses” and “Reconciliation of GAAP (Loss) from Operations to Non-GAAP\nIncome (Loss) from Operations” in the \u0000nancial schedules below. In addition, this press release includes\ninformation regarding the company’s expected adjusted gross pro\u0000t margin and non-GAAP operating expenses for\nfull year 2024 and the company’s expected non-GAAP operating income (loss) for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full\nyear 2025. Evolus has not provided a reconciliation of such forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted gross pro\u0000t margin,\nnon-GAAP operating expenses or non-GAAP operating (loss) because a reconciliation of such measures to forward-\nlooking GAAP gross pro\u0000t margin, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP loss from operations, respectively, the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP \u0000nancial measures, is not available without unreasonable e\u0000orts. This is due to the\ninherent di\u0000culty of forecasting the timing or amount of various reconciling items that would impact the forward-\nlooking outlook for these non-GAAP \u0000nancial measures that have not yet occurred and/or cannot be reasonably\npredicted. Such unavailable information could have a signi\u0000cant impact on Evolus’ GAAP \u0000nancial results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements as de\u0000ned under the Private Securities Litigation Reform\nAct of 1995 that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements about future events, our business, \u0000nancial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects, our industry and the regulatory environment in which we operate.\nAny statements contained herein that are not statements of historical or current facts are forward-looking\nstatements.

Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical or current\nfacts are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,”\n“expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would” or the negative of those terms, or other comparable terms\nintended to identify statements about the future. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates\nand projections, which we believe to be reasonable, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nexpressed in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are\nbeyond our control, include, but are not limited to, those made below under “Summary of Risk Factors” and in Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q.\nYou should carefully consider these risks, as well as the additional risks described in other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) in the future, including subsequent Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, which may from time to time\namend, supplement or supersede the risks and uncertainties we disclose. We also operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks\nemerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent\nto which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in, or implied by, any forward-looking\nstatements.\nIn light of the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be\nregarded as a representation by us or any other person that such results will be achieved, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-\nlooking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise the forward-looking statements\ncontained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q and the other documents we file with the SEC with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and\nachievements may be materially different from what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by the cautionary statements referenced\nabove.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves various risks and you are urged to carefully consider the risks discussed under Item 1A “Risk Factors,” in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q prior to making an investment in our securities. If any of the risks below or in Item 1A “Risk Factors” occurs, our business\ncould be materially and adversely affected. As more fully described in Item 1A “Risk Factors”, the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• We currently depend entirely on the successful marketing of our only commercial product, Jeuveau®. If we are unable to continue to successfully\nmarket and sell Jeuveau®, we may not generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\n• We have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the\nforeseeable future. We have only one approved product, which, together with our limited operating history, makes it difficult to assess our future\nviability.\n• We are reliant on Symatese to achieve regulatory approval for the Evolysse™ injectable hyaluronic acid product line in the United States. Failure to\nobtain approval or obtain approval on our estimated time frame for the Evolysse™ product line would negatively affect our ability to sell these\nproducts.\n• We may require additional financing to fund our future operations or execute corporate development activities, which could dilute the ownership\ninterest of our existing stockholders, and a failure to obtain additional capital when so needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay,\nlimit, reduce or terminate our operations.\n3\nTable of Contents\n• If we or our counterparties do not comply with the terms of our settlement agreements with Medytox, Inc. (“Medytox”), we may face litigation or lose\nour ability to market and sell Jeuveau®, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to carry out our business and our financial condition\nand ability to continue as a going concern.\n• The terms of the Settlement Agreement with Medytox will continue to reduce our profitability until the royalty payment obligations expire.\n• Our business, financial condition and operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by a public health crisis or contagious disease\noutbreak.\n• We rely on the license and supply agreement, as amended, with Daewoong, which we refer to as the Daewoong Agreement, to provide us with\nexclusive rights to distribute Jeuveau® in certain territories. Any termination or loss of significant rights, including exclusivity, under the Daewoong\nAgreement would materially and adversely affect our development and commercialization of Jeuveau®.\n• Our failure to successfully in-license, acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to\ngrow our business.\n• Jeuveau® faces, and any of our future product candidates will face, significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from\nmaintaining our market share and expansion.\n• Jeuveau® may fail to continue to achieve the broad degree of aesthetic practitioners adoption and use or consumer demand necessary for commercial\nsuccess.\n• Our ability to market Jeuveau® is limited to use for the treatment of glabellar lines, and if we want to expand the indications for which we market\nJeuveau®, we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals, which will be expensive and may not be granted.\n• Third party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our commercialization efforts and interrupt our supply of products.\n• If we or any of our current or future licensors, including Daewoong, are unable to maintain, obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to\nJeuveau® or any of our future product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\n• We may need to increase the size of our organization, including our sales and marketing capabilities, in order to further market and sell Jeuveau® and\nto commercialize any product candidates, if approved, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\n• We rely on our digital technology and applications and our business and operations could suffer in the event of information system failures or a\ncybersecurity incident.\n• We are subject to extensive government regulation, and we may face delays in or not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and our\ncompliance with ongoing regulatory requirements may result in significant additional expense, limit or delay regulatory approval or subject us to\npenalties if we fail to comply.\n• We currently rely solely on Daewoong to manufacture Jeuveau® and on Symatese to manufacture Evolysse™ and as such, any production or other\nproblems with either licensor could adversely affect us.\n• Future sales of our common stock by us or others, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nAdditional Information\nUnless the context indicates otherwise, as used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the terms “Evolus,” “company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Evolus,\nInc., a Delaware corporation, and our subsidiaries taken as a whole, unless otherwise noted.\n4\nTable of Contents\nEVOLUS®, Jeuveau®, Evolux® and Evolysse™ are trademarks of ours that are used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nEvolus, Inc., (“Evolus” or the “Company”) is a global performance beauty company focused on delivering products in the cash-pay aesthetic market. The\nCompany received the approval of its first product Jeuveau® (prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in February\n2019. The product was also approved by Health Canada in August 2018, the European Commission (“EC”) in September 2019, the Australian Therapeutics\nGood Administration (“TGA”) in January 2023, and Swissmedic in November 2023. Jeuveau® is a proprietary 900 kDa purified botulinum toxin type A\nformulation indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines, also known as “frown lines,” in adults. The\nCompany commercially launched Jeuveau® in the United States in May 2019, in Canada through a distribution partner in October 2019, and began its launch in\nEurope in September 2022 and Australia in July 2024. In 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to be the exclusive distributor of Evolysse™, a line of\ninjectable hyaluronic acid gels currently in late-stage development in the United States and Europe. In October 2024, regulatory approval was received in the\nEuropean Union for four products in the Evolysse™ line. The Company currently generates all of its net revenues from Jeuveau®. The Company is\nheadquartered in Newport Beach, California.\nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis that assumes that the Company will continue as a\ngoing concern. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Company’s assets and the satisfaction of the Company’s liabilities and commitments\nin the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects of the recoverability and classification of recorded\nasset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nSince inception, the Company has incurred recurring net operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities and management expects operating\nlosses and negative cash flows to continue for at least the next twelve months. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded\nloss from operations of $15,473 and $32,097, respectively, and a total net loss of $19,170 and $43,629, respectively. The Company used cash of $22,807 from\noperations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $85,035 in cash and cash equivalents and an\naccumulated deficit of $602,608.\nIn March 2024, the Company completed a follow-on offering and issued 3,554,000 shares of its common stock, at a price to the public of $14.07 per share. The\nCompany received net proceeds of $46,794 from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In\naddition, the Company granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to 533,100 additional shares of common stock (the “option\nshares”) at the purchase price. In April 2024, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase 318,100 of the allotted option shares. The net proceeds to the\nCompany from the sale of the option shares, after deducting the underwriters’ discounts and commissions, was $4,169.\nOn March 8, 2023, the Company entered into an “at-the-market” sales agreement (the “ATM Sales Agreement”) and filed a shelf registration statement on\nForm S-3 and corresponding prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to permit sales under the ATM Sales Agreement, which\nregistration statement became effective on June 8, 2023. The Company has not sold any shares under the ATM Sales Agreement. See Note 9. Stockholders’\nEquity for additional information.\nThe Company believes that its current capital resources, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund its operations through at least the\nnext twelve months from the date the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are issued based on its expected cash needs. The Company\nmay need to raise additional capital to fund future operations or execute corporate development activities through entering into licensing or collaboration\nagreements with partners, grants or other sources of financing. Sufficient funds may not be available to the Company at all or on attractive terms when needed\nfrom equity or debt financings. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding from these or other sources when needed, or to the extent needed, it may\nbe necessary to reduce its scope of operations to reduce the current rate\n12\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nof spending through actions such as reductions in staff and delaying, scaling back, or suspending certain research and development, sales and marketing\nprograms and other operational goals.\nNote 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a consistent basis with the annual financial statements and in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the requirements of the SEC for interim reporting.\nPursuant to these SEC rules and regulations, the Company has condensed or omitted certain financial information and disclosures normally included in annual\nfinancial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the opinion of management, the interim consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments,\nwhich include only normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the interim periods. The interim results presented herein are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 or for any other interim period.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures should be read in conjunction with the financial statements\nand notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of the Company’s wholly owned\nsubsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nManagement is required to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Such\nestimates and assumptions affect the reported consolidated financial statements. These estimates include, but are not limited to net revenues, allowance for\ndoubtful accounts, fair value measurements, inventory valuations and stock-based compensation, among others. Management bases estimates on historical\nexperience and on assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is party to an agreement (as amended, the “Daewoong Agreement”) with Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (“Daewoong”), pursuant to which\nthe Company received an exclusive distribution license to Jeuveau® from Daewoong for aesthetic indications in the United States, European Union, United\nKingdom, members of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as co-exclusive distribution\nrights with Daewoong in Japan. Jeuveau® is manufactured by Daewoong in a facility in South Korea. The Company also has the option to negotiate first with\nDaewoong to secure a distribution license for any product that Daewoong directly or indirectly develops or commercializes that is classified as an injectable\nbotulinum toxin (other than Jeuveau®) in a territory covered by the Daewoong Agreement. The Company relies on Daewoong, its exclusive and sole supplier,\nto manufacture Jeuveau®. Any termination or loss of significant rights, including exclusivity, under the Daewoong Agreement would materially and adversely\naffect the Company’s commercialization of Jeuveau®. See Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies and Note 10. Medytox Settlement Agreements for additional\ninformation.\nThe Company commercially launched Jeuveau® in the United States in May 2019 and in Canada through its distribution partner in October 2019. The\nCompany also began commercially launching Jeuveau® in Europe in September 2022 and in Australia in July 2024 and, as such, has a limited history of sales\nin those markets. If any previously granted approval to market and sell Jeuveau® is retracted or the Company is denied approval or approval is delayed by\nregulators in any other jurisdictions, it may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and its consolidated financial statements.\n13\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company is also subject to risks common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, dependency on the commercial\nsuccess of Jeuveau®, the Company’s sole commercial product, significant competition within the medical aesthetics industry, its ability to maintain regulatory\napproval of Jeuveau®, its ability to obtain regulatory approval for Evolysse™, third party litigation and challenges to its intellectual property, uncertainty of\nbroad adoption of its product by aesthetic practitioners and patients, its ability to in-license, acquire or develop additional product candidates and to obtain the\nnecessary approvals for those product candidates, and the need to scale manufacturing capabilities over time.\nAny disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, including caused by other events, such as public health crises, increased inflation and rising interest\nrates, and geopolitical conflicts, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, may increase the\nCompany’s cost of capital and adversely affect its ability to access financing when and on terms that the Company desires. Any of these events could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief\noperating decision-maker. The Company has determined that it operates in a single operating and reportable segment. The Company’s chief operating decision\nmaker is its Chief Executive Officer who manages operations and reviews the financial information as a single operating segment for the purposes of allocating\nresources and evaluating its financial performance.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s cash is held by financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. Such deposits may, at times,\nexceed federally insured limits. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses associated with this credit risk and continues to believe that this exposure\nis not significant. The Company invests, or plans to soon invest, its excess cash, in line with its investment policy, primarily in money market funds and debt\ninstruments of U.S. government agencies.\nThe Company’s accounts receivable is derived from customers located principally in the United States. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade\nreceivables are limited due to the Company’s credit evaluation process. The Company does not typically require collateral from its customers. Credit losses\nhistorically have not been material. The Company continuously monitors customer payments and maintains an allowance for credit losses based on its\nassessment of various factors including historical experience, age of the receivable balances, and other current economic conditions or other factors that may\naffect customers’ ability to pay.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with remaining maturities at purchase of three months or less that can be liquidated\nwithout prior notice or penalty. Cash and cash equivalents may include deposits, money market funds and debt securities. Amounts receivable from credit card\nissuers are typically converted to cash within two to four days of the original sales transaction and are considered to be cash equivalents.\nInventories\nInventories consist of finished goods held for sale and distribution. Cost is determined based on the estimated amount payable to the Company’s supplier, using\nthe first-in, first-out method with prioritization of the items with the earliest expiration dates. Inventory valuation reserves are established based on a number of\nfactors including, but not limited to, finished goods not meeting product specifications, product excess and obsolescence, or application of the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value concepts. The determination of events requiring the establishment of inventory valuation reserves, together with the calculation of the\namount of such reserves may require judgment. No material inventory valuation reserves have been recorded for the periods presented. Adverse changes in\nassumptions utilized in the Company’s inventory reserve calculations could result in an increase to its inventory valuation reserves.\n14\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nProduct cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, consisted of the inventory cost and certain royalties on the sale of Jeuveau® payable to\nMedytox pursuant to the Medytox Settlement Agreements (as such term is defined in Note 10. Medytox Settlement Agreements).\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants in a principal market on the measurement date.\nThe fair value hierarchy defines a three-tiered valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement is classified and disclosed by the Company in\none of the three categories as follows:\n• Level 1—Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\n• Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active\nmarkets; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\n• Level 3—Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are unobservable that are supported by little or no market activity and that are\nsignificant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe categorization of a financial instrument within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\napproximately three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the term of the\nrelated lease.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. The\nCompany assesses goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not\nbe recoverable. The Company performs an annual qualitative assessment of its goodwill in the fourth quarter of each calendar year to determine if any events\nor circumstances exist, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry demand, that would indicate that it would more likely\nthan not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount, including goodwill. If events or circumstances do not indicate that the fair value of\na reporting unit is below its carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered to be impaired and no further testing is required. For the purpose of impairment\ntesting, the Company has determined that it has one reporting unit. There was no impairment of goodwill for any of the periods presented.\nIntangible Assets\nThe distribution right intangible asset related to Jeuveau® is amortized over the period the asset is expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the\nCompany. The Company determined the pattern of this intangible asset’s future cash flows could not be readily determined with a high level of precision. As a\nresult, the distribution right intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 20 years.\nOn December 20, 2023, the Company entered into a License, Supply and Distribution Agreement (the “Symatese Europe Agreement”), pursuant to which\nSymatese granted to the Company an exclusive right to commercialize and distribute four injectable hyaluronic acid product candidates, which are referred to\nas: (i) Form; (ii) Smooth; (iii) Sculpt and (iv) Lips, in 50 countries in Europe for use in the aesthetics and dermatological fields. A portion of the Symatese\nEurope Agreement represents the license and distribution right to Evolysse™ in Europe. The definite-lived distribution right intangible asset\n15\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nrelated to the Evolysse™ nasolabial fold product approved in Europe is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 15 years.\nThe Company capitalizes certain internal-use software costs associated with the development of its mobile and web-based customer platforms. These costs\ninclude personnel expenses and external costs that are directly associated with the software projects. These costs are included as intangible assets in the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized internal-use software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated\nuseful life of two years upon being placed in service.\nThe Company reviews long-term and identifiable definite-lived intangible assets or asset groups for impairment when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the\ncarrying amount of the asset or an asset group, further impairment analysis is performed. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying\namount of the asset or asset groups exceeds the fair value for assets to be held and used or fair value less cost to sell for assets to be disposed of. The Company\nalso reviews the useful lives of its assets periodically to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. Changes in\nthe useful life are adjusted prospectively by revising the remaining period over which the asset is amortized. There was no material impairment of long-lived\nassets for any periods presented.\nLeases\nAt the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether the contract contains a lease by assessing whether there is an identified asset\nand whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met,\nupon lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability which represents the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease,\nand a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset which represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term. Operating lease assets\nand liabilities are included in ROU assets, current portion of operating lease liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at\ncommencement date calculated using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate applicable to the underlying asset unless the implicit rate is readily\ndeterminable. The incremental borrowing rate, the ROU asset and the lease liability are reevaluated upon a lease modification. Operating lease ROU assets also\ninclude any lease payments made at or before lease commencement and exclude any lease incentives received, if any. The Company determines the lease term\nas the noncancelable period of the lease and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise\nsuch options. The Company’s leases do not contain any residual value guarantees. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. For operating leases, the Company recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. There were no significant\nfinance leases as of September 30, 2024.\nContingent Royalty Obligation Payable to Evolus Founders\nPayment obligations to the founders of Evolus (“Evolus Founders”) consist of quarterly royalty payments of a low-single digit percentage of net sales of\nJeuveau®. The obligations terminate in the second quarter of 2029, which is the 10-year anniversary of the first commercial sale of Jeuveau® in the United\nStates. Under an amended agreement with the Evolus Founders, the Company recorded the fair value of all revised payment obligations owed to the Evolus\nFounders.\nThe Company determines the fair value of the contingent royalty obligation payable at each reporting period end based on Level 3 inputs using a discounted\ncash flows method. Changes in the fair value of the contingent royalty obligation payable are determined at each reporting period end and recorded in operating\nexpenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and as a liability in the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nLong-Term Debt\nLong-term debt represents the debt balance with Pharmakon (see Note 6. Term Loans), net of discount and issuance costs. Debt issuance costs represent legal,\nlender and consulting costs or fees associated with debt financing. Debt discounts and issuance costs are amortized into interest expense over the term of the\ndebt.\n16\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S.\ndollars at current exchange rates as of balance sheet date, and income and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars using the average rates of exchange\nprevailing during the period. Gains and losses arising from translation are recorded in other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’\nequity. Foreign currency gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the Company’s functional currency are recorded in other\nexpenses, net in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to\nwhich the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services. In order to achieve that core principle, a five-step approach is applied: (1)\nidentify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction\nprice to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue allocated to each performance obligation when the Company satisfies the\nperformance obligation. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for\nrevenue recognition.\nGeneral\nThe Company generates product revenue from the sale of Jeuveau® in the United States, Europe and Australia, and service revenue from the sale of Jeuveau®\nthrough a distribution partner in Canada.\nFor product revenue, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods under a contract is transferred to a customer, in an amount that\nreflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods as specified in the customer contract. The transfer of control occurs upon\nreceipt of the goods by the customer since that is when the customer has obtained control of the goods’ economic benefits. The Company does not provide any\nservice-type warranties and does not accept product returns except under limited circumstances such as damages in transit or ineffective product. The Company\nalso excludes any amounts related to taxes assessed by governmental authorities from revenue measurement. Shipping and handling costs associated with\noutbound product freight are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nFor service revenue, the Company evaluated the arrangement with the distribution partner in Canada and determined that it acts as an agent in the distribution\nof Jeuveau® in Canada as it does not control the product before control is transferred to a customer. The indicators of which party exercises control include\nprimary responsibility over performance obligations, inventory risk before the good or service is transferred and discretion in establishing the price.\nAccordingly, the Company records the sale as service revenue on a net basis. Revenue from services is recognized in the period the service is performed for the\namount of consideration expected to be received.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company’s disaggregation of revenue is consistent with its operating segment as disclosed above.\nGross-to-Net Revenue Adjustments\nThe Company provides customers with discounts, such as trade and volume discounts and prompt pay discounts, that are directly reflected in the invoice price.\nRevenues are recorded net of sales-related adjustments, wherever applicable, primarily for the volume-based rebates, consumer loyalty programs and co-\nbranded marketing programs.\n• Volume-Based Rebates — Volume-based rebates are contractually offered to certain customers. The rebates payable to each customer are determined\nbased on the contract and quarterly purchase volumes.\n• Consumer Loyalty Program — The Company’s consumer loyalty program allows participating customers to earn rewards for qualifying treatments to\ntheir patients (i.e. consumers) using Jeuveau® and redeem the rewards for Jeuveau® in the future at no additional cost. The loyalty program represents\na customer option that provides a\n17\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nmaterial right and, accordingly, is a performance obligation. At the time Jeuveau® product is sold to customers, the invoice price is allocated between\nthe product sold and the estimated material right reward (“Reward”) that the customer might redeem in the future. The standalone selling price of the\nReward is measured based on estimated average selling price of Jeuveau® at the time of redemption and the expected redemption rate by customers\nbased on historical sales data. The portion of invoice price allocated to the Reward is initially recorded as deferred revenue. Subsequently, when\ncustomers redeem the Reward and the related product is delivered, the deferred revenue is recognized in net revenues at that time.\n• Co-Branded Marketing Programs — The Company offers eligible customers with a certain level of Jeuveau® purchases to receive advertising co-\nbranded with the Company. The co-branded advertising represents a performance obligation. At the time Jeuveau® product is sold to customers, the\ninvoice price is allocated between the product sold and the advertisement. The standalone selling price of the advertisement is measured based on the\nestimated market value of similar advertisement adjusted for the customer’s portion of the advertisement. The portion of invoice price allocated to the\nadvertisement is initially recorded as deferred revenue. Subsequently, when the advertisement airs, the deferred revenue is recognized in net revenues\nat that time.\nContract Balances\nA contract with a customer states the terms of the sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product purchased. Amounts are recorded as\naccounts receivable when the Company’s right to consideration becomes unconditional. The Company does not have any significant financing components in\ncustomer contracts given the expected time between transfer of the promised products and the payment of the associated consideration is less than one year. As\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all amounts included in accounts receivable, net on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets\nare related to contracts with customers.\nThe Company did not have any contract assets nor unbilled receivables as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nContract liabilities reflect estimated amounts that the Company is obligated to pay to customers or patients primarily under the rebate and deferred revenue\nassociated with Rewards under the consumer loyalty program and co-branded marketing programs. The Company’s contract liabilities are included in accounts\npayable and accrued expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accrued revenue contract liabilities, primarily related to volume-based rebates, consumer loyalty\nprogram and co-branded marketing programs, were $13,231 and $11,033, respectively, which were recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, provisions for rebate, consumer loyalty programs and co-branded marketing programs were $8,732\nand $26,728, respectively which were offset by related payments, redemptions and adjustments of $7,226 and $24,514, respectively, which were recorded as\nadjustments to gross revenues in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nprovisions for rebate, consumer loyalty programs and co-branded marketing programs were $6,762 and $22,264, respectively, which were offset by related\npayments, redemptions and adjustments of $6,924 and $22,495, respectively, which were recorded as adjustments to gross revenues in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statement of operations.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $10,078 and $7,751, respectively, of revenue related to amounts\nincluded in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period and did not recognize any revenue related to changes in transaction prices regarding its contracts\nwith customers from previous periods.\nCollectability\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. At the time of contract inception or new customer account set-up, the\nCompany performs a collectability assessment of the customer’s creditworthiness. The Company assesses the probability that the Company will collect the\nentitled consideration in exchange for the goods sold, by considering the customer’s ability and intention to pay when consideration is due. The Company’s\nexpected loss allowance methodology for accounts receivable is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic and market\nconditions and periodic evaluation of customers’ receivables balances using relevant available information, from\n18\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\ninternal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for estimation of\nexpected credit losses and are adjusted as necessary using the relevant information available. The Company writes off accounts receivable balances when it is\ndetermined that there is no possibility of collection. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, allowance for credit losses was $2,282 and $1,490,\nrespectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the provision for bad debts was $889 and $1,659, respectively, and write-offs, net of\nrecoveries was $665 and $866, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the provision for bad debts was $1,012 and $1,354,\nrespectively, and the write-offs, net of recoveries was $1,057 and $955, respectively.\nPractical Expedients\nThe Company expenses sales commissions when incurred as the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and\nadministrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company does not adjust the\namount of promised consideration for the effects of the time value of money for contracts in which the anticipated period between when the Company transfers\nthe goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays within one year.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include personnel-related costs, costs associated with pre-\nclinical and clinical development activities, costs associated with and costs for prototype products that are manufactured prior to market approval for that\nprototype product, internal and external costs associated with the Company’s regulatory compliance and quality assurance functions, including the costs of\noutside consultants and contractors that assist in the process of submitting and maintaining regulatory filings, and overhead costs, including allocated facility\nrelated expenses.\nIn-process Research and Development\nIntangible assets acquired that are used for research and development, do not yet have regulatory approval for commercialization, and have no future\nalternative use are expensed as in-process research and development.\nSymatese U.S. Agreement\nOn May 9, 2023, the Company and Symatese entered into a License, Supply and Distribution Agreement (the “Symatese U.S. Agreement”), pursuant to which\nSymatese granted to the Company an exclusive right to commercialize and distribute its five injectable hyaluronic acid product candidates, including the\nproducts referred to as: (i) Form; (ii) Smooth; (iii) Sculpt; (iv) Lips; and (v) Eye (collectively, the “Products”), in the United States for use in the aesthetics and\ndermatological field of use. The Company also has the right of first negotiation to obtain a license from Symatese to commercialize and distribute any new\nproducts developed using the same technology as the Evolysse™ line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels.\nAs consideration for the rights granted under the Symatese U.S. Agreement, the Company is required to make up to €16,200 in milestone payments to\nSymatese, including an initial payment of €4,100 within 30 days of execution of the Symatese U.S. Agreement, and additional annual payments of €1,600 in\nJune 2025, €4,100 in June 2026, €3,200 in June 2027, and €3,200 in June 2028, in each case subject to three of the Products gaining approval prior to that date.\nIn June 2023, the Company paid $4,441 as an upfront payment upon the signing of the Symatese U.S. Agreement and has developmental costs, ongoing\nmilestone and royalty payment obligations. The Symatese U.S. Agreement is also subject to minimum purchase requirements and failure to meet such\nrequirements may result in a reduction or termination of the Company’s exclusive rights, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, the Company agreed to a\nspecified cost-sharing agreement with Symatese related to the registration of the Lips and Eye Products with the FDA.\nThe initial term of the Symatese U.S. Agreement is fifteen (15) years from the first FDA approval of a Product, with automatic renewals for successive five (5)-\nyear terms subject to the terms of the Symatese U.S. Agreement. The upfront payment of $4,441 was recorded as in-process research and development expense.\nSymatese Europe Agreement\n19\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nOn December 20, 2023, the Company entered into the Symatese Europe Agreement, pursuant to which Symatese granted to us an exclusive right to\ncommercialize and distribute four injectable hyaluronic acid gel candidates, which are referred to as: (i) Form; (ii) Smooth; (iii) Sculpt and (iv) Lips, in 50\ncountries in Europe for use in the aesthetics and dermatological fields.\nIn exchange for the rights granted under the Symatese Europe Agreement, the Company issued 610,000 shares of common stock and is required to pay two\nmilestone payments: (i) €1,200 on the second anniversary of certain regulatory approvals, and (ii) €1,900 on the earlier of the third anniversary of certain\nregulatory approvals or following a year in which the Company achieves €25,000 in revenue in Europe. In October 2024, regulatory approval was received in\nthe European Union for four products in the Evolysse™ line. The Symatese Europe Agreement is also subject to minimum purchase requirements and failure to\nmeet such requirements may result in a reduction or termination of the Company’s exclusive rights, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe initial agreement is for a term of fifteen (15) years, with automatic year renewal provisions. Upon the receiving of regulatory approval for the Evolysse™\nnasolabial fold product in Europe, the Company recorded $4,429 in in-process research and development expense and $1,476 in intangible assets in December\n2023 for the stock issuance of 610,000 shares. The intangible assets of $1,476 represents the value of the approved nasolabial fold product in Europe and is\namortized over its estimated useful life.\nLitigation Settlement\nIn connection with a litigation settlement, $5,000 was paid in the first quarter of 2023 and for the period from September 17, 2022 to September 16, 2032, the\nCompany agreed to pay Medytox a mid-single digit royalty percentage on all net sales of Jeuveau®. The royalty payments are made quarterly and recorded as\nproduct cost of sales on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the periods the royalties are incurred.\nSee Note 10. Medytox Settlement Agreements for the details of all litigation settlement agreements.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for employees, consultants and members of the Board of Directors based on the fair value at the\ndate of grant.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value stock option grants. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of\nsubjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, expected risk-free interest rate, and the option’s expected life. The\nfair value of the Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is based on the fair value on the grant date of the Company’s common stock. The Company also\nevaluates the impact of modifications made to the original terms of equity awards when they occur.\nThe Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of performance units with market conditions at the grant date. The Monte Carlo\nsimulation model involves the generation of a large number of possible stock price outcomes for the Company’s stock which is assumed to follow a Geometric\nBrownian Motion. The use of the Monte Carlo simulation model requires the input of a number of assumptions including expected volatility of the Company’s\nstock price, which is based on the historical volatility of its stock; risk-free interest rate, which is based on the treasury zero-coupon yield commensurate with\nthe term of the performance unit as of the grant date; and expected dividends as applicable, which is zero, as the Company has never paid any cash dividends.\nThe fair value of stock options and RSUs with service conditions that are expected to vest is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nStock-based compensation for RSUs with performance or market conditions is recorded over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution\nmethod. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation for RSUs with performance conditions when it is probable that those performance conditions will\nbe met. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized net of actual forfeitures when they occur, as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets and in the selling, general and administrative or research and development expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss.\n20\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company applies an estimated annual effective tax rate (“ETR”) approach for calculating a tax provision or benefit for interim periods, as required under\nGAAP. The Company recorded an income tax expense of $134 and $24 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and an income\ntax expense of $224 and $70 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company’s ETR differs from the U.S. federal statutory\ntax rate of 21% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, primarily as a result of the impact of the change of the valuation allowance\nto offset its deferred tax assets.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a\ndeferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the\namount of the valuation allowance. When the Company establishes or reduces the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, its provision for income\ntaxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.\nAdditionally, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a\nparticular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. Accordingly, the Company establishes reserves\nfor uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company monitors changes to the tax laws in the states it conducts business and files corporate income tax returns. The Company does not expect that\nchanges to state tax laws through September 30, 2024 to materially impact its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNet Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period\nincluding contingently issuable shares. Diluted earnings per share is based on the treasury stock method and includes the effect from potential issuance of\nordinary shares, such as shares issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units. Because the impact of the options and\nnon-vested RSUs are anti-dilutive during periods of net loss, there was no difference between the weighted-average number of shares used to calculate basic\nand diluted net loss per common share for the periods presented. Excluded from the dilutive net loss per share computation for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 were stock options of 6,188,670 and 5,810,702, respectively, and non-vested RSUs of 4,117,747 and 4,035,380, respectively,\nbecause their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Although these securities were anti-dilutive for these periods, they could be dilutive in future periods.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This update requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as\nwell as information on income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for public entities with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early\nadoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This update\nrequires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis.\nPublic entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures\nand reconciliation requirements in ASC 280, on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and\nfor interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n21\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants, and the SEC did not, or are not believed by management to, have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial position, results\nof operations or cash flows.\nNote 3. Fair Value Measurements\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company measures and reports certain financial instruments as assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of these instruments\nwas as follows:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLiabilities\nContingent royalty obligation payable to Evolus Founders $ 45,029 $ — $ — $ 45,029\nAs of December 31, 2023\nFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLiabilities\nContingent royalty obligation payable to Evolus Founders $ 45,030 $ — $ — $ 45,030\nThe Company did not transfer any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis between levels during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 or 2023.\nThe Company determines the fair value of the contingent royalty obligation payable to Evolus Founders based on Level 3 inputs using a discounted cash flows\nmethod. The significant unobservable input assumptions that can significantly change the fair value include (i) projected amount and timing of net revenues\nduring the payment period, which terminates at the end of the second quarter of 2029, (ii) the discount rate, and (iii) the timing of payments. As of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company utilized a discount rate of 14.0% and 15.0%, respectively. Net revenue projections are also updated to reflect\nchanges in the timing of expected sales. Significant increases (decreases) in the discount rate and to the projected net revenues would result in a significantly\nlower (higher) fair value measurement, which could materially impact their fair value reported on the unaudited consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending fair value measurements of the contingent royalty obligation payable:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFair value, beginning of period $ 44,606 $ 47,081 $ 45,030 $ 46,310\nPayments (2,005) (1,479) (5,612) (4,038)\nChange in fair value recorded in operating expenses 2,428 1,802 5,611 5,132\nFair value, end of period $ 45,029 $ 47,404 $ 45,029 $ 47,404\nOther Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, lease liabilities,\nand long-term debt. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair\nvalue because of the short-term maturity of such instruments.\n22\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company estimates the fair value of long-term debt and operating lease liabilities using the discounted cash flow analysis based on the interest rates for\nsimilar rated debt securities (Level 2). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of long-term debt was $138,501 and $140,241,\nrespectively. The fair value of operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 approximated their carrying value.\nNote 4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe table below shows the weighted-average life, original cost, accumulated amortization and net book value by major intangible asset classification:\nWeighted-Average Life Accumulated\n(Years) Original Cost Amortization Net Book Value\nDefinite-lived intangible assets\nDistribution rights 20 $ 60,552 $ (16,791) $ 43,761\nCapitalized software 2 12,397 (9,571) 2,826\nIntangible assets, net 72,949 (26,362) 46,587\nIndefinite-lived intangible asset\nGoodwill * 21,208 — 21,208\nTotal as of September 30, 2024 $ 94,157 $ (26,362) $ 67,795\nWeighted-Average Life Accumulated\n(Years) Original Cost Amortization Net Book Value\nDefinite-lived intangible assets\nDistribution rights 20 $ 60,552 $ (14,500) $ 46,052\nCapitalized software 2 9,804 (8,746) 1,058\nIntangible assets, net 70,356 (23,246) 47,110\nIndefinite-lived intangible asset\nGoodwill * 21,208 — 21,208\nTotal as of December 31, 2023 $ 91,564 $ (23,246) $ 68,318\n* Intangible assets with indefinite lives have an indeterminable average life.\nThe following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets held as of September 30, 2024 that are subject to\namortization:\nFiscal year\nRemaining in 2024 $ 1,019\n2025 4,498\n2026 4,179\n2027 3,054\n2028 3,054\nThereafter 30,783\n$ 46,587\nThe Company capitalized $1,116 and $349 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2,593 and $919 for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to costs of computer software developed for internal use. The software is amortized over a two-year\nperiod using the straight-line method. The Company recorded total intangible assets amortization expense of $803 and $1,053 for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and\n23\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\n2023, respectively, and $3,115 and $3,005 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, within depreciation and amortization on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNote 5. Accrued Expenses\nAccrued expenses consisted of:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAccrued revenue contract liabilities $ 13,231 $ 11,033\nAccrued payroll and related benefits 10,907 13,433\nAccrued royalties under the Medytox Settlement Agreement 3,658 3,657\nOther accrued expenses 7,153 5,690\n$ 34,949 $ 33,813\nNote 6. Term Loans\nPharmakon Term Loans\nOn December 14, 2021, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Pharmakon. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Pharmakon agreed to make term\nloans to the Company in two tranches (the “Pharmakon Term Loans”). The first tranche of $75,000 was funded on December 29, 2021. On December 5, 2022,\nthe Company entered into a Second Amendment to the loan agreement to extend the Company’s option to draw down the second tranche of $50,000 until\nDecember 31, 2023, and paid an amendment fee of $500 to Pharmakon. The Pharmakon Term Loans will mature on the sixth-year anniversary of the closing\ndate of the first tranche (the “Maturity Date”).\nOn May 9, 2023, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the loan agreement. Under the Third Amendment, Pharmakon agreed to advance the\nsecond tranche of $50,000 to the Company in two installments: (i) $25,000 advanced on May 31, 2023 and (ii) $25,000 advanced on December 15, 2023. The\nThird Amendment amended the principal payment terms to seven quarterly payments, each in an amount equal to 1/12th of the outstanding principal amount of\nthe Pharmakon Term Loans following the 51st-month anniversary of the closing date of the first tranche and the remaining principal balance of the Pharmakon\nTerm Loans on the Maturity Date. The Third Amendment replaced the interest rates based on London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) with interest rates\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) throughout the remaining term of the Pharmakon Term Loans.\nInitially, the Pharmakon Term Loans accrued interest at a per annum rate equal to the 3-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR rate (subject to a LIBOR rate floor of 1.0%)\nplus 8.5% per annum. Beginning May 2023, the Pharmakon Term Loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the 3-month SOFR rate (subject to a SOFR\nrate floor of 1.0%) plus 8.5% per annum.\nThe Company may elect to prepay all amounts, not less than $20,000, owed prior to the Maturity Date. Prepayments of the second tranche installment prior to\nthe second anniversary of the date on which the second tranche installment is drawn by the Company will be accompanied by a make whole amount equal to\nthe sum of all interest that would have accrued through such second anniversary. Prepayments of the Pharmakon Term Loans will also be accompanied by a\nprepayment premium equal to the principal amount so prepaid multiplied by 3.0% if made prior to the third anniversary of the closing date of the first tranche,\n2.0% if made on or after the third anniversary of the closing date of the first tranche but prior to the fourth anniversary of the closing date of the first tranche,\nand 1.0% if made on or after the fourth anniversary of the closing date of the first tranche but prior to the Maturity Date. If the Pharmakon Term Loans are\naccelerated following the occurrence of an event of default, including a material adverse change, the Company is required to immediately pay Pharmakon an\namount equal to the sum of all outstanding principal, unpaid interest, and applicable make whole and prepayment premiums.\nThe Pharmakon Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The Pharmakon Term Loans contain customary affirmative and restrictive\ncovenants and representations and warranties. The affirmative covenants include, among others, certain information delivery requirements, obligations to\nmaintain certain insurance, and certain notice requirements. The restrictive covenants include, among others, incurring certain additional indebtedness,\nconsummating\n24\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\ncertain change in control transactions, or incurring any non- permitted lien or other encumbrance on the Company’s assets, without Pharmakon’s prior written\nconsent. The Pharmakon Term Loans do not contain covenants requiring the Company to maintain a minimum cash threshold or minimum revenues or\nearnings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants.\nAt the closing date of the first tranche, the Company incurred $3,042 and $3,263 in debt discounts and issuance costs related to the Pharmakon Term Loans,\nrespectively. Debt discounts and issuance costs related to the entire Pharmakon Term Loans have been allocated pro rata between the funded and unfunded\nportions. Debt discounts and issuance costs allocated to the first tranche of $75,000 have been presented as a deduction to the debt balance and amortized into\ninterest expense using the effective interest method. Debt discounts and issuance costs associated with the unfunded second tranche are deferred as assets until\nthe tranche is drawn and are amortized into interest expense using the straight-line method over the term of the debt. Upon the first draw of the second tranche\nin May 2023, debt discounts and issuance costs associated with the second tranche were reclassified from assets to debt as a deduction to the debt balance.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the borrowings outstanding under the Pharmakon Term Loans were classified as long-term debt in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. The overall effective interest rate was approximately 15.27% and 13.95% for the first and second tranche, respectively, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the principal amounts of long-term debt maturities for each of the next five fiscal years are as follows:\nFiscal year\n2026 $ 41,667\n2027 83,333\nTotal principal payments 125,000\nUnamortized debt discounts and issuance costs (3,792)\nLong term debt, net of discounts and issuance costs $ 121,208\nNote 7. Operating Leases\nOn May 15, 2019, the Company entered into a five-year non-cancelable operating lease (the “Lease Agreement”), which was set to expire January 31, 2025, for\nits corporate headquarters in Newport Beach, California. Lease payments increase each year on February 1 based on an annual rent escalation clause. The\nCompany has an option to extend the term of the lease for an additional 60 months, which was not recognized as part of its ROU assets and lease liabilities.\nOn July 27, 2023, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Lease Agreement (the “First Lease Amendment”) for its corporate headquarters. The\nFirst Lease Amendment includes a lease extension to January 31, 2030 with a three-month rent abatement period and additional office space. On July 27, 2023,\nthe effective date of the First Lease Amendment, the Company recognized additional ROU assets and lease liabilities in the amount of $4,550. On August 1,\n2024, the lease commencement date for the additional office space, the Company recognized additional ROU assets and lease liabilities in the amount of\n$3,002.\nOn October 16, 2024, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Lease Agreement (the “Second Lease Amendment”) to acquire additional office\nspace for its corporate headquarters.\nThe Company’s lease agreement does not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The payments associated with the renewal\nwill only be included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU assets if the exercise of the renewal option is determined to be reasonably certain. The\nCompany considers the timing of the renewal period and other economic factors such as the financial implications of a decision to extend or not to extend a\nlease in determining if the renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised.\n25\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThe components of operating lease expense are as follows:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended\n30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFixed operating lease expense $ 387 $ 286 $ 1,055 $ 833\nVariable operating lease expense 26 48 96 110\n$ 413 $ 334 $ 1,151 $ 943\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate are as follows:\nAs of September 30,\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 5.3 6.3\nWeighted-average discount rate 9.6 % 11.0 %\nOperating lease expenses were included in the selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss.

Commitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has entered into commitments to purchase services and products for an aggregate amount of approximately $4,652.\nCertain minimum purchase commitments related to the purchase of Jeuveau® and Evolysse™ are described below.\nDaewoong Agreement\nThe Daewoong Agreement includes certain minimum annual purchases that the Company is required to make in order to maintain the exclusivity of the license.\nThe Company may, however, meet these minimum purchase obligations by achieving certain market share in the licensed territories. These potential minimum\npurchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and the Company’s future market share\nin various jurisdictions.\n26\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nTotal inventory payments to Daewoong were $17,648 and $44,268 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $8,785 and\n$36,537 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nSymatese U.S. Agreement and Symatese Europe Agreement\nThe Symatese U.S. Agreement and the Symatese Europe Agreement include certain minimum purchase requirements, and failure to meet such requirements\nmay result in a reduction or termination of the Company’s rights to exclusivity, subject to certain exceptions. These potential minimum purchase obligations are\ncontingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and the Company’s future market share in various jurisdictions.\nLegal Proceedings\nSecurities Class Action Lawsuit\nOn October 16 and 28, 2020, two putative securities class action complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by\nEvolus shareholders Armin Malakouti and Clinton Cox, respectively, naming the Company and certain of its officers as defendants. The complaints assert\nviolations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, claiming that the defendants made false\nand materially misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts related to the Company’s acquisition of the right to sell Jeuveau®, the\ncomplaint against the Company filed by Allergan and Medytox in the U.S. International Trade Commission related to Jeuveau® (the “ITC Action”), and risks\nrelated to the ITC Action. The complaints assert a putative class period of February 1, 2019 to July 6, 2020. The court consolidated the actions on November\n13, 2020, under the caption In re Evolus Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 1:20-cv-08647 (PGG). On September 17, 2021, the court appointed a lead plaintiff and\nlead counsel. On November 17, 2021, the lead plaintiff filed an amended class action complaint against the Company, three of its officers, and Alphaeon\nCorporation, the Company’s former majority shareholder. On January 18, 2022, the Company and the officer defendants served their motion to dismiss the\namended complaint. The motion was fully briefed on June 16, 2022.\nOn September 26, 2024, the court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint and provided plaintiffs with the ability to move to amend\ntheir complaint by October 17, 2024. Plaintiffs did not submit a motion to amend their complaint by October 17, 2024, and on October 18, 2024, the court\nentered final judgment in favor of the defendants. Plaintiffs’ deadline to file a notice of appeal is November 18, 2024. The outcome of the legal proceeding is\nuncertain at this point. Based on information available to the Company at present, management cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss with respect to this\nmatter.\nShareholder Derivative Lawsuit\nOn November 27, 2020 and December 2, 2020, two putative Evolus shareholders filed substantially similar shareholder derivative actions in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York against certain of the Company’s officers and directors as defendants. The complaints alleged substantially similar\nfacts as those in the Securities Class Action and assert claims for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment,\nand violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and for contribution under Sections 10(b) and 21(D) of the Exchange Act. On December 29, 2020, the\nplaintiffs filed a joint stipulation to consolidate their actions and on February 5, 2021, the court consolidated the action under the caption In re Evolus, Inc.\nDerivative Litigation, No. 1:20-cv-09986-PPG, and adjourned defendants’ time to move, answer or otherwise respond to the complaints. On September 20,\n2021, the court so-ordered the parties’ stipulated stay of the consolidated derivative suit pending the court’s decision on the defendants’ motion to dismiss the\nSecurities Class Action.\nIt is possible that additional suits will be filed, or additional allegations will be made by stockholders, with respect to these same or similar or other matters and\nalso naming the Company and/or its officers and directors as defendants. The Company believes that the complaints are without merit and intends to vigorously\ndefend against it. However, the outcome of the legal proceeding is uncertain at this point. Based on information available to the Company at present,\nmanagement cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss with respect to this matter.\nBooks and Records Demand\n27\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nOn March 5, 2021, the Company received a letter from a putative stockholder demanding inspection of specified categories of the Company’s books and\nrecords under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporations Law. The Company was subsequently informed that the stockholder sold his shares of the\nCompany’s common stock. On October 13, 2021, the Company received a substantially similar demand to inspect specified categories of the Company’s books\nand records under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporations Law from another putative stockholder. The subject of the demand is substantially similar\nto the allegations in the putative securities class action and derivative complaints described above. The Company responded to the demand in December 2021.\nThe outcome of this matter is uncertain at this point. Based on information available to the Company at present, management cannot reasonably estimate a\nrange of loss with respect to this matter.\nOther Legal Matters\nThe Company is, from time to time, involved in various litigation matters or regulatory encounters arising in the ordinary course of business that could result in\nunasserted or asserted claims or litigation. These other matters may raise difficult and complex legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but\nnot limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit or regulatory encounter is brought, and\ndifferences in applicable laws and regulations. Except as set forth above, the Company does not believe that these other matters would have a material adverse\neffect on its accompanying financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the resolution of one or more of the other matters in any reporting\nperiod could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results for that period.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for\ngeneral indemnifications. The Company’s exposure under these agreements is unknown because they involve claims that may be made against the Company in\nthe future, but have not yet been made. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such\nexpenditures can be reasonably estimated. No amounts were accrued as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 9. Stockholders’ Equity\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has 10,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.00001 per share. As of September 30, 2024, no shares of its preferred\nstock were issued and outstanding.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has 100,000,000 authorized shares of common stock with a par value of $0.00001 per share. As of September 30, 2024, 63,251,148 shares of its\ncommon stock were issued and outstanding.\nIn March 2024, the Company completed a follow-on offering and issued 3,554,000 shares of its common stock, at a price to the public of $14.07 per share. The\nCompany received net proceeds of $46,794 from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In\naddition, the Company granted the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to 533,100 additional shares of common stock (“option\nshares”) at the purchase price. In April 2024, the underwriters elected to exercise their option to purchase 318,100 of the allotted option shares.

Under the ATM Sales Agreement, the Sales Agent is entitled to compensation, at a commission rate equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from sales\nof the Company’s common shares under the ATM Program. The Company has not sold any shares under the ATM Sales Agreement.\n2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nThe Company’s 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) provides for the grant of incentive options to employees of the Company, and for the grant of\nnon-statutory options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards and other forms of stock\ncompensation to the Company’s officers, directors, consultants and employees of the Company. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may\nbe issued under the Plan is 4,361,291 shares, plus an annual increase on each anniversary of November 21, 2017 equal to 4.0% of the total issued and\noutstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of such anniversary (or such lesser number of shares as may be determined by the Company’s Board\nof Directors). As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate of 1,336,000 shares of its common stock available for future issuance under the\nPlan.\n2023 Inducement Incentive Plan\nIn September 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Company’s 2023 Inducement Incentive Plan (the “Inducement Plan”) in accordance with\nNasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).

Such grants were made pursuant to a stand-alone nonstatutory stock option agreement and\na stand-alone RSU agreement, which were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Any shares underlying the inducement grants\nare not, upon forfeiture, cancellation or expiration, returned to a pool of shares reserved for future issuance.\nStock Options\nOptions to purchase the Company’s stock are granted at exercise prices based on the Company’s common stock price on the date of grant. The option grants\ngenerally vest over a one- to four-year period. The options have a contractual term of ten years. The fair value of options is estimated using the Black-Scholes\noption pricing model, which has various inputs, including the grant date common share price, exercise price, risk-free interest rate, volatility, expected life and\ndividend yield. The change of any of these inputs could significantly impact the determination of the fair value of the Company’s options as\n29\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nwell as significantly impact its results of operations.

The fair value of RSU grants is determined at the grant date based on the common share price.\nA summary of RSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is presented below:\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date\nRestricted Fair Value\nStock Units Per Share\nOutstanding, December 31, 2023 3,281,045 $ 8.88\nGranted 1,167,127 12.76\nVested (988,769) 8.79\nForfeited (257,570) 9.84\nOutstanding, September 30, 2024 3,201,833 $ 10.25\nPerformance Restricted Stock Units\n30\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nIn January 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors granted 292,349 shares of performance restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) to certain executive officers under\nthe Plan. The PRSU awards function in the same manner as restricted stock units except that vesting terms are based on achievement of certain pre-established\nperformance measures. As of September 30, 2024, all of the pre-established performance measures were met, and stock-based compensation expense has been\nrecognized for these awards using the accelerated attribution model, based on the fair value of the awards as of the date of grant.\nIn February 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors granted 219,485 shares of PRSUs to certain executive officers under the Plan. The PRSU awards are\nmeasured on a cumulative two-year period ending in 2025. The performance measure milestones have not been met, and all were outstanding as of September\n30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the achievement of the performance measure milestones was considered probable.\nA summary of PRSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is presented below:\nPerformance Weighted Average\nRestricted Grant Date\nStock Fair Value\nUnits Per Share\nOutstanding, December 31, 2023 233,880 $ 10.25\nGranted 219,485 13.15\nVested (97,451) 10.25\nForfeited — —\nOutstanding, September 30, 2024 355,914 $ 12.04\nCEO Performance Award\nFor RSUs granted to employees that vest based on market conditions, such as the trading price of the Company’s common stock exceeding certain price targets,\nthe Company uses a Monte Carlo Simulation in estimating the fair value at grant date and recognizes compensation cost over the requisite service period. On\nMay 8, 2023, the Company granted the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) an award of 560,000 PRSUs under the Plan.\nThe stock units subject to the award are subject to both performance- and time-based vesting requirements. 40% of the stock units subject to the award are\neligible to vest if the average of the closing prices for a share of the Company’s common stock over a period of 20 consecutive trading days is $30 or more and\nan additional 60% of the stock units subject to the award are eligible to vest if the average of the closing prices for a share of the Company’s common stock\nover a period of 20 consecutive trading days is $50 or more, in each case within five years after the grant of the award and while the CEO is employed by the\nCompany (or, in certain circumstances, within 20 days following a termination of his employment). Any stock units that become eligible to vest based on stock\nprice will vest, subject to the CEO’s continued service, over the four-year period after the grant date.\nThe Company used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine that the grant date fair value of the awards was $3,774. Compensation expense is recorded if the\nservice condition is met regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense:\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended\n30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSelling, general and administrative $ 4,955 $ 4,295 $ 15,370 $ 11,445\nResearch and development 265 301 713 616\n$ 5,220 $ 4,596 $ 16,083 $ 12,061\n31\nTable of Contents\nEvolus, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nNote 10.

(“Medytox”) in the U.S. International Trade Commission related to Jeuveau® (the “ITC Action”) and certain related matters by entering into\na Settlement and License Agreement with Medytox and Allergan (the “U.S. Settlement Agreement”), and another Settlement and License Agreement with\nMedytox (the “ROW Settlement Agreement”). The Company refers to the U.S. Settlement Agreement and the ROW Settlement Agreement collectively as the\n“Medytox Settlement Agreements”. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company made a final milestone payment of $5,000. From September 17, 2022 to\nSeptember 16, 2032, the Company pays Medytox a quarterly, mid-single digit royalty on net sales of Jeuveau® sold in other Evolus territories pursuant to the\nMedytox Settlement Agreements.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company accrued $3,658 for royalties to Medytox under the Medytox Settlement Agreements.

This discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to\nthose described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any\nforward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Part II of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a global performance beauty company with a customer-centric approach to delivering breakthrough products in the cash-pay aesthetic market. Our first\nproduct, Jeuveau® (prabotulinumtoxinA-xvfs), is currently sold in the United States, Canada, certain European countries and Australia. We have commercial\nlaunch plans in additional countries which we expect to implement in the next few years. We are also actively pursuing regulatory approval of Evolysse™, a\nline of injectable hyaluronic acid gels that includes mid face, nasolabial folds, lips and eyes. In October 2024, regulatory approval was received in the European\nUnion for four products in the Evolysse™ line: Evolysse™ Form, Evolysse™ Smooth, Evolysse™ Sculpt and Evolysse™ Lips. In June 2024, we submitted a\npremarket approval (“PMA”) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for Evolysse™ Form and Evolysse™ Smooth injectable\nhyaluronic acid gels for wrinkles and folds, such as nasolabial folds. We anticipate obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States for Evolysse™ Form\nand Evolysse™ Smooth by September 2025.\nJeuveau® is a proprietary 900 kDa purified botulinum toxin type A formulation indicated for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to\nsevere glabellar lines, also known as “frown lines,” in adults. Evolysse™, a line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels, is a first-generation cold technology line of\nhyaluronic acid gels for products including mid face, nasolabial folds, lips and eyes. Our primary market is the cash-pay aesthetic market, which consists of\nmedical products that consumers pay for directly out of pocket. Our customers are aesthetic practitioners who are properly licensed to deliver our products. By\navoiding the regulatory burdens that accompany reimbursed products and pursuing an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy, we create flexibility to\ndeliver a unique value proposition to our customers. We utilize this flexibility to drive customer adoption through programs such as our consumer loyalty\nprogram, co-branded marketing programs, promotional events and pricing strategies.\nRecent Developments\nEconomic Trends and Uncertainties\nThe global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced volatility and disruptions, including increases in inflation rates, rising\ninterest rates, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, and uncertainty about\neconomic stability. We expect elevated levels of cost inflation to continue, potentially impacting consumer discretionary spending for aesthetic medical\nprocedures. Markets experiencing uncertainty could have substantial high rates of inflation. We cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of increased\ninflation on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future.\n33\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nProduct revenue, net $ 60.2 $ 49.3\nService revenue 0.9 0.7\nTotal net revenues 61.1 50.0\nOperating expenses:\nProduct cost of sales (excludes amortization of intangible assets) 18.2 15.4\nSelling, general and administrative 52.5 43.3\nResearch and development 2.3 1.6\nRevaluation of contingent royalty obligation payable to Evolus Founders 2.4 1.8\nDepreciation and amortization 1.1 1.3\nTotal operating expenses 76.6 63.5\nLoss from operations (15.5) (13.4)\nOther income (expense):\nNon-operating expense, net (3.8) (3.5)\nOther income (expense), net 0.3 0.0\nLoss before income taxes: (19.0) (16.9)\nIncome tax expense 0.1 0.0\nNet loss (19.2) (16.9)\nUnrealized loss, net of tax (0.1) (0.1)\nComprehensive loss $ (19.3) $ (17.1)\nThe following table summarizes our gross profit margin for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nTotal net revenues $ 61.1 $ 50.0\nCost of sales:\nProduct cost of sales (excludes amortization of intangible assets) 18.2 15.4\nAmortization of distribution right intangible asset 0.8 0.7\nTotal cost of sales 19.0 16.2\nGross profit $ 42.1 $ 33.9\nGross profit margin 68.9 % 67.7 %\nNet Revenues\nWe currently operate in one reportable segment, and all of our net revenues are derived from sales of Jeuveau®, our sole commercial product to date. Net\nrevenues consist of revenues, net of adjustments primarily for customer rebates, rewards related to the consumer loyalty program and co-branded marketing\nprograms. Revenues are recognized when the control of\n34\nTable of Contents\nthe promised goods is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration allocated to the related performance obligations and to which we\nexpect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services.\nNet revenues of Jeuveau® sales increased by $11.1 million, or 22.2%, to $61.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $50.0 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Net revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nconsisted of $0.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively, of service revenue from the sale of Jeuveau® through a distribution partner in Canada. We anticipate\nour continued sales growth will depend on our ability to successfully continue to penetrate the market, grow our customer base and increase purchases by our\ncurrent customers in the competitive medical aesthetic market, as well as on obtaining regulatory approval for the Evolysse™ injectable hyaluronic acid gel\nline in the United States by Symatese and subsequent successful commercial launch of these products.\nCost of Sales\nProduct Cost of Sales\nProduct cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, primarily consisted of the cost of inventory purchased from Daewoong and our royalty\nobligations to Medytox at a mid-single digit percentage of net revenue through the expiration of our Medytox royalty obligation in September 2032.\nProduct cost of sales, excluding amortization of intangible assets, increased by $2.8 million, or 18.2%, to $18.2 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 from $15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume. We anticipate that our product cost of sales\nwill fluctuate in line with changes in revenues until the expiration of the Medytox royalty obligation in September 2032.\nGross Profit Margin\nOur gross profit margin was 68.9% and 67.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our gross profit margin has been and\nwill continue to be negatively impacted from September 2022 to September 2032 as we pay royalty obligations related to our litigation settlement agreement.\nSee “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Litigation Settlement” for further information. We also anticipate our gross profit margin will fluctuate as we\nimplement various marketing programs that may affect the average selling price for Jeuveau® and as we continue to expand internationally.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.2 million, or 21.2%, to $52.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $43.3\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from increasing personnel costs related to our commercial activities. Selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses may fluctuate in the future primarily due to potential changes in marketing strategies and international launches.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased by $0.7 million to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.6 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to our clinical operations and research and development expenses related to\nobtaining regulatory approvals of Evolysse™ in the United States and European countries. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to\nincrease if and when we develop further product candidates and as we pursue regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions for our current products.\nRevaluation of Contingent Royalty Obligation Payable to Evolus Founders\nThe change in the fair value of the contingent royalty obligation payable to Evolus Founders is recorded in operating expenses in each reporting period. During\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the revaluation charges of $2.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively, were primarily driven by changes\nin management assumptions relating to revenue forecasts, the discount rate used and the timing of cash flows.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by $0.2 million, or 15.4%, to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.3 million for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023.\n35\nTable of Contents\nNon-Operating Expense, Net\nNon-operating expense, net, increased by $0.3 million, or 8.6%, to $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $3.5 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense for our term loans. Interest on our term loans is based on a variable interest rate,\nwhich we expect will continue to fluctuate with the market.

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for the foreseeable future as we increase marketing efforts for Jeuveau® in the U.S.,\nEurope, Canada, and Australia and prepare to commercially launch Jeuveau® in other jurisdictions where we have obtained regulatory approval pursue\nregulatory approvals in other jurisdictions and prepare to commercially launch Evolysse™ Form, Smooth, and Sculpt injectable hyaluronic acid gel line.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe markets in which we operate are currently experiencing increased inflation. While we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our\nbusiness, revenues or operating results during the periods presented, a prolonged inflationary environment could impact consumer discretionary spending for\naesthetic medical procedures, increase our cash required for operations and impact our liquidity position.\nFollow-On Offering\nIn March 2024, we completed a follow-on offering and issued 3,554,000 shares of its common stock, at a price to the public of $14.07 per share. We received\nnet proceeds of $46.8 million from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In addition, we granted\nthe underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to 533,100 additional shares of common stock (the “option shares”) at the purchase price,\nwhich the underwriters\n38\nTable of Contents\nexercised in April 2024 with respect to 318,100 of the allotted option shares. The net proceeds to us from the sale of the option shares, after deducting the\nunderwriters’ discounts and commissions, was $4.2 million.\n“At-the-market” Offerings of Common Stock\nOn March 8, 2023, we entered into an “at-the-market” sales agreement (the “ATM Sales Agreement”) and filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and\ncorresponding prospectus with the SEC to permit sales under the ATM Sales Agreement, which registration statement became effective on June 8, 2023. We\nhave not sold any shares under the ATM Sales Agreement. See Note 9. Stockholders’ Equity in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part I, Item of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nThe Pharmakon Term Loans\nOn December 14, 2021, we entered into a loan agreement with BPCR Limited Partnership, BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, and Biopharma\nCredit PLC (collectively, “Pharmakon”). The loan agreement, as amended, provided for Pharmakon to make multiple term loans to us totaling $125.0 million\n(“Pharmakon Term Loans”). The first tranche of $75.0 million was advanced on December 29, 2021. A second tranche of $25.0 million was advanced on May\n31, 2023. The final tranche of $25.0 million was advanced on December 15, 2023. We are required to pay interest only under the loan agreement until March\n2026, after which we make seven equal quarterly payments, each in an amount equal to 1/12th of the outstanding principal amount of the loan. We pay the\nremaining principal of the loan on the maturity date. The Pharmakon Term Loans will mature on the sixth-year anniversary of the closing date of the first\ntranche. The term loan bears an annual interest rate equal to the 3-month secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) (subject to a SOFR rate floor of 1.0%) plus\n8.5% per annum. The proceeds of the Pharmakon Term Loans are used to fund our general corporate and working capital requirements.\nContingent Royalties to Evolus Founders\nWe are obligated to make quarterly royalty payments of a low-single digit percentage of net sales of Jeuveau® to the founders of Evolus (“Evolus Founders”).\nThese obligations terminate at the end of the second quarter of 2029. The fair value of the obligations is valued quarterly and is referred to in our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements as the contingent royalty obligation.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we recorded an aggregate balance of $45.0 million on our balance sheet for the future royalty payment obligation to Evolus\nFounders.\nLitigation Settlement\nIn February 2021, we settled litigation claims related to a complaint against us filed by Allergan, Inc. and Allergan Limited (together, “Allergan”) and\nMedytox, Inc. (“Medytox”) in the U.S. International Trade Commission related to Jeuveau® (the “ITC Action”) and certain related matters by entering into a\nSettlement and License Agreement with Medytox and Allergan, which we refer to as the U.S. Settlement Agreement, and another Settlement and License\nAgreement with Medytox which we refer to as the Medytox Settlement Agreement. We refer to the U.S. Settlement Agreement and the ROW Settlement\nAgreement collectively as the Medytox. In the first quarter of 2023, we made a final milestone payment of $5.0 million. Going forward, from September 17,\n2022 to September 16, 2032, we will pay to Medytox a quarterly, mid-single digit royalty on net sales of Jeuveau® sold in other Evolus territories pursuant to\nthe Medytox Settlement Agreement.\nDaewoong Agreement\nOur agreement (as amended, the “Daewoong Agreement”) with Daewoong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (“Daewoong”), provides us with an exclusive distribution\nlicense to Jeuveau® from Daewoong for aesthetic indications in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, members of the European Economic\nArea, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as co-exclusive distribution rights with Daewoong in Japan. The Daewoong\nAgreement includes certain minimum annual purchases we are required to make in order to maintain the exclusivity of the license. We may, however, meet\nthese minimum purchase obligations by achieving certain market share in our licensed territories. These potential minimum purchase obligations are contingent\nupon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and our future market share in various jurisdictions.\nSymatese Agreements\n39\nTable of Contents\nIn 2023, we entered into two agreements with Symatese S.A.S. and its affiliates (“Symatese”), which granted us exclusive rights to commercialize and\ndistribute the Evolysse™ line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels in the United States and 50 countries in Europe for aesthetic and dermatological uses. We refer\nto the agreement conveying rights in the United States as the “Symatese U.S. Agreement” and the agreement conveying rights in Europe as the “Symatese\nEurope Agreement.” In the United States, we obtained the rights to the Evolysse™ products referred to as (i) Form; (ii) Smooth; (iii) Sculpt; (iv) Lips; and (v)\nEye and in Europe we obtained the rights to (i) Form; (ii) Smooth; (iii) Sculpt; and (iv) Lips.\nSymatese U.S. Agreement\nThe Symatese U.S. Agreement includes certain milestone payments, development cost-sharing arrangements, and minimum annual purchases we are required\nto make in order to maintain the exclusivity of the license. We may, however, meet these minimum purchase obligations by achieving certain market share in\nour licensed territory. These potential minimum purchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental\napprovals and our future market share.\nSymatese Europe Agreement\nThe Symatese Europe Agreement includes certain milestone payments and minimum annual purchases we are required to make in order to maintain the\nexclusivity of the license. We may, however, meet these minimum purchase obligations by achieving certain market share in our licensed territory. These\npotential minimum purchase obligations are contingent upon the occurrence of future events, including receipt of governmental approvals and our future\nmarket share.\nOperating Leases\nOur corporate headquarters in Newport Beach, California is under a non-cancelable operating lease, which expires on January 31, 2030 with an option to\nextend the term for an additional 60 months. Lease payments increase based on an annual rent escalation clause that occurs on each February 1 anniversary.\nCurrent and Future Capital Requirements\nWe believe that our current capital resources, which consist of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations, and existing liquidity, will be\nsufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months for working capital to support our daily operations and meet commitments under\nour contractual obligations with third parties, although we may wish to access the debt and equity markets or other sources of financing to satisfy our long-term\ncash requirements as further discussed below.\nWe have based our projections of capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all our available capital resources, which\nconsist of cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, sooner than we expect. Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including\nbut not limited to, the impact of any potential disruptions to our supply chain, inflation or other economic conditions, uncertainty regarding the stability of\ncertain financial institutions, and other long-term commitments and contingencies. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research,\ndevelopment and commercialization of our products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements, including our\nrequirements beyond the next twelve months. In such case, we may be required to raise additional capital to fund future operations through the incurrence of\ndebt, the entry into licensing or collaboration agreements with partners, sale of equity securities, grants or other sources of financing. However, there can be no\nassurance such financing or other alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. The global economy, including the financial and credit\nmarkets, has recently experienced significant volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability and rising interest rates.\nThese conditions may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n• the rate of revenue growth for Jeuveau® in the United States and international markets where we have launched, as well as the success of planned\ninternational launches;\n• the timing of regulatory approval for the Evolysse™ injectable hyaluronic acid gel line in the United States by Symatese and our ability to\nsuccessfully launch, commercialize and market these products;\n• development costs and milestone payments related to the Evolysse™ injectable hyaluronic acid gels;\n40\nTable of Contents\n• our ability to forecast demand for our products, scale our supply to meet that demand and manage working capital effectively;\n• corporate development activities including the purchase, license, or other acquisition of products and services to add to our product or service\nofferings;\n• the number, characteristics, and development stage of any future product candidates we may develop or acquire;\n• the timing and costs of any ongoing clinical programs or any future clinical studies we may conduct;\n• the cost of manufacturing our product or any future product candidates and any products we successfully commercialize, including costs associated\nwith our supply chain;\n• the timing and amounts of the royalty and other payments payable in connection with the Medytox Settlement Agreement;\n• the amounts of the royalty payable to the Evolus Founders;\n• the cost of commercialization activities for Jeuveau®, the Evolysse™ injectable hyaluronic acid gel line or any future product candidates that are\napproved or cleared for commercialization, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;\n• the cost of maintaining a sales force, the productivity of that sales force, the market acceptance of our products and the actions and product\nintroductions of our competitors;\n• our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements that we\nmay enter into;\n• any product liability or other lawsuits related to our products;\n• the cost of any current litigation, including our ongoing securities class action lawsuit and shareholder derivative lawsuit;\n• the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n• the costs associated with being a public company;\n• the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property and any other future intellectual\nlitigation we may be involved in; and\n• the timing, receipt and amount of sales of any future approved or cleared products, if any.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (22.8) $ (34.8)\nInvesting activities (3.5) (1.3)\nFinancing activities 48.7 21.1\nEffect of exchange rates on cash (0.3) (0.3)\nChange in cash and cash equivalents 22.2 (15.2)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 62.8 53.9\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 85.0 $ 38.7\n41\nTable of Contents\nOperating Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating activities used $22.8 million of cash, which primarily resulted from our net loss of $43.6 million.\nNet operating assets and liabilities changed by $7.8 million, primarily driven by improved collections from customers, payments to vendors and the timing\nof inventory purchases from our supplier. Operating activities also includes adjustments for certain non-cash charges including $16.1 million of stock-based\ncompensation expense, $5.6 million in revaluation of our contingent royalty obligation, $1.7 million of provision of allowance for doubtful accounts and\n$3.9 million of depreciation and amortization.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, operating activities used $34.8 million of cash, which primarily resulted from our net loss of $49.9 million. Net\noperating assets and liabilities improved by $8.7 million, primarily driven by improved collections from customers, payments to vendors, the timing of\ninventory purchases from our supplier, and the final cash litigation settlement payment of $5.0 million to Medytox and Allergan. Operating activities also\nincludes adjustments for certain non-cash charges including $12.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, $5.1 million in revaluation of our contingent\nroyalty obligation, $1.4 million of provision of allowance for doubtful accounts and $3.8 million of depreciation and amortization.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $1.3 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $48.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $21.1 million of cash provided by\nfinancing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by\nfinancing activities resulted from $25.0 million net proceeds from drawing on the second tranche of the Pharmakon Term Loans as described above.\nIndebtedness\n“See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—The Pharmakon Term Loans” for a description of our Pharmakon Term Loans.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, including commitments for capital expenditures, primarily consist of (i)\nprincipal and interest payments related to our Pharmakon Term Loans (future interest payments on our outstanding Pharmakon Term Loans total approximately\n$47.3 million, with $17.7 million due within twelve months), (ii) quarterly royalty payments to the Evolus Founders of a low-single digit percentage of net\nsales of Jeuveau® (these obligations terminate in the quarter after the 10-year anniversary of the first commercial sale of Jeuveau® in the United States), (iii)\nquarterly royalty payments to Medytox of a low-double digit royalty on net sales of Jeuveau® sold in the United States and other Evolus territories (during the\nperiod from September 17, 2022 to September 16, 2032), (iv) minimum purchase obligations under the Daewoong Agreement, (v) €12.1 milestone payments\nunder the Symatese U.S. Agreement consisting of €1.6 million in June 2025, €4.1 million in June 2026, €3.2 million in June 2027, and €3.2 million in June\n2028, in each case subject to three of the injectable hyaluronic acid gels gaining approval prior to that date, (vi) €3.1 million of milestone payments under the\nSymatese Europe Agreement consisting of : €1.2 million on the second anniversary of certain regulatory approvals and €1.9 million on the earlier of the third\nanniversary of certain regulatory approvals or following a year in which we achieves €25 million in revenue in Europe for the injectable hyaluronic acid\nproducts, and (vii) obligations under operating leases related to our office space which are described in more detail in Note 7. Operating Leases in the Notes to\nthe Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nthere were no material changes to these obligations as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have\nbeen prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses at the date of the\nconsolidated financial\n42\nTable of Contents\nstatements as well as the expenses incurred during the reporting period. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates\nunder different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material to the financial position and results of operations. On an ongoing basis, we\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nWe describe the recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements that apply to us in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recent\nAccounting Pronouncements in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to\nadverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency\nexchange rates.\nFor financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, reference is made to the “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” section in the Annual Report on Form\n10-K and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included therein. As of the date of this report, there were no material changes in our financial\nmarket risks from the risks disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n43\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, who serve as our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls\nand procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (b) that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September\n30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nAny controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and\nmanagement necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the\nevaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred with respect to the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n44\nTable of Contents\nPart II—Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nSee “Legal Proceedings” in Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies for information regarding legal proceedings.\n45\nTable of Contents\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties discussed below update, supersede and replace the risks and uncertainties previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on March 7, 2024, and previously disclosed in Part II, Item 1A of\nour Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on July 31, 2024. We do not believe any of the changes\nconstitute material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in such prior Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAn investment in our company involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all the\nother information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Part I, Item 2“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be seriously harmed. The risks and uncertainties described\nbelow are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become\nimportant factors that adversely affect our business. Unless otherwise indicated, references to our business being seriously harmed in these risk factors will\ninclude harm to our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue and future prospects. In that event, the market price of our common\nstock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe currently depend entirely on the successful marketing of our only commercially available product, Jeuveau®. If we are unable to successfully continue\nto market and sell Jeuveau®, we may not generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nWe currently have only one commercially available product, Jeuveau®, and our business presently depends entirely on our ability to successfully continue to\nmarket and sell it in a timely manner. We commercially launched in the United States in May 2019 and through a distribution partner in Canada in October\n2019. We commercially launched Jeuveau® in select European countries in September 2022 and in Australia in July 2024, and as such, we have a limited\nhistory of generating revenue in those markets. Our near-term prospects, including our ability to generate revenue, as well as our future growth, depend entirely\non the continued successful commercialization of Jeuveau®. The commercial success of Jeuveau® will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to\ncontinue to successfully market and sell Jeuveau®, whether alone or in collaboration with others, including our ability to hire, retain and train sales\nrepresentatives in the United States. Our ability to market and sell Jeuveau® is also dependent on the willingness of consumers to pay for Jeuveau® relative to\nother discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times. Additional factors necessary for the successful commercialization of Jeuveau®\ninclude the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety of Jeuveau® and relative efficacy of competing products, the timing of new product\nintroductions by our competitors, and the sales and marketing tactics of our competitors, including bundling of multiple products, in response to our launch of\nJeuveau®. Each of these factors may vary on a country by country basis as we expand our operations.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant issues\ncontinuing to market and sell Jeuveau®, and we may experience significant issues successfully marketing and selling any future product candidates. In addition,\nour experience as a commercial company is limited. Accordingly, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of Jeuveau® or any future\nproduct candidates to continue our business.\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we may incur losses in the future. We have\nonly one approved product and limited commercial sales, which, together with our limited operating history, makes it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a global performance beauty company with a limited operating history. To date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources\nin the clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercial launch of Jeuveau®, which is currently our only commercially available product. We began\nselling Jeuveau® in the United States in May 2019 and through a distribution partner in Canada in October 2019. We began selling Jeuveau® in select countries\nin Europe in September 2022 and in Australia in July 2024 and, as such, have a limited history of generating revenue in those markets. Consequently, any\npredictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or greater experience\ncommercializing a product. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and\nuncertainties frequently encountered\n46\nTable of Contents\nby companies in the medical aesthetics field. We have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 2012 and we expect to continue to incur significant\nexpenses for the foreseeable future as we increase marketing efforts for Jeuveau® in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Australia, prepare to commercially launch\nJeuveau® in other jurisdictions where we have obtained regulatory approval pursue regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions and prepare to commercially\nlaunch Evolysse™ injectable hyaluronic acid product line. We recorded net losses of $43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we\nrecorded a net loss of $61.7 million and net loss of $74.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit\nas of September 30, 2024 of $602.6 million. Our ability to achieve revenue and profitability is dependent on our ability to continue to successfully market and\nsell Jeuveau® obtain regulatory approvals for the Evolysse™ product line in the United States and Europe and commercialize these products. Even if we\nachieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses,\nmay adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, if needed, our ability to raise capital to continue operations.\nWe are reliant on Symatese to achieve regulatory approval for the Evolysse™ product line in the United States. Failure to obtain approval or obtain\napproval on our estimated time frame for the Evolysse™ product line would negatively affect our ability to sell these products.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and European regulatory processes for medical devices such as Evolysse™ are complex, time-consuming\nand subject to numerous inherent risks. Before Evolysse™ can be marketed in the United States or Europe, Symatese must obtain regulatory approval for the\ninjectable hyaluronic acid gels. We received approval for four Evolysse™ products in the European Union in October 2024. Regulators must determine that a\nproposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial,\nmanufacturing and labeling data. In addition, modifications to products that are approved by regulatory agencies generally require approval.\nWe are substantially dependent on our relationship with Symatese for the regulatory approval process of the Evolysse™ injectable hyaluronic acid product\ncandidates in the United States. While we have agreed to share certain costs associated with the regulatory approval process to provide our experience to\nSymatese, Symatese is ultimately responsible for obtaining regulatory approval of the Evolysse™ product line. If Symatese encounters difficulties or delays in\nobtaining regulatory approvals for these products, our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from these products could be materially and adversely\naffected. As a result, our reliance on Symatese for the regulatory approval process exposes us to risks associated with Symatese’s ability to successfully\nnavigate the complex regulatory landscape. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, if Symatese fails to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements or if regulatory authorities impose new requirements, the\napproval process could be delayed or approvals could be denied. This may result in additional costs, reduced revenue projections, and potential harm to our\nbusiness, reputation and market position.\nWe may require additional financing to fund our future operations or execute corporate development activities, which could dilute the ownership interest of\nour existing stockholders, and a failure to obtain additional capital when so needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or\nterminate our operations.\nWe have utilized substantial amounts of cash since our inception in order to conduct clinical development to support regulatory approval and launch of\nJeuveau® in the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. We expect that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in\norder to continue to market and sell Jeuveau® and for the clinical and regulatory development and eventual commercialization of Evolysse™ and any\nadditional product candidates we may choose to pursue. While we believe that we currently have adequate capital resources, which consist of cash and cash\nequivalents, cash generated from operations and availability under our ATM Program, to operate our business until our business generates profits and positive\ncash flow, this belief is based upon certain financial assumptions including net revenue, gross margin, working capital and expense assumptions. If these\nassumptions are incorrect, or if we experience other risks or uncertainties set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we may require additional capital to\noperate our business.\nWe expect to expend resources furthering the development and continuation of our marketing programs and commercialization infrastructure in connection\nwith commercializing Jeuveau® within and outside of the United States. We have also agreed to reimburse Symatese for certain clinical trial expenses related to\nthe Evolysse™ Lip and Eye products in the United States and for certain regulatory filing fees in Europe. In the long term, our expenditures will include costs\nassociated with the continued commercialization of Jeuveau®, research and development, approval and commercialization of\n47\nTable of Contents\nproducts and any of our future product candidates, including our proposed higher strength dose of Jeuveau® and the Evolysse™ line of injectable hyaluronic\nacid gels, such as research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing and supplying as well as marketing and selling\nany products approved for sale. Because the commercialization expenditures needed to meet our sales objectives are highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably\nestimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully market and sell Jeuveau® or, if approved, the Evolysse™ line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels. We may\nin the future, also, acquire other companies or products which may be costly and which may require additional capital to operate. In addition, other\nunanticipated costs may arise. Accordingly, our actual cash needs may exceed our expectations.\nIf we were to raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements, or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements\nwith third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or\ngrant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings or offerings of securities\nconvertible into our equity, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted and the terms of any such securities may have a preference over\nour common stock. Debt financing, receivables financing and royalty financing may also be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase\nour capital stock, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders’ ownership, and such dilution may be material. Additionally, if we raise\nadditional capital through debt financing, we will have increased fixed or variable payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting\nour ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures to meet specified financial ratios, and other operational\nrestrictions, any of which could restrict our ability to market and sell Jeuveau® or any future product candidates or operate as a business and may result in liens\nbeing placed on our assets. If we were to default on any of our indebtedness, we could lose such assets.\nIn addition, the global economy, including the financial and credit markets, has recently experienced significant volatility and disruptions, including severely\ndiminished liquidity and credit availability and rising interest rates. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient capital to fund our commercialization efforts to\nachieve specified minimum sales targets under the Daewoong Agreement, Symatese U.S. Agreement and the Symatese Europe Agreement, we will lose\nexclusivity of the license that we have been granted under those respective agreements. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or\non acceptable terms, we will be required to take actions to address our liquidity needs which may include the following: significantly reduce operating\nexpenses and delay, reduce the scope of or discontinue some of our development programs, commercialization efforts or other aspects of our business plan,\nout-license intellectual property rights to our product candidates and sell unsecured assets, or a combination of the above. As a result, our ability to achieve\nprofitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and/or our ability to fund our scheduled obligations on a timely basis or at all.\nIf we or our counterparties do not comply with the terms of our settlement agreement with Medytox, we may face litigation or lose our ability to market and\nsell Jeuveau®, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to carry out our business and our financial condition and ability to continue as a\ngoing concern.\nEffective February 18, 2021, we entered into a Settlement and License Agreement with Medytox, which we refer to as the Medytox Settlement Agreement.\nUnder the Medytox Settlement Agreement we obtained (i) a license to commercialize, manufacture and to have manufactured for us certain products identified\nin the Medytox Settlement Agreements, including Jeuveau® (the “Licensed Products”), in the United States and other territories where we license Jeuveau®, (ii)\nthe dismissal of outstanding litigation against us, including the action filed by Allergan and Medytox in the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC\nAction”), a rescission of the related remedial orders, and the dismissal of a civil case in the Superior Court of California against us, which we refer to together\nwith any claims (including claims brought in Korean courts) with a common nexus of fact as the Medytox Actions, and (iii) releases of claims against us for the\nMedytox Actions. Under the agreement, we remain obligated to pay to Medytox a mid-single digit royalty percentage on net sales of Jeuveau® in the United\nStates and all territories we have licensed outside the United States until September 16, 2032. In addition, under the Medytox Settlement Agreement we made\ncertain representations and warranties and agreed to certain customary positive and negative covenants.\nIn the event we fail to comply with the terms of the Medytox Settlement Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods, Medytox would have the ability to\nterminate the Medytox Settlement Agreement and thereby cancel the licenses granted to us and re-institute litigation against us. Any litigation may result in\nremedies against our products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties\nand/or other forms of\n48\nTable of Contents\ncompensation to third parties, any of which would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from Jeuveau®, to carry out our business, and\nto continue as a going concern.\nAdditionally, if Medytox fails to comply with the terms of the Medytox Settlement Agreement and comply with the covenants and agreements under the\nMedytox Settlement Agreement, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from Jeuveau®, to carry out our business, and to\ncontinue as a going concern. For example, as required by the Medytox Settlement Agreement, in February 2021 Medytox filed a document with the Korean\ncourt that its litigation with Daewoong would not affect our right to have Jeuveau® manufactured by Daewoong or exported to us. If Medytox were to breach\nthe Medytox Settlement Agreement and rescind this filing and the Korean court issued a ruling against Daewoong, our supply of Jeuveau® could be hindered.\nWe would also be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation in order to enforce our rights under the Medytox Settlement Agreement.\nThe terms of the Medytox Settlement Agreement will reduce our profitability until the royalty obligations expire, and may affect the extent of any discounts\nwe may offer to our customers.\nAs a result of the royalty payments that we are required to pay under the Medytox Settlement Agreement, our profitability has and will be adversely impacted\nfor the period that we are required to pay royalties. We may be able to offset a portion of the loss of profitability by decreasing any discount to customers on\nJeuveau® as compared to discounts we provided to customers prior to the Medytox Settlement Agreement. If we reduce discounts for any customers, their\nvolume of purchases may decrease which would have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with a public health crisis or contagious disease outbreak.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health crises or contagious disease outbreaks. For example, we experienced material adverse effects on our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from the COVID-19 pandemic. Another public health crises, including any significant\nresurgence of COVID-19 or other future contagious disease outbreaks, could have a similar material adverse effect on our business. Financial and operational\nimpacts that we experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, and may experience as a result of future contagious disease outbreaks or other public\nhealth crises, include:\n• a decline in the rates of elective procedures;\n• difficulties in enrolling patients in clinical programs;\n• changes in the availability of our key personnel;\n• temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our business partners, customers, third-party service providers or other vendors;\n• interruptions to our supply chain and distribution channels; and\n• downstream economic effects, including disruptions capital or financial markets, increased inflation and rising interest rates.\nDepending on the severity of the financial and operational impacts, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely\nimpacted. The extent to which any future public health crises may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition depends on many factors\nwhich are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of any outbreak, its severity, the\nactions to contain or address the impact of the outbreak, the timing, distribution, and efficacy of vaccines and other treatments, United States and foreign\ngovernment actions to respond to possible reductions in global economic activity, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating\nconditions can resume.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause we do not expect Jeuveau® for the treatment of glabellar lines or, subject to regulatory approval, the Evolysse™ line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels\nto be reimbursed by any government or third-party payor, our products will continue to be paid for directly by the consumer. Demand for Jeuveau® and, subject\nto regulatory approval, the Evolysse™ line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels, is accordingly tied to the discretionary spending levels of our targeted consumer\npopulation. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, instability or crises affecting banks or other financial institutions, or inflation in consumer prices, as we\nare currently experiencing, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including a decline in the\n49\nTable of Contents\ndiscretionary spending of our target consumer population, which could lead to a weakened demand for Jeuveau®, Evolysse™, or any future product candidates.\nA severe or prolonged economic downturn may also affect our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining\neconomy, instability or crises affecting banks or other financial institutions, or political disruption or geopolitical conflicts, including the military conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our\ncustomers to delay making payments for our products. Inflation in the markets we serve could similarly impact our revenues, as consumer spending power\ncould decline. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\nIn addition, our business strategy was developed based on a number of important assumptions about the cash-pay healthcare market. For example, we believe\nthat the number of cash-pay healthcare procedures will increase in the future. However, these trends are uncertain and limited sources exist to obtain reliable\nmarket data. Therefore, sales of Jeuveau® or any of our future product candidates could differ materially from our projections if our assumptions are incorrect.\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial\ninstitutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe funds in our operating accounts are held in banks or other financial institutions. Our cash held in non-interest bearing and interest-bearing accounts\nexceeds applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. Bank failures, events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-\nperformance or other adverse developments occur with respect to the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds, or that affect financial institutions\nor the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks may lead to widespread demands for\ncustomer withdrawals and liquidity constraints that may result in market-wide liquidity problems, which could adversely impact our liquidity. For example, on\nMarch 10, 2023, the FDIC announced that Silicon Valley Bank had been closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. On\nMarch 26, 2023, the assets, deposits and loans of Silicon Valley Bank were acquired by First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company. Although we did not have any\nfunds in Silicon Valley Bank or other institutions that have been closed, we cannot guarantee that the banks or other financial institutions that hold our funds\nwill not experience similar issues.\nIn addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher\ninterest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more\ndifficult for us to acquire financing on terms favorable to us, or at all, and could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity, our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations, and our prospects. Our business may be adversely impacted by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this\ntime, there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences.\nOur products face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration and\nexpansion.\nJeuveau® is approved for use and Evolysse™ is being investigated for use in medical aesthetic market. Regulatory approval has been received for the\nEvolysse™ in the European Union in October 2024. The United States regulatory approval and commercial launch is expected by September 2025 for the first\ntwo products with subsequent regulatory approval and product launches for the remaining products in 2026 and 2027. The medical aesthetic market is highly\ncompetitive and dynamic and is characterized by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovations. Our products face, and we\nanticipate that our future products will face, significant competition from other facial aesthetic products, such as other injectable and topical botulinum toxins\nand injectable hyaluronic acid gels. Our products may also compete with unapproved and off-label treatments. Many of our potential competitors, including\nAbbVie Inc., which acquired Allergan, who first launched BOTOX for cosmetic uses in 2002 and has since maintained the highest market share position in the\naesthetic neurotoxin market with its BOTOX product, are large, experienced companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, such as substantially\ngreater financial resources enabling them to, among other things, market and discount aggressively. Within the injectable hyaluronic acid market we will also\nface large, experienced competitors such as AbbVie and Galderma. Competitors may also have greater brand recognition for their products, larger sales forces\nand larger aesthetic product portfolios allowing the companies to bundle products to provide customers more choices and to further discount their products.\nAdditionally, our competitors have greater existing market share in the medical aesthetic market and long-standing customer loyalty programs and sales\ncontracts with large customers which creates established business and financial relationships with customers, aesthetic societies and universities.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThese competitors may also try to compete with our aesthetic products on price both directly, through rebates and promotional programs to high volume\ncustomers and coupons to consumers, and indirectly, through attractive product bundling with complimentary products, such as injectable hyaluronic acid gels\nthat offer convenience and an effectively lower price compared to the total price of purchasing each product separately. These companies may also seek to\ncompete based on their longer operating history. Larger companies may be better capitalized than us and, accordingly, are able to offer greater customer loyalty\nbenefits to encourage repeat use of their products and finance a sustained global advertising campaign to compete with our commercialization efforts at launch.\nA number of our larger competitors also have access to a significant number of studies and publications that they could use to compete with us.\nIn the long term, we expect to expand our focus to the broader cash-pay healthcare market. Competitors and other parties may seek to impact regulatory\napproval of our future product applications through the filing of citizen petitions or other similar documents, which could require costly and time-consuming\nresponses to the regulatory agencies. Larger competitors could seek to prevent or delay our commercialization efforts via costly litigation which can be lengthy\nand expensive and serve to distract our management team’s attention. We could face competition from other sources as well, including academic institutions,\ngovernmental agencies and public and private research institutions. In addition, we are aware of other companies also developing and/or marketing products in\none or more of our target markets, including competing injectable botulinum toxin type A formulations that are currently in Phase III clinical development in\nNorth America for the treatment of glabellar lines. For example, Revance Therapeutics, Inc. obtained approval for an injectable botulinum toxin type A\nneurotoxin on September 8, 2022, called “Daxxify” and Hugel, Inc. obtained approval for its injectable botulinum toxin type A neurotoxin on February 29,\n2024. Additionally, both Galderma S.A. and Medytox, Inc. have submitted a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the FDA for an injectable botulinum\ntoxin type A neurotoxin. With the approval of Revance Therapeutic’s and Hugel’s BLAs and the potential approval of additional BLAs, we expect the\ncompetition in the U.S. injectable botulinum toxin market to further increase. We would face similar risks with respect to any future product candidates that we\nmay seek to develop or commercialize in the broader cash-pay healthcare market. Successful competitors in that market have the ability to effectively discover,\nobtain patents, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved\nproducts, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical staff.\nOur strategy of competing in the aesthetic neurotoxin market is dependent on the marketing and pricing flexibility that we believe is afforded to a company\nwith a portfolio limited to cash-pay healthcare, comprised of products and procedures that are not reimbursed by third-party payors. In the event that\nregulations applicable to reimbursed products are changed to apply to cash-pay healthcare products, we would no longer have this flexibility and we may not\nbe able to compete as effectively with our competitors which may have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, as a result of the royalty payments that we are required to pay under the Medytox Settlement Agreement, we may not be able to discount\nJeuveau® to the extent that we previously provided discounts to customers without impacting our gross profit margins. If we increase prices for any customers,\ntheir volume of purchases may decrease which would have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, competitors may develop new technologies within the medical aesthetic market that may be superior in safety and efficacy to our products or offer\nalternatives to the use of toxins or injectable hyaluronic acid gels, including surgical and radio frequency techniques. To compete successfully in the medical\naesthetic market, we will have to demonstrate that our products are at least as safe and effective as current products sold by our competitors. Competition in the\nmedical aesthetic market could result in price-cutting and reduced profit margins, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nDue to less stringent regulatory requirements, there are many more aesthetic products and procedures available for use in international markets than are\napproved for use in the United States. There are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors in international markets can make about the\neffectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them. As a result, we expect to face more competition in these markets than in the\nUnited States.\nOur commercial opportunity could also be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, are more effective, have\nfewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than Jeuveau® or any other product that we may develop. Our competitors also may\nobtain FDA or other regulatory approval for these products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors\nestablishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market, which may create additional barriers to successfully commercializing Jeuveau®\nand any future product candidates and attracting practitioners and consumer demand.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOur products may fail to continue to achieve the broad degree of aesthetic practitioner adoption and use or consumer demand necessary for continued\ncommercial success.\nJeuveau® or, subject to regulatory approval, the Evolysse™ line of injectable hyaluronic acid gels may fail to continue to gain or gain sufficient market\nacceptance by aesthetic practitioners, consumers and others in the medical aesthetics community to continue to grow our net revenues. The continued\ncommercial success of Jeuveau® and any future product candidates, including a proposed higher strength dose of Jeuveau® and the Evolysse™ line of\ninjectable hyaluronic acid gels, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by aesthetic practitioners for approved\nindications, including, in the case of Jeuveau®, the treatment of glabellar lines and other aesthetic indications that we may seek to pursue. We are aware that\nother companies are seeking to develop alternative products and treatments, any of which could impact the demand for our products.\nThe degree and rate of practitioner adoption of Jeuveau® and any product candidates depend on a number of factors, including the cost, profitability to our\ncustomers, consumer demand, characteristics and effectiveness of the product. Our success will also depend on our ability to create compelling marketing\nprograms, training of our customers and ability to overcome any biases aesthetic practitioners or consumers may have toward the use, safety and efficacy of\nexisting products over our products. Moreover, our competitors may utilize negative selling efforts or offer more compelling marketing or discounting\nprograms than we are able to offer, including by bundling multiple aesthetic products to provide a more comprehensive offering than we can so long as\nJeuveau® remains our only commercially available product.\nIn addition, in its clinical trials, Jeuveau® was clinically tested and compared to BOTOX, both of which contain a 900 kDa complex. We believe that aesthetic\npractitioners’ familiarity with the 900 kDa complex’s handling, preparation and dosing will more easily facilitate incorporation of Jeuveau® into their practices.\nHowever, the ease of integration of Jeuveau® into an aesthetic practitioner’s practice may not be as seamless as we anticipate.\nWith respect to consumer demand, the treatment of glabellar lines with Jeuveau® is an elective procedure, the cost of which must be borne by the consumer,\nand we do not expect costs related to the treatment to be reimbursable through any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance. The\ndecision by a consumer to undergo treatment with Jeuveau® for the treatment of glabellar lines or other aesthetic indications that we may pursue may be\ninfluenced by a number of factors, including the cost, efficacy, safety, perception, marketing programs for, and aesthetic practitioner recommendations of\nJeuveau® versus competitive products or procedures. Moreover, consumer demand may fluctuate over time as a result of consumer sentiment about the benefits\nand risks of aesthetic procedures generally and Jeuveau® in particular, changes in demographics and social trends, rising inflation and general consumer\nconfidence and consumer discretionary spending, which may be impacted by a public health crisis or contagious disease outbreak as well as economic and\npolitical conditions.\nIf Jeuveau®, Evolysse™, or any product candidates fails to achieve the broad degree of aesthetic practitioner adoption necessary for commercial success or the\nrequisite consumer demand, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate\nrevenue and continue our business.\nOur ability to market Jeuveau® is limited to use for the treatment of glabellar lines, and if we want to expand the indications for which we market\nJeuveau®, we will need to obtain additional regulatory approvals, which will be expensive and may not be granted.\nWe have received regulatory approval for Jeuveau® in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. The terms of that approval\nrestrict our ability to market or advertise Jeuveau® for other indications, which could limit aesthetic practitioner and consumer adoption. Under the U.S. Federal\nFood Drug and Cosmetic Act, we may generally only market Jeuveau® for approved indications. Many of our competitors have received approval of multiple\naesthetic and therapeutic indications for their neurotoxin products and may be able to market such products for use in a way we cannot. For example, we are\naware that one of our competitors, AbbVie, has obtained and plans to obtain additional indications for its neurotoxin product within medical aesthetics and,\ntherefore, is able to market its product across a greater number of indications than Jeuveau®. If we are unable to obtain approval for indications in addition to\nour approval for glabellar lines, our marketing efforts for Jeuveau® will be severely limited. As a result, we may not generate aesthetic practitioner and\nconsumer demand or approval of Jeuveau®.\nWe rely on our digital technology and applications and our business and operations could suffer in the event of information system failures or a\ncybersecurity incident.\n52\nTable of Contents\nWe are reliant on our digital technology, including our Evolus Practice App, which allows customers to open a new account, order Jeuveau®, pay invoices and\nengage with our customer experience team and medical affairs representatives. In the event that our digital technology is unable to function in the manner it\nwas designed or at all, we would experience difficulty processing customer orders and requests in a timely manner or at all which would have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe information systems underlying our digital technology may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to\navoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our digital technology is unavailable when customers attempt to access them, or\nif they do not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our technology as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to sell our products through a more\nlimited sales force may be disrupted and we may not realize the efficiencies of leveraging our digital technology, any of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness and financial performance. As the number of users of our digital technology continues to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical\ninfrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale\nand grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our customers’ experience with our digital\ntechnology which may decrease our revenue and harm our results of operations.\nFurther, we rely on third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts,\nincluding, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, and other similar functions. Our ability to\nmonitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place, or\nthey may suffer unexpected power losses or computer system or data network failures that negatively impacts the systems or solutions on which we rely. If our\nthird-party service providers experience a security incident or other type of interruption or if an unexpected flaw or failed software update related to third-party\nsoftware used in our information systems occurs, even if inadvertent, our information systems may become disabled or inaccessible and access to our data and\nother business information may be limited, which could materially disrupt our operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, including our information systems, and those of third parties on which we\nrely, are vulnerable to disruption or damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures,\ncybersecurity incidents, insider threats, persons who access our information systems in an unauthorized manner, or inadvertent misconfiguration of our\nsystems. The risk of a security incident or system disruption, particularly through cybersecurity incidents, including by computer hackers, foreign governments\nand cybercriminals, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have\nincreased. Interruptions in our operations caused by any such event could result in a material disruption of our current or future product development programs.\nThe costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and\nwhile we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be\nsuccessful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, government files or penalties and other harm to our\nbusiness and our competitive position. Interruptions in our operations caused by any such event could also result in a material disruption in our relationship\nwith our customers. For example, if our Evolus Practice App were rendered inoperable, we would have to process orders by telephone or otherwise which may\nresult in slower processing times and harm to our reputation.\nMoreover, a cybersecurity incident that affects our information systems or results in the unauthorized access to financial information, personally identifiable\ninformation (PII), customer information or data, including credit card transaction data or other sensitive information, could materially damage our reputation.\nIn addition, such a security incident may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various international, federal and\nstate privacy and security laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as\namended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009, and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated\nby the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws. Additionally, the regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws\nis increasingly demanding and continues to evolve and a number of states have adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security\npractices regarding the use, disclosure and protection of PII. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, among other things, has created new\nindividual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling PII. In the event of a security incident, we would also be exposed to the risk\nof litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our liability insurance\nmay not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cybersecurity incidents and other related security incidents.\n53\nTable of Contents\nJeuveau® or any future product candidates for which we seek approval as a biologic may face competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the “BPCI Act”) as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\nan abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar or interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal\nauthority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics. Under the BPCI Act, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA\nuntil twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the\nFDA. For example, one company has filed a Citizen Petition requesting that the FDA not apply the BPCI Act to pre-enactment BLAs. As a result, its ultimate\nimpact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement the BPCI Act may be fully\nadopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products.\nWe believe that Jeuveau® should qualify for the twelve-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to\ncongressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider any of our product candidates to be a reference product for competing products, potentially\ncreating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar product, once approved, will be substituted for any\none of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number\nof marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIf we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, or if customers misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to\nprohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, significant fines, penalties, sanctions, or product liability claims, and our image and reputation\nwithin the industry and marketplace could be harmed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about pharmaceutical products, such as Jeuveau®.\nIn particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or other similar regulatory authorities as reflected in the\nproduct’s approved labeling. Customers could use Jeuveau® on their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label of the treatment of\nmoderate to severe glabellar lines, potentially including for the treatment of other aesthetic or therapeutic indications. If we are found to have promoted such\noff-label uses, we may receive warning letters from and be subject to other enforcement actions by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), and\nother regulatory agencies, and become subject to significant liability, which would materially harm our business. The federal government has levied large civil\nand criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we become\nthe target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially\nharm our business. In addition, management’s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred, and our\nreputation could be damaged. The FDA has also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified\npromotional conduct is changed or curtailed in order to resolve FDA enforcement actions. If we are deemed by the FDA to have engaged in the promotion of\nour products for off-label use, we could be subject to the FDA prohibitions or other restrictions on the sale or marketing of our products and other operations or\nsignificant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. In addition, regulatory\nauthorities outside the United States may impose similar fines, penalties or sanctions.\nCustomers may also misuse Jeuveau® or any future product we offer or use improper techniques, potentially leading to adverse results, side effects or injury,\nwhich may lead to product liability claims. If Jeuveau® or any future product candidates are misused or used with improper techniques or are determined to\ncause or contribute to consumer harm, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert\nmanagement’s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance and\nsubject us to negative publicity resulting in reduced sales of our products. Furthermore, the use of Jeuveau® or any future product candidates for indications\nother than those cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among customers and\nconsumers. Any of these events could harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nOur products may cause serious or undesirable side effects or possess other unexpected properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval,\nlimit the commercial profile of approved labeling, result in post-approval regulatory\n54\nTable of Contents\naction or in product liability lawsuits.\nUnforeseen side effects from Jeuveau®, Evolysse™, or any product we may offer in the future could arise either during clinical development or after marketing\nsuch product. Undesirable side effects caused by product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, modify, delay or halt clinical trials and\ncould result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA, the EMA or similar regulatory authorities. Results of clinical\ntrials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, the\nEMA or similar regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of product candidates for any or all targeted indications.\nThe drug or device-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in product liability\nclaims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by Jeuveau®, or any of our future product\ncandidates, after obtaining regulatory approval in the United States or other jurisdictions, a number of potentially negative consequences could result, including\nregulatory authorities withdrawing approval or limiting the marketing of our products, requiring a recall of the product, requiring additional warnings on our\nproduct labeling or medication guides or instituting Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”). In order to mitigate these risks, regulatory authorities\nmay require additional costly clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. As a result of any\nof these actions our sales of the product may decrease significantly, we may be required to expend material amounts to comply with any requirements of the\nregulatory authorities, we could be sued in a product liability lawsuit and held liable for harm caused to patients, and our brand and reputation may suffer.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the commercialization of Jeuveau®, Evolysse™, and any of our future product candidates. For\nexample, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing,\nmarketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers\ninherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted against us under state consumer protection acts. If\nwe cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our\nproducts. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources and result in decreased demand for Jeuveau®, Evolysse™ or\nany future product candidates or products we may develop, termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs, injury to our reputation and significant\nnegative media attention, withdrawal of clinical trial participants or cancellation of clinical trials and significant costs and diversion management’s time to\ndefend the related litigation.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product\nliability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Jeuveau®, Evolysse™, or any future products that we develop. We currently carry product\nliability insurance covering our clinical trials. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment\nor settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance\npolicies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay\nany amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not\nhave, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable\ncost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nAny of the above events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product, negatively impact our revenues and could\nsubstantially increase the costs of commercializing our products. The demand for our products could also be negatively impacted by any adverse effects of a\ncompetitor’s product or treatment.\nOur failure to successfully in-license, acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair our ability to grow\nour business.\nAlthough most of our effort is focused on the commercialization of Jeuveau®, a key element of our long-term strategy is to in-license, acquire, develop, market\nand commercialize a portfolio of products to serve the cash-pay aesthetic market. Jeuveau® is currently our sole commercially available product and\nEvolysse™ has not yet been approved for use by the FDA. Our competitors are currently able to bundle multiple aesthetic products to provide a more\ncomprehensive offering than we can as a single product company. Because our internal research and development capabilities are limited, we may be\ndependent upon pharmaceutical and other companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or\n55\nTable of Contents\ntechnology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify and select promising aesthetic product candidates and products,\nnegotiate licensing or acquisition agreements with their current owners and finance these arrangements.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other\ncompanies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales and other resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of\nproduct candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses\nand technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or licensing opportunities that\nare never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates\non terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nFurther, any product candidates that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical or clinical testing\nand approval by the FDA, the EMA and other similar regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure during product development,\nincluding the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, any\napproved products that we acquire may not be manufactured or sold profitably or achieve market acceptance.\nWe may need to increase the size of our organization, including our sales and marketing capabilities, in order to further market and sell Jeuveau® and to\ncommercialize any product candidates, if approved, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 322 employees, all of whom were full-time employees. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in\nplace may not be adequate to support future growth. Our need to effectively execute our growth strategy requires that we identify, recruit, retain, incentivize\nand integrate any additional employees to effectively manage any future clinical trials, manage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out\nour contractual obligations to third parties, and continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nWe face risks in building and managing a sales organization whether internally or by utilizing third parties, including our ability to retain and incentivize\nqualified individuals, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, generate sufficient sales leads, effectively manage a geographically dispersed\nsales and marketing team, adequately provide complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may otherwise put us at a competitive\ndisadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines, and handle any unforeseen costs and expenses. Any failure or delay in the development\nof our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products.\nDue to our limited financial resources and our limited experience in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively\nmanage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant\ncosts and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our development and\nstrategic objectives or disrupt our operations.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by the impact of geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and\nUkraine and the conflict in the Middle East, on the global economy and capital markets.\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing military conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly\nunpredictable, the conflict has led to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain\ninterruptions, which could continue. The ongoing conflict in the Middle East or other such geopolitical conflicts, particularly in the regions in which we operate\nor seek to expand, could have a similar impact.\nAdditionally, the military conflict in Ukraine has led to the imposition of sanctions and other penalties by the U.S., EU and other countries against Russia.\nRussian military actions and the resulting sanctions have adversely affected the global economy and financial markets and could lead to further instability and\nlack of liquidity in capital markets, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional funds at terms favorable to us, or at all.\n56\nTable of Contents\nAlthough our business has not been materially impacted by the ongoing military conflicts, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or\nthose of our suppliers and manufacturers, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business. The extent\nand duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial.\nOur international operations expose us to risks, and failure to manage these risks may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe currently have operations in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. International operations are subject to a number of inherent risks, and our\nfuture results could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including differences in demand for our products due to local requirements or preferences, the\ndifficulty of hiring and managing employees with cultural and geographic differences and the costs of complying with differing regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, we may experience difficulties and increased costs due to differences in laws related to enforcing contracts, protecting intellectual property, taxes,\ntariffs and export regulations. The current conflict between Ukraine and Russia may also impact European economies and consumer discretionary spending\nnegatively, and the conflict in the Middle East may have similar regional impacts. We do not have significant international operations in Russia, Ukraine, Israel,\nPalestine or the surrounding regions that have been impacted by the conflicts directly.\nOur international operations will also subject us to risks related to multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations,\nincluding the GDPR, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, immigration laws, labor laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental\napprovals, permits and licenses. Additionally, we will face heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or\nfraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements. These and other factors\ncould harm our ability to gain future revenue and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nExchange rate fluctuations may affect the costs that we incur in our operations. The main currencies to which we are exposed to such fluctuations are the\nBritish pound and the EU euro. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue\nto do so in the future. A depreciation of these currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts derived from foreign\noperations reported in our consolidated financial statements, and an appreciation of these currencies will result in a corresponding increase in such amounts.\nThe cost of certain items, such as raw materials, manufacturing, employee salaries and transportation and freight, required by our operations may be affected by\nchanges in the value of the relevant currencies. To the extent that we are required to pay for goods or services in foreign currencies, such as under our Symatese\nU.S. Agreement and Symatese Europe Agreement, which has payments denominated in Euros, the appreciation of such currencies against the U.S. dollar will\ntend to negatively affect our business. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key personnel, we may be unable to market and sell Jeuveau® successfully, or any future products we\ndevelop.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management. We believe that our future success is highly\ndependent upon the contributions of our senior management, particularly David Moatazedi, our President, Chief Executive Officer and member of our Board of\nDirectors, Sandra Beaver, our Chief Financial Officer, Rui Avelar, our Chief Medical Officer and Head of R&D, and Tomoko Yamagishi-Dressler, our Chief\nMarketing Officer, as well as other members of our senior management team. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the\nsuccessful development of our product pipeline, completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of Jeuveau®, Evolysse™ or any future\nproducts we develop.\nIn addition, we could experience difficulties attracting and retaining qualified employees in the future. For example, competition for qualified personnel in the\npharmaceuticals and medical aesthetic field is intense due to the limited number of individuals who possess the skills and experience required by our industry.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may\nbe subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former\nemployers own their research output.\n57\nTable of Contents\nOur strategy of focusing exclusively on the cash-pay healthcare market may limit our ability to increase sales or achieve profitability.\nOur strategy is to focus exclusively on the cash-pay healthcare market. This focus may limit our ability to increase sales or achieve profitability. For example,\nto maintain our business model, we have chosen not to offer products or services available in the broader healthcare market that are reimbursed by third-party\npayors such as Medicare, Medicaid or commercial insurance. This eliminates our ability to offer a substantial number of products and indications for Jeuveau®\nor any future products, such as Evolysse™.\nFor example, under the Daewoong Agreement our rights to market and sell Jeuveau® are limited to cosmetic indications and under the Symatese U.S.\nAgreement and Symatese Europe Agreement our rights are limited to aesthetic and dermatologic uses. Daewoong has subsequently licensed the rights to the\ntherapeutic indications for Jeuveau® to a third party. As a result, we do not have the ability to expand the permitted uses of our products for therapeutic\nindications. Jeuveau® is the only U.S. neurotoxin without a therapeutic indication, although other companies may seek to develop a similar product in the\nfuture. We believe pursuing an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy allows for meaningful strategic advantages in the United States, including\npricing and marketing flexibility. However, customers may choose to not pass any cost benefits received by them due to such pricing flexibility to their\npatients. In addition, companies offering aesthetic products competitive to Jeuveau®, whether they pursue an aesthetic-only non-reimbursed product strategy or\nnot, may nonetheless try to compete with Jeuveau® on price both directly through rebates, promotional programs and coupons and indirectly through attractive\nproduct bundling and customer loyalty programs. Our business, financial results and future prospects will be materially harmed if we cannot generate sufficient\nconsumer demand for Jeuveau®.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we and our third-party manufacturer and supplier must comply with environmental laws and\nregulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur research and development and manufacturing activities in the future may, and our licensors’ manufacturing and supplying activities presently do, involve\nthe controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including botulinum toxin type A, a key component of Jeuveau®, and other hazardous\ncompounds. We and our licensors are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous\nmaterials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our licensors’ facilities pending their use and\ndisposal. We and our licensors cannot eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause an interruption of any of our licensors’ manufacturing processes,\nour commercialization efforts, business operations and environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations\ngoverning the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe that the safety procedures\nutilized by our licensors for handling and disposing of these materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, this may\nnot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such\nliability could exceed our resources, and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and interrupt our business\noperations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent.\nWe may use third-party collaborators to help us develop, validate or commercialize any new products, and our ability to commercialize such products could\nbe impaired or delayed if these collaborations are unsuccessful.\nWe may license or selectively pursue strategic collaborations for the development, validation and commercialization of Jeuveau®, Evolysse™, and any future\nproduct candidates. In any third-party collaboration, we would be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their\ncontinued cooperation. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may\nchoose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development, validation and commercialization\nof our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory\nrequirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Disputes with our collaborators could also impair our reputation or result in\ndevelopment delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.\nIn addition, we may face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend,\namong other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed\ncollaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or\nsimilar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and\n58\nTable of Contents\ncomplexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to consumers, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with\nrespect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and\nmarket conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to\ncollaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Collaborations are complex and time-\nconsuming to negotiate and document.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the\ndevelopment of such product candidate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential\ncommercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization\nactivities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain\nadditional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our\nproduct candidates or bring them to market and generate revenue.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset\nfuture taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), if a\ncorporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the\ncorporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”), and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset\nits post-change income may be limited. As of December 31, 2023, we had $317.7 million of federal NOLs and $227.3 million of state NOLs available to offset\nour future taxable income, if any. As of December 31, 2023, we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of $2.9 million. These federal and\nstate NOLs and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in 2034. We may experience ownership changes in\nthe future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset\nU.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level,\nthere may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nIncreases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability and limit our cash available to fund our growth\nstrategy.\nThe Pharmakon Term Loans have, and any additional debt we subsequently incur may have, a variable rate of interest. Higher interest rates could increase debt\nservice requirements on our current variable rate indebtedness (even though the amount borrowed remains the same) and on any debt we subsequently incur,\nand could reduce funds available for operations, future business opportunities or other purposes and materially and adversely affect our profitability, cash flows\nand results of operations.\nOn May 9, 2023, we and Pharmakon entered into the Third Amendment to the Loan Agreement. Among other changes, the Third Amendment implements the\ntransition from a London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based interest rate to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based interest rate. SOFR is\ncalculated differently from LIBOR and since the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes\nin comparable benchmark or market rates. It is possible that SOFR over time may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative data. It\nis possible that the volatility of and uncertainty around SOFR as a LIBOR replacement rate and the applicable credit adjustment would result in higher\nborrowing costs for us, and could adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and earnings. The consequences of these developments with respect to\nLIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which may negatively\nimpact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Our Licensors\nWe rely on the Daewoong Agreement, the Symatese U.S. Agreement and the Symatese Europe Agreement and any termination or loss of significant rights,\nincluding exclusivity, under these agreements would materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to exclusively commercialize Jeuveau® and Evolysse™ are completely dependent on the Daewoong Agreement, the Symatese U.S. Agreement and\nSymatese Europe Agreement, respectively. Under each agreement we have numerous\n59\nTable of Contents\nobligations, including minimum product purchases, milestone payments and commercialization and development obligations. If we breach any material\nobligation, our partners may terminate or decrease our rights under the agreements. If we were to lose rights under the Daewoong Agreement, or either of the\nSymatese Agreements, we would experience an immediate reduction in our revenues and future business opportunities. We believe it would be difficult to find\nan alternative supplier of these products. In addition, to the extent the alternative supplier has not secured regulatory approvals in a jurisdiction, we would have\nto expend significant resources to obtain regulatory approvals that may never be obtained or require several years to obtain, which could significantly delay\ncommercialization. We may be unable to raise additional capital to fund our operations during this extended time on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nAdditionally, if we experience delays as a result of a dispute with either of our partners the demand for our products could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe currently rely solely on Daewoong to manufacture Jeuveau® and on Symatese to manufacture Evolysse™ and as such, any production or other\nproblems with either licensor could adversely affect us.\nWe depend solely upon Daewoong for the manufacturing of Jeuveau® and on Symatese to manufacture Evolysse™. Although alternative sources of supply may\nexist, the number of third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities is limited, and it could be expensive and take\na significant amount of time to arrange for and qualify alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Suppliers of any new\nproduct candidate would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual\nproperty laws to the method of manufacturing the product candidate. Obtaining the necessary FDA approvals or other qualifications under applicable\nregulatory requirements and ensuring non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could\nrequire the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us.\nIn addition, our reliance on Daewoong and Symatese entails additional risks, including reliance on our partners for regulatory compliance and quality\nassurance, the possible breach of either the Daewoong Agreement by Daewoong or the Symatese U.S. Agreement and Symatese Europe Agreement by\nSymatese, and the possible termination or nonrenewal of either agreement at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Our failure, or the failure of our\npartners, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or\nwithdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly\nand adversely affect supplies of our products. Our dependence on our partners also subjects us to all of the risks related to our partner’s business, which are all\ngenerally beyond our control. Our partners’ ability to perform their obligations under their respective agreements is dependent on their operational and financial\nhealth, which could be negatively impacted by several factors, including changes in the economic, political and legislative conditions in their home countries\nand the broader region in general and the ability of our partners to continue to successfully attract customers and compete in its market.\nAdditionally, we are dependent on our licensors for day-to-day compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) for production of our products.\nFacilities used by our licensors to produce the drug substance, devices and materials or finished products for commercial sale must pass inspection and be\napproved by the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities. If the safety of our products is compromised due to a failure to adhere to applicable laws or for\nother reasons, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product and we may be held liable for injuries sustained as a result. In addition, the\nmanufacturing facilities of certain of our suppliers are located outside of the United States. This may give rise to difficulties in importing our product into the\nUnited States or other countries as a result of, among other things, regulatory agency approval requirements, taxes, tariffs, local import requirements such as\nimport duties or inspections, incomplete or inaccurate import documentation or defective packaging. Any of these factors could adversely impact our ability to\neffectively market and sell our products.\nAny failure or refusal by our licensors or any other third party to supply our products that we may develop could delay, prevent or impair our clinical\ndevelopment or commercialization efforts.\nMoreover, our licensors developed the manufacturing process for our products in facilities outside the United States. If these facilities were to be damaged,\ndestroyed or otherwise unable to operate or comply with regulatory requirements, whether due to earthquakes, fire, floods, hurricanes, storms, tornadoes, other\nnatural disasters, public health emergencies, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages or otherwise, or if operations at the facility is disrupted for\nany other reason, such an event could jeopardize our licensors’ ability to manufacture our products as promptly as we or our customers expect or possibly at all.\nIf our licensors are unable to manufacture our products within a timeframe that meets our and our customers’ expectations, our business, prospects, financial\nresults and reputation could be materially harmed. Any disaster recovery and business continuity plans that we and our licensors may have in place or put in\nplace may not be adequate in the event of a\n60\nTable of Contents\nserious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of our or our licensors’ lack of disaster recovery and business continuity plans,\nor the adequacy thereof, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe forecast the demand for commercial quantities of our products, and if our forecasts are inaccurate, we may experience delays in shipments, increased\ninventory costs or inventory levels, and reduced cash flow.\nWe purchase our products from our licensors, Daewoong and, subject to regulatory approval, Symatese. Pursuant to our agreements with our licensors, we are\nobligated to submit forecasts of anticipated product orders and may, from time to time, submit purchase orders on the basis of these forecasting requirements.\nFor a variety of reasons we may not be able to accurately predict future demand. In addition, we expect our licensors to manufacture our products for other\nmarkets in which we do not have exclusive rights. If our business significantly expands, our demand for commercial products would increase and our licensors\nmay be unable to meet our increased demand. In addition, our products have fixed future expiration dates. If we overestimate demand for our products, we will\nhave excess inventory, which may have to be disposed of if such inventory exceeds approved expiration dates, which would result in lost revenues and increase\nour expenses. If we underestimate requirements for our products, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt, delay or prevent delivery of our\nproducts to our customers. Any of these occurrences would negatively affect our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our commercialization efforts and interrupt our supply of products.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the proprietary rights of third parties. Competitors in the field of dermatology,\nmedical aesthetic and neurotoxins have developed large portfolios of patents and patent applications in fields relating to our business. In particular, there are\npatents held by third parties that relate to the treatment with neurotoxin-based products for the indication we are currently marketing. There may also be patent\napplications that have been filed but not published that, when issued as patents, could be asserted against us. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both\nwithin and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the technology, medical device and pharmaceutical industries,\nincluding patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter-party reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n(“USPTO”). Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are\ndeveloping Jeuveau®. As the technology, medical device and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product\ncandidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we or any of our current or future licensors, including Daewoong, are employing their proprietary technology without\nauthorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the\nuse or manufacture of Jeuveau® or any future product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending\npatent applications that may later result in issued patents that Jeuveau® or any future product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain\npatents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent\njurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of Jeuveau® or any future product candidates, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to\ncommercialize such product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent\nwere held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop\nand commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtain a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available\non commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn addition to claims of patent infringement, third parties may bring claims against us asserting misappropriation of proprietary technology or other information\nin the development, manufacture and commercialization of Jeuveau® or any of our future product candidates. Defense of such a claim would require dedicated\ntime and resources, which time and resources could otherwise be used by us toward the maintenance of our own intellectual property and the development and\ncommercialization of Jeuveau® and any of our future product candidates or by any of our current or future licensors for operational upkeep and manufacturing\nof our products. For example, prior to entering into the Medytox Settlement Agreement, we were a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Medytox in the Superior\nCourt of the State of California (the “Medytox Litigation”), and a respondent in the ITC Action, each alleging, among other things, that Daewoong stole\nMedytox’s botulinum toxin bacterial (“BTX”) strain, that Daewoong misappropriated certain trade secrets of Medytox, including the process used to\nmanufacture Jeuveau® (which Medytox claims is similar to its biopharmaceutical drug, Meditoxin) using the BTX strain, and that Daewoong thereby interfered\nwith Medytox’s plan to license Meditoxin to us.\n61\nTable of Contents\nEach of the Medytox Litigation and the ITC Action diverted the attention of our senior management and were costly, in terms of legal costs and the ultimate\npayments and royalties to be paid under the Medytox Settlement Agreement.\nAdditionally, we are aware that multiple entrants into the injectable hyaluronic acid market have faced litigation related to allegations of intellectual property\ninfringement and have either expended large amounts of money to defend these claims, attempted to invalidate a third-party’s intellectual property as a defense,\nor have entered into settlement and license agreements in order to commercialize their injectable hyaluronic acid products. As the importer of record and\ncommercial distributor of Evolysse™, we may be required to defend these cases, which may result in increased legal costs and royalty costs.\nParties making claims against us or any of our current or future licensors may request and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively\nblock our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve\nsubstantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement,\nwe or any of our current or future licensors may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, obtain\none or more licenses from third parties which may not be commercially or more available, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products or manufacturing\nprocesses, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to\nobtain licenses from third parties to advance our research, manufacture clinical trial supplies or allow commercialization of our products or any future product\ncandidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop\nand commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. Similarly, third-party patents could exist that might be\nenforced against our products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties\nand/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nIf we or any of our current or future licensors, including Daewoong and Symatese, are unable to maintain, obtain or protect intellectual property rights\nrelated to our products, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe and our current licensors, Daewoong and Symatese, currently rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements\nand proprietary know-how. Botulinum toxin cannot be patented, as it is produced by Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-\nforming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce the neurotoxin botulinum. Only the manufacturing process for botulinum toxin can be patented, for which\nDaewoong has obtained a U.S. patent. Our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information and those of our licensors could be disclosed or\ncompetitors could otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of\nsome foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we or any of our\ncurrent or future licensors may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our or their intellectual property both in the United States and\ninternationally. If we or any of our current or future licensors are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our\nproducts to third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by trademarks, confidentiality agreements and proprietary know-how, we may in the future rely upon in-licensed patents\nfor any future product offerings. The strength of patents we may in-license in the technology and healthcare fields involves complex legal and scientific\nquestions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we may in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover any of our future\nproduct candidates in the United States or in other foreign countries, and the issued patents that we may in-license may be declared invalid or unenforceable.\nWe are reliant on the ability of our licensors, to maintain their intellectual property and protect their intellectual property against misappropriation, infringement\nor other violation. We may not have primary control over our future licensors’ patent prosecution activities. Furthermore, we may not be allowed to comment\non prosecution strategies, and patent applications may be abandoned by the patent owner without our knowledge or consent. With respect to patents that are\nissued to our licensors, or patents that may be issued on patent applications, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result\nin such patents being narrowed or invalidated. As a licensee, we are reliant on Daewoong, Symatese, and our future licensors to defend any third-party claims.\nOur licensors may not defend or prosecute such actions as vigorously or in the manner that we would have if entitled to do so, and we will be subject to any\njudgment or settlement resulting from such actions. Also, a third-party may challenge the validity of our in-licensing transactions. Furthermore, even\n62\nTable of Contents\nif they are unchallenged, any of our future in-licensed patents and patent applications may not adequately protect the licensors or our intellectual property or\nprevent others from designing around their or our claims.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property or the patents and other intellectual property of our licensors, which\ncould be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property, including any future patents we may acquire, or the patents and other intellectual property of our licensors,\nincluding Daewoong or Symatese. As a result, we or any of our current or future licensors may be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party\ninfringement or unauthorized use. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement\nproceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or any of our current or future licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other\nparty from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction\nagainst an infringer are not satisfied.\nAn adverse determination of any litigation or other proceedings could put one or more of such patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.\nInterference, derivation or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to\nany of our future patent applications or those of our licensors or collaborators. Litigation or USPTO proceedings brought by us or any of our current or future\nlicensors may fail or may be invoked against us or our licensors by third parties. Even if we are successful, domestic or foreign litigation or USPTO or foreign\npatent office proceedings may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management or the management of any of our current or future licensors,\nincluding Daewoong or Symatese. We may not be able, alone or with any of our current or future licensors or collaborators, to prevent misappropriation of our\nproprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that\nsome of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or proceedings. In addition, during the course of this\nkind of litigation or proceedings, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or\npublic access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nMost of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. They are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex\npatent litigation longer than we could. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating\nour intellectual property. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our\nclinical trials, continue our internal research programs, or in-license needed technology or other product candidates. There could also be public announcements\nof the results of the hearing, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive those results to be negative, it\ncould cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual\nproperty rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries\ndo not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States and in some cases may even force us to grant a\ncompulsory license to competitors or other third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our inventions in all countries\noutside the United States or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may\nuse our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing\nproducts to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our\nproducts and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of\ncertain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those\nrelating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of\nour proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and\nattention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted\n63\nTable of Contents\nnarrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that\nwe initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIn addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in domestic and foreign\nintellectual property laws.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary\ninformation, to maintain our competitive position.\nWe seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our\nemployees, collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We expect to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our\nemployees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade\nsecrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade\nsecret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts within and outside the United States are less\nwilling or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would\nhave no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets\nwere to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of\nthird parties.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical or medical aesthetic companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our\nemployees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees’ former\nemployers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents.\nLitigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. We may not be successful in defending these claims, and even if we are successful, litigation could\nresult in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to\nhire employees. A loss of key personnel or their work product could diminish or prevent our ability to commercialize product candidates, which could have an\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable\nterms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of Evolysse™ or our future product\ncandidates including certain formulations and methods of production of these products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology\nof third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially\nreasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our\nbusiness may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on\nother marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or\ncustomers in our markets of interest. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may\nnot be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected.\nThird parties may assert that we are using trademarks or trade names that are confusingly similar to their marks. If any third party were able to establish that\nour trademarks or trade names were infringing their marks, that third party may be able to block our ability to use the infringing trademark or trade name. In\naddition, if a third party were to bring such a claim, we\n64\nTable of Contents\nwould be required to dedicate time and resources to fight the claim, which time and resources could otherwise be used toward the maintenance of our own\nintellectual property.\nParties making claims against us may request and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could prevent our ability to use the subject trademarks or\ntrade names. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee\nresources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages\nand attorneys’ fees for willful infringement. We may be required to re-brand one or more of our products, product candidates, or services offered under the\ninfringing trademark or trade name, which may require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Third parties could claim senior rights in marks which\nmight be enforced against our use of trademarks or trade names, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales under those trademarks or trade names.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur business and products are subject to extensive government regulation.\nWe are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States, the EU, Canada,\nAustralia and other countries, principally by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the EMA\nand other similar regulatory authorities. Our partners Daewoong and Symatese are also subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and their own country’s\nregulatory authorities as well as other regulatory authorities. Our failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, or our partner’s failure to\ncomply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act,\nand the Controlled Substances Act, may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution, monetary penalties and other enforcement or\nadministrative actions, including, sanctions, warnings, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension, revocation of approvals, or exclusion from\nfuture participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nFollowing regulatory approval, we, and our direct and indirect suppliers, including Daewoong and Symatese, remain subject to the periodic inspection of our\nplants and facilities, review of production processes, and testing of our products to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. Adverse\nfindings during regulatory inspections may result in requirements that we implement REMS programs, requirements that we complete government mandated\nclinical trials, and government enforcement actions including those relating to labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion, as well as regulations governing\nmanufacturing controls.\nIf we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates\nmay be harmed and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nWe may not obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of any of our current and future product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug and biologic products, such as our\nneurotoxin product, and medical devices, such as our Evolysse™ injectable hyaluronic acid product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA\nand other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. If we, our products or the\nmanufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n• impose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspend or withdraw product approvals or revoke necessary licenses;\n• issue warning letters, show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available;\n• mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to aesthetic practitioners;\n• require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due\ndates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n• commence criminal investigations and prosecutions;\n• impose injunctions;\n65\nTable of Contents\n• impose other civil or criminal penalties;\n• suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n• delay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n• refuse to permit drugs or active ingredients to be imported or exported;\n• suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n• seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nAny of the foregoing could materially harm our business and reputation. Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States\nor abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA\nor other similar foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and\nclinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we and our collaborators believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are\npromising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA, the EMA and other similar regulatory authorities. Administering product\ncandidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA, the EMA or other similar\nregulatory authorities delaying or denying approval of a product candidate for any or all targeted indications.\nRegulatory approval of a BLA or BLA supplement, PMA, marketing authorization application (“MAA”), or other product approval is not guaranteed, and the\napproval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval\nprocess. Despite the time and expense expended, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon, modify or repeat\nclinical trials, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for the FDA,\nthe EMA or other regulatory approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition that the product candidate is designed to address and\nthe regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a\nproduct candidate for many reasons, including the following:\n• a product candidate may not be deemed safe, effective, pure or potent;\n• the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be deemed sufficient;\n• the FDA or other regulatory authorities might not approve our third-party manufacturers’ processes or facilities;\n• deficiencies in the formulation, quality control, labeling, or specifications of a product candidate or in response to citizen petitions or similar\ndocuments filed in connection with the product candidate;\n• general requirements intended to address risks associated with a class of drugs, such as a new REMS requirement for neurotoxins, injectable\nhyaluronic acid gels or other aesthetic products;\n• the enactment of new laws or promulgation of new regulations that change the approval requirements; or\n• the FDA or other regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nIf any future product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials or do not gain approval, our business and results of operations will be\nmaterially and adversely harmed.\nWe are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense, limit or delay\nregulatory approval and subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nJeuveau® and, subject to regulatory approval in the United States, Evolysse™ and any other products that are approved in the future, are subject to continual\nregulatory review by the FDA, the EMA and other similar regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approvals that we or our collaborators receive for any future\nproduct candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indications for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or\ncontain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and\n66\nTable of Contents\nefficacy of the product. In addition, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and\nrecordkeeping for Jeuveau® and any other future product candidates, such as Evolysse™, will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements.\nThese requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP\nrequirements and compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of\npreviously unknown problems with Jeuveau® or any future product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our\nthird-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: restrictions on the\nmarketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; fines, warning letters or\nholds on clinical trials; refusal by the FDA, the EMA or other similar regulatory authorities to approve pending applications or supplements to approved\napplications filed by us or our strategic collaborators or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; product seizure or detention or refusal to permit\nthe import or export of products; and injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur ongoing regulatory requirements may also change from time to time, potentially harming or making costlier our commercialization efforts. If we are slow\nor unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance,\nwe may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions for Jeuveau® or any future product candidates, we will be unable to market our products\noutside of the United States.\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials,\ncommercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the\nproduct by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval\nprocedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain\nFDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure\napproval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory\nauthorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA\napproval. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or to do so on a timely basis, and even if we do file, we may not receive necessary approvals to\ncommercialize our products in markets outside of the United States.\nJeuveau® or any future products may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory agencies and if we fail to do\nso, we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nSome participants in our clinical trials have reported adverse events after being treated with Jeuveau®. As we commercialize Jeuveau® or any other product\ncandidate, including Evolysse™, the FDA and other regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if\nthose products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware\nof the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events that we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may\nalso fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse\nevent that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA, the EMA or other\nsimilar regulatory authorities could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in\napproval or clearance of future products.\nWe may in the future be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral,\nfalse claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nWhile we do not expect that Jeuveau® or Evolysse™ will subject us to the various U.S. federal and most state laws intended to prevent health care fraud and\nabuse, we may in the future become subject to such laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or\nto induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care\nprograms. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and\nservices. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as\n67\nTable of Contents\nprivate payors. Violations of anti-kickback and other applicable laws can result in exclusion from federal health care programs and substantial civil and\ncriminal penalties.\nThe federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for\npayment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that\nare for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. The FCA includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to\nbring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims. Some state law equivalents of the above federal\nlaws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA, apply to items or services regardless of whether the good or service was reimbursed by a government\nprogram, so called all-payor laws. These all-payor laws could apply to our sales and marketing activities even if the Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA laws are\ninapplicable.\nIf our marketing or other arrangements were determined to violate anti-kickback or related laws, including the FCA or an all-payor law, then we could be\nsubject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state\nhealthcare programs, individual imprisonment or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially and adversely affect our\nability to operate our business and our financial results.\nState and federal authorities have aggressively targeted pharmaceutical companies for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes, based on improper\nresearch or consulting contracts with doctors, certain marketing arrangements with pharmacies and other healthcare providers that rely on volume-based\npricing, off-label marketing schemes, and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines, have\nbeen ordered to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have in many cases become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in\nwhich they conduct their business, among other consequences. Additionally, federal and state regulators have brought criminal actions against individual\nemployees responsible for alleged violations. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our contractual relationships with\nproviders or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business.\nAlso, the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S.\nofficials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or negligent acts\ncommitted by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in\nfines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the United States and other countries may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory\nclearance or approval of any future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in the U.S. Congress or other countries that could significantly change the statutory provisions\ngoverning the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, regulations and\nguidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any\nnew regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future product candidates.\nSuch changes could, among other things, require changes to manufacturing or marketing methods, changes to product labeling or promotional materials, recall,\nreplacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and additional recordkeeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or\nfailure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n68\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nSecurities class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our officers and directors, which could result in substantial costs\nand could divert management attention.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 1. “Legal Proceedings” we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit and we\nare a nominal defendant in derivative lawsuits filed against certain of our officers and directors. We maintain director and officer’s insurance coverage and\ncontinue to engage in vigorous defense of such litigation. If we are not successful in our defense of such litigation, we could be forced to make significant\npayments to or other settlements with our stockholders and their lawyers outside of our insurance coverage, and such payments or settlement arrangements\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. We may also be the target of this type of litigation in the future, as\ncompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities act litigation. Even if the claims asserted in these\nlawsuits are not successful, the litigation could result in substantial costs and significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management’s attention\nand resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is volatile. For example, the closing price of our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 has ranged from a low of\n$9.99 to a high of $17.49. The stock market in general and the market for earlier stage pharmaceutical and medical aesthetic companies in particular have\nexperienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may\nbe influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n• changes in financial estimates or guidance, including our ability to meet our future revenue and operating profit or loss estimates or guidance;\n• the public’s reaction to our earnings releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC or those of companies that are perceived to be\nsimilar to us;\n• variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n• any termination or loss of rights under the Daewoong Agreement, the Symatese U.S. Agreement or the Symatese Europe Agreement;\n• adverse developments in the regulatory approval process for Evolysse™;\n• the FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory or legal actions or changes affecting us or our industry;\n• adverse developments concerning our manufacturer or any future strategic partnerships;\n• adverse developments affecting our compliance with the Medytox Settlement Agreement;\n• adverse developments concerning litigation pending against us;\n• introductions and announcements of new technologies and products by us, any commercialization partners or our competitors, and the timing of these\nintroductions and announcements;\n• success or failure of competitive products or medical aesthetic products generally;\n• announcements of results of clinical trials or regulatory approval or disapproval of product candidates;\n• unanticipated safety concerns related to the use of Jeuveau® or any of our future products;\n• changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic partnerships, new product approvals and introductions, joint\nventures or capital commitments;\n69\nTable of Contents\n• overall financial market conditions for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical sectors and issuance of securities analysts’ reports or\nrecommendations;\n• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n• short selling of our common stock or the publication of opinions regarding our business prospects in a manner that is designed to create negative\nmarket momentum;\n• sales of substantial amounts of our stock by Medytox and Daewoong or other significant stockholders or our insiders, or the expectation that such\nsales might occur;\n• news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in medical aesthetics market or the pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical industry;\n• operating and stock performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us and overall performance of the equity markets;\n• additions or departures of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Medical Officer and Chief Marketing\nOfficer;\n• intellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us, our manufacturer or other parties on which we rely or litigation against our general\nindustry;\n• changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities and the incurrence of additional debt;\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n• economic conditions in the markets in which we operate; and\n• other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical aesthetics companies in particular, have experienced\nextreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and\nindustry factors may affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in\nthe overall market and the market prices of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company.\nWe may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our\nmanagement’s attention and resources from our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock by us or others, or the perception that such sales may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales by us of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could significantly\nreduce the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nAdditionally, the shares of common stock held by Medytox are subject to contractual restrictions on transfer that, subject to certain limited exceptions such as\ntransfers to affiliates prohibit Medytox from transferring more than 75% of the shares it holds prior to September 16, 2025, with such contractual restrictions\nterminating on September 16, 2025. Subject to the restrictions described above, the sale by Medytox or Daewoong of a substantial number of shares of our\ncommon stock, or a perception that such sales could occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe have filed a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC covering shares of our common stock available for future issuance under our 2017 Omnibus\nIncentive Plan and 2023 Inducement Incentive Plan and may file future registration statements covering shares of our common stock for future issuance under\nany future plans. Upon effectiveness of such registration statements, any shares subsequently issued under such plans will be eligible for sale in the public\nmarket, except to the extent that they are restricted by the contractual arrangements discussed above and subject to compliance with Rule 144 in the case of our\naffiliates. We have also filed a registration statement on Form S-3 covering the offering and sale from time to time of shares of our common stock and certain\nother securities, which we used to complete our March 2024 follow-on offering as well as to register the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to our\nATM Program. Sales of a large\n70\nTable of Contents\nnumber of the shares issued under these plans in the public market, or a perception that such sales could occur, could significantly reduce the market price of\nour common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, could discourage a takeover.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover and might make it more\ndifficult for an investor to acquire a substantial block of our common stock. These include the following provisions:\n• permit our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, without stockholder\napproval, which could be used to dilute the ownership of a hostile bidder significantly;\n• provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our Board of Directors and that a director may only be removed\nfor cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock;\n• provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n• divide our Board of Directors into three classes, with each class serving staggered three-year terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to\nchange the membership of a majority of our Board of Directors;\n• require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by\nwritten consent;\n• provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting\nof stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice,\nwhich may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise\nattempting to obtain control of our company;\n• prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates; and\n• provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer or by our\nBoard of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors, which may delay the ability of our\nstockholders to force consideration by our company of a take-over proposal or to take certain corporate actions, including the removal of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for\nstockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to\nSection 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”), which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any\nof a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or\ncombining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock,\nunless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change-of-control,\nwhether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from\nacquiring us or merging with us.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and\nproceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be\nthe sole and exclusive forum for all “internal corporate claims.” “Internal corporate claims” are\n71\nTable of Contents\nclaims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer or stockholder in such capacity, or as to which Title 8 of the DGCL\nconfers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court of Chancery”), in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having\npersonal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants and the claim not being one which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or\nforum other than the Court of Chancery, or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. For example, this choice of forum\nprovision would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive\njurisdiction. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have\nconsented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation. The choice of forum provision in our certificate of incorporation will not relieve us of our duties\nto comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance\nwith these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our\ndirectors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an\naction, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in\npursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than\nwould other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such\njudgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our certificate of incorporation\ninapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with\nresolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce\nthe amount of money available to us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we can indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware\nlaw. Separate indemnity agreements have been issued with each director and executive officer.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and\nofficers, among other things provide that:\n• We have indemnified our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities, or for serving as a director, officer, employee or agent of other\nbusiness enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that we may indemnify such person if such\nperson acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interest and, with respect to any\ncriminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful.\n• We may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n• We will be required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such\ndirectors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n• The rights conferred in our bylaws will not be exclusive. We may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification\nobligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nAs a result, claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may\nreduce the amount of money available to us.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nStockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert\ninfluence on our Board of Directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict\n72\nTable of Contents\nwith our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our Board of Directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial\ncondition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and\nrequire significant time and attention by our Board of Directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or\nsenior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in\nthe loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel\nand business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our Board of Directors\nwith a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We\nmay choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a\nfurther distraction to our Board of Directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those\ndescribed above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not\nnecessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research about our business or decrease the frequency or cease to provide coverage of our company,\nour stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. If one or\nmore of the equity research analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or issues other unfavorable commentary or research the price of our common\nstock may decline. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common\nstock could decrease, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our\nstock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and the\npayment of dividends is also restricted under our credit facility. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial\ncondition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends,\ncapital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe requirements of being a public company has and may continue to strain our resources, divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract\nand retain executive management and qualified Board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act, the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Complying with these rules and regulations will\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and\nresources, particularly since we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, or a “smaller reporting company” as defined by the\nExchange Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating\nresults. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\nreporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this\nstandard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns,\nwhich could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to assist us in\ncomplying with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies,\nincreasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying\ninterpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions\nto disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result\nin increased selling, general and administrative expenses and a\n73\nTable of Contents\ndiversion of our management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws,\nregulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice,\nregulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\n74\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

This presentation includes references to “Non-GAAP operating\nincome” which excludes the revaluation of contingent royalty obligations, stock-based compensation expense, and depreciation and amortization. “Non-GAAP\noperating expenses” are operating expenses excluding product cost of sales, revaluation of contingent royalty obligations, stock-based compensation expense,\nand depreciation and amortization. Management believes that non-GAAP operating expenses are useful in helping to identify the company’s core operating\nperformance and enables management to consistently analyze the period-to-period financial performance of the core business operations. Management also\nbelieves that non-GAAP operating expenses will enable investors to assess the company in the same way that management has historically assessed the\ncompany’s operating expenses against comparable companies with conventional accounting methodologies. The company’s definitions of adjusted gross profit\nmargin, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating expenses have limitations as analytical tools and may differ from other companies reporting\nsimilarly named measures. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered superior to and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\nGAAP financial measures. Due to the forward-looking nature of the non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating expenses outlook disclosed in this\npresentation, no reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is available without unreasonable efforts. This is due to\nthe inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various reconciling items that would impact the forward-looking non-GAAP operating income and non-\nGAAP operating expenses, that have not yet occurred and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Such unavailable information could have a significant impact on the\ncompany’s GAAP financial results.\n37"
