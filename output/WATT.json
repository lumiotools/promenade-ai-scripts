The transmitter deploys higher levels of continuous power with more bi-directional data and supply chain visibility. \n\nIn addition to providing energy, the Energous 2W PowerBridge transmitter acts as data links for IoT-enabled devices such as sensors and tags, allowing them to efficiently communicate data and insights back to the cloud–without the need for batteries, wires, or cables. With this information, companies can analyze, optimize, and improve every aspect of supply chain operations in real-time. \n\nThe system combines two Energous EN3210 high-efficiency power amplifiers with an Energous EN4100 System-on-Chip (SoC) RF transmitter. The proprietary antenna design enables it to transmit higher radiated power—up to 8W Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP)—with dual polarization, delivering up to 99 percent visibility of all connected devices. It’s this capability that allows the Energous solution to meet the increasing demand for power over distance, which is crucial for applications where asset tracking and monitoring across multiple zones is critical to operations, including cold chain monitoring, fleet management, and temperature and humidity monitoring. \n\n“We designed our 2W PowerBridge transmitter system to help companies reduce losses and improve operational efficiencies. By delivering continuous access to wireless power, over-the-air and at a distance, we can enable a constant stream of real-time data for all IoT-enabled devices in the supply chain,” said Mallorie Burak, CEO and CFO, Energous Wireless Power Solutions. “It’s an honor to receive the ‘IoT Innovation of the Year’ award from Mobile Breakthrough. This recognition underscores our commitment to advancing wireless power technology by building a more sustainable future and pushing the boundaries of power at a distance.” \n\nThe mission of the annual Mobile Breakthrough Awards is to honor excellence and recognize the innovation, hard work and success in a range of mobile and wireless technology categories, including Cloud Computing, Mobile Management, Wireless and Broadband, Mobile Analytics, IoT and Smart City and many more. This year’s program included thousands of nominations from over 15 different countries throughout the world. \n\n“The Energous 2W PowerBridge transmitter is a game-changer for companies with complex supply chains and IoT systems. RFID-based systems are incredibly expensive, and most sensor solutions are unstainable with over 100 batteries added to landfills every second,” stated Steve Johansson, Managing Director, Mobile Breakthrough. “This level of visibility from Energous not only enables improved decision-making and traceability of products and materials but also helps to reduce waste and improve supply chain sustainability. By distributing power and network connectivity without the need for wires or batteries, these transmitter systems represent a breakthrough in large-scale IoT.” \n\n**About Energous Wireless Power Solutions**\n\nEnergous Corporation d/b/a Energous Wireless Power Solutions (NASDAQ: WATT) is pioneering scalable, over-the-air (OTA) wireless power networks that enable unprecedented levels of visibility, control, and intelligent business automation.

The transmitters, which are ruggedized and weatherproof, are purpose built for commercial transportation applications, allowing real time inventory tracking during distribution. This deployment follows the retailer’s [previous orders](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fenergous.com%2Fcompany%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews%2Fenergous-receives-multiple-orders-from-multinational-retailer-for-grocery-distribution%2F&esheet=54132242&newsitemid=20241008125008&lan=en-US&anchor=previous+orders&index=2&md5=c947092ea6dd5988dbf7c632703cc766) of Energous 2W PowerBridge transmitters for its grocery distribution centers. \n\nIn legacy supply chain management systems, data is typically tracked manually with bar code scanners or paper documents, leading to information gaps and errors. As more retailers use Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices such as scanners and tags to track products, they can create smart supply chains which improve efficiency, customer service, and profitability. Energous PowerBridge transmitter systems provide a WPN that delivers an always-on, OTA, automated energy flow that optimizes IoT device performance, enabling the retailer to digitally monitor their transportation network 24/7/365. As a result, distribution becomes more efficient, and they can proactively address shipment issues, whether on the road or in a warehouse, in real time. \n\n“This shipment of our 1W transmitters not only establishes the foundation for a new WPN that will enhance this retailer’s transportation network visibility and control, but also strengthens our existing relationship with them, given their use of our 2W transmitters for grocery distribution optimization,” said Mallorie Burak, Interim Principal Executive Officer and CFO, Energous Wireless Power Solutions. “Our wireless power solutions are safe and cost-effective, providing companies with operational infrastructures that are always on, enabling a constant stream of real-time data, and delivering up to 99 percent visibility of all tracked assets and inventory, from the warehouse to the store. \n\n“Energous PowerBridge transmitters are also ecofriendly. As we all work toward a more sustainable future, Energous-powered WPNs will help retailers reduce the carbon footprint of their distribution and reduce food waste, while helping ensure their customers receive the freshest possible food.” \n\n**About Energous Wireless Power Solutions**\n\nEnergous PowerBridge transmitter systems are the backbone of WPNs that allow connected devices such as sensors and tags to continuously provide critical enterprise data to cloud networks—at distance and without wires, batteries, or cables—ensuring they are reliably charged at all times. In addition, these transmitter systems act as data links for IoT-enabled devices, enabling them to efficiently communicate valuable data and insights back to the cloud, and allowing companies to analyze, optimize, and improve every part of their supply chain operations in real time. \n\nThe Energous 1W PowerBridge transmitter system is a cost-efficient WPN solution that works with a variety of energy harvesting Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors. The IP67-rated transmitter can be easily mounted on a wall or vehicle, making it ideal for applications which require location tracking systems in compact spaces with exposure to water and dust, including cold chain monitoring, fleet management, and temperature and humidity monitoring. \n\nThe Energous 1W PowerBridge transmitter system combines a high-efficiency power amplifier with a System-on-Chip (SoC) RF transmitter to create a wireless charging infrastructure that enables continuous data streams from mobile IoT devices into business critical applications.
