The CDIs can now be freely exchanged for the underlying ordinary shares within the CREST system and all restrictions or cross-border exchanges have been lifted\n\n##### Information for holders in certificated form\n\nFor persons who currently hold Ordinary Shares in certificated form, these shareholders will shortly receive a “DRS Statement” from the Company’s US transfer agent. The DRS Statement will explain how to dematerialise the underlying shares into a trading account. Please note that as each new ordinary share results from a 65 into 1 share consolidation, the holding on the DRS will represent the former certificated holdings divided by a factor of 65 and rounded down to the nearest whole share. You do not need to return your original share certificate to the Company.\n\n##### How do I move my shares to my broker if I have received a Direct Registration System (DRS) statement?\n\n**If you wish to transfer your shares to a U.S. bank or broker, follow the steps below:**\n\n  1. Send a copy of your DRS Statement to your broker.\n  2. Your broker will set up what is known as a “DRS Profile” to sweep the shares from Worldwide Stock Transfer account based on the information in the DRS Statement.\n  3. Overnight, the shares will automatically sweep out of the Worldwide Stock Transfer account to your broker.\n  4. Your broker will internally allocate the shares to your personal account at that broker.\n\n\n\n**If you wish to transfer your shares to a non-U.S. bank or broker, follow the steps below:**\n\n  1. Send a copy of your DRS statement to your local broker and advise them that they need to set up a “DRS Profile” (and no other type of trade) to “pull” the shares from Worldwide Stock Transfer in the United States. This is a technical process but given the international nature of securities markets, your broker’s settlement agent will understand the required process.\n  2. The local broker then must interact with their operations team to properly instruct their U.S. clearing agent to set up a DRS Profile request on their behalf based on the information in the DRS Statement.\n\n\n\nNote: The local broker should refer to their U.S. clearing agent for any guidance if they are not clear on the appropriate format of the instruction, as this part of the process is an internal matter.\n\n  * The U.S. clearing agent will set up a DRS Profile to “pull” your shares from Worldwide Stock Transfer account based on the information in the DRS Statement.\n  * Overnight, your shares will automatically sweep out of the Worldwide Stock Transfer account to the U.S. clearing agent.\n  * The U.S. clearing agent will internally allocate your shares to the account of your local broker.\n  * Your local broker will internally allocate the shares to your personal account at your broker.\n\n\n\n##### What do I do if I have not received my DRS statement?\n\nIf you have not received your DRS Statement and you are a certified shareholder or a broker/nominee, please contact us on info@okyopharma.com further assistance. Alternatively, you can contact Worldwide Stock Transfer directly.\n\n##### What do I do if I cannot see my Okyo shares in my account with my broker?\n\nIf you have not received your DRS Statement and you are a certified shareholder or a broker/nominee, please contact us on info@okyopharma.com further assistance. Alternatively, you can contact Worldwide Stock Transfer directly.\n\n##### Who can I contact with questions?\n\nYou, together with your broker, should contact Worldwide Stock Transfer with any questions on transferring your shares. You can contact Worldwide Stock Transfer by:\n\nCalling: +1 (201) 820-2008 \n\nEmailing:ykopstick@wwstr.com\n\nor\n\nWriting to: Worldwide Stock Transfer, LLC, One University Plaza, Suite 505, Hackensack, NJ 07601USA.\n\nWebsite:[www.worldwidestocktransfer.com](http://www.worldwidestocktransfer.com/)\n\nThe telephone line for general shareholder inquiries is: +1 (201) 820-2008\n"
