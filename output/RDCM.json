(Nasdaq: RDCM)** announced today that a North American operator has selected RADCOM to provide its leading Radio Access Network (RAN) Analysis solution. This multi-year, low seven-figure contract aims to proactively ensure optimal user experiences across the operator’s 5G RAN network.\n\nRADCOM’s RAN Analysis capabilities have been significantly bolstered by incorporating Continual’s mobile experience analytics, which RADCOM acquired in May 2023. This integration enhances RADCOM’s cloud-focused assurance and intelligent analytics portfolio, especially within the radio network domain.\n\n“We are thrilled to collaborate with this operator as they expand their advanced 5G voice services, utilizing cutting-edge technologies,” said Hilik Itman, RADCOM’s Interim Chief Executive Officer. “Our sophisticated RAN analysis empowers hundreds of engineers to deliver a superior 5G voice experience by providing precise, real-time insights into their RAN network’s performance, 24/7. By integrating our RAN analytics with the operator’s service management system, their teams can prioritize and resolve issues more efficiently, significantly reducing workload, cutting costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction.”\n\nThe contract provides the operator with RADCOM’s advanced RAN Analysis to optimize its Voice over New Radio (VoNR) or 5G voice services on its public cloud network. This provides crucial data insights, enabling engineers to resolve radio issues swiftly and ensure top-quality VoNR services. The enhanced capabilities allow the operator to conduct on-demand RAN analysis by correlating radio, core, and geolocation data, delivering highly accurate, real-time insights into VoNR performance at the subscriber level.\n\nService degradations often occur within the RAN, creating challenges for engineers tasked with identifying and prioritizing customer-affecting issues when utilizing alternative RAN monitoring solutions. RADCOM RAN Analysis overcomes these hurdles by correlating radio performance with core data in real time to pinpoint the problems that impact the user experience and accurately reflect subscribers’ experiences. It also provides geolocation data, allowing teams to prioritize their efforts and precisely target areas where quality is low.\n\nRADCOM RAN Analysis also empowers network engineers with data insights to optimize new radio sites throughout the roll-out process—before, during, and after deployment—ensuring a proactive, seamless end-to-end user experience. This approach significantly reduces the need for physical drive tests, lowering CO2 emissions.
