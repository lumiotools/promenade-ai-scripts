The revenue decrease was primarily driven by lower demand for research and discovery products.\n  * Biologics Safety Testing revenue was $15.3 million for the third quarter, representing a 2.5% decrease year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand in the bioprocessing market.\n\n\n\nNet loss and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) were $(176.0) million and $12.7 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net loss and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $(15.1) million and $11.9 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024****Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $202.8 million, representing a 5.6% decrease over the same period in the prior year and was driven by the following:\n\n  * Nucleic Acid Production revenue was $154.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 6.9% decrease year-over-year. The revenue decrease was primarily driven by lower demand for research and discovery products.\n  * Biologics Safety Testing revenue was $48.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 1.1% decrease year-over-year.\n\n\n\nNet loss and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) were $(213.1) million and $37.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $(28.4) million and $44.8 million, respectively, for the same period in the prior year.\n\n**Financial Guidance for****2024**\n\nMaravai’s financial guidance for the full year 2024 is based on expectations for its existing business and does not include the financial impact of potential new acquisitions, including the planned acquisition of the DNA and RNA business of Officinae Bio, or items that have not yet been identified or quantified. This guidance is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those identified in “Forward-looking Statements” below.\n\nRevenue expectations for 2024 are now expected to be in the range of $255.0 million to $265.0 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) margins are now expected to be in the range of 16% to 18%.\n\nAs it relates to forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, Maravai cannot provide guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure or a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure because it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate

acquisitions.  \n---|---  \n(2)  | Refers to incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate completed acquisitions, including retention payments related to integration that were negotiated specifically at the time of the Company’s acquisition of MyChem, LLC (“MyChem”) and Alphazyme, LLC (“Alphazyme”), which were completed in January 2022 and January 2023, respectively. These retention payments arise from the Company’s agreements executed in connection with the acquisitions of MyChem and Alphazyme and provide incremental financial incentives, over and above recurring compensation, to ensure the employees of these companies remain present and participate in integration of the acquired businesses during the integration and knowledge transfer periods. The Company agreed to pay certain employees of Alphazyme retention payments totaling $9.3 million as of various dates but primarily through December 31, 2025, as long as these individuals continue to be employed by the Company. The Company agreed to pay the sellers of MyChem retention payments totaling $20.0 million as of the second anniversary of the closing of the acquisition date as long as two senior employees (who were also the sellers of MyChem) continue to be employed by TriLink. The Company considers the payment of these retention payments as probable and is recognizing compensation expense related to these payments in the post-acquisition period ratably over the service period. Retention payment expenses were $0.8 million (Alphazyme $0.8 million) and $4.3 million (MyChem $1.8 million; Alphazyme $2.5 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Retention payment expenses were $3.1 million (MyChem $2.4 million; Alphazyme $0.7 million) and $8.6 million (MyChem $6.8 million; Alphazyme $1.8 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Retention expenses for MyChem concluded in the first quarter of 2024, and following the payments in the first quarter of 2024, there are no further retention expenses payable for MyChem. The remaining retention accrual for Alphazyme is $4.2 million, expected to be accrued ratably each quarter through December 31, 2025, with payments expected to be made in the first quarter of 2026. There are no further cash-based retention payments planned, other than those disclosed above, for acquisitions completed as of September 30, 2024.  \n(3) | Refers to non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation.  \n(4) | Refers to diligence, legal, accounting, tax and consulting fees incurred associated with acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated.  \n(5) | Refers to transaction costs related to the refinancing of our long-term debt that are not capitalizable.  \n(6) | Refers to non-cash (income) expense associated with adjustments to the indemnification asset recorded in connection with the acquisition of MyChem.  \n(7) | Refers to the adjustment of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability primarily due to changes in Maravai’s estimated state apportionment and the corresponding change of its estimated state tax rate.  \n(8) | Refers to goodwill impairment recorded for our Nucleic Acid Production segment.  \n(9) | Refers to restructuring costs (benefit) associated with the Cost Realignment Plan, which was implemented in November 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation benefit of $1.2 million related to forfeited stock awards in connection with the restructuring is included in the stock-based compensation line item. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, such amount was immaterial.  \n(10) | For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, refers to loss on abandoned projects, severance payments, inventory step-up charges and certain other adjustments in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, and other non-recurring costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, refers to severance payments, legal settlement amounts, inventory step-up charges in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, certain working capital and other adjustments related to the acquisition of MyChem, and other non-recurring costs.  \n(11) | Represents additional corporate income taxes at an assumed effective tax rate of approximately 24% applied to additional net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. from the assumed proforma exchange of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.  \n(12) | Represents income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments at an assumed effective tax rate of approximately 24% and the assumed proforma exchange of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.  \n(13)  | Represents income tax benefits due to the amortization of intangible assets and other tax attributes resulting from the tax basis step up associated with the purchase or exchange of Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC units and Class B common stock, net of payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted fully diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS).\n\nMaravai defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and adjustments to exclude, as applicable: (i) fair value adjustments to acquisition contingent consideration; (ii) incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate completed acquisitions, and associated retention payments; (iii) non-cash expenses related to share-based compensation; (iv) expenses incurred for acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated (including legal, accounting and professional consulting services); (v) transaction costs incurred for debt refinancings; (vi) non-cash expense associated with adjustments to the carrying value of the indemnification asset recorded in connection with completed acquisitions; (vii) loss (income) recognized during the applicable period due to changes in the tax receivable agreement liability; (viii) impairment charges; (ix) restructuring costs; (x) loss on abandoned projects; (xi) severance payments; (xii) legal settlement amounts; and (xii) inventory step-up charges in connection with completed acquisitions. Maravai defines Adjusted Net (Loss) Income as tax-effected earnings before the adjustments described above, and the tax effects of those adjustments. Maravai defines Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net (Loss) Income divided by the diluted weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding for the applicable period, which assumes the proforma exchange of all outstanding units of Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC (paired with shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are supplemental measures of operating performance that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net (loss) income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures to understand and evaluate Maravai’s core operating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. Management believes the measures facilitate comparison of Maravai’s operating performance on a consistent basis between periods and, when viewed in combination with its results prepared in accordance with GAAP, help provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting Maravai’s results of operations.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of Maravai’s results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, they should not be considered as a replacement for net (loss) income, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of Maravai’s profitability. Management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on Maravai’s GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nMaravai’s management will host a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. PT/ 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Approximately 10 minutes before the call, dial (888) 596-4144 or (646) 968-2525 and reference Maravai LifeSciences, Conference ID 9502421. The call will also be available via live or archived webcast on the \"Investors\" section of the Maravai web site at https://investors.maravai.com/.\n\n**About Maravai**\n\nMaravai is a leading life sciences company providing critical products to enable the development of drug therapies, diagnostics and novel vaccines and to support research on human diseases.

Investors are cautioned that statements in this press release which are not strictly historical statements constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding Maravai’s financial guidance for 2024; Maravai’s effect on the acceleration of transformational research in RNA therapeutics and discovery; growth opportunities, including both organic and inorganic growth; Maravai’s plans to acquire the DNA and RNA business of Officinae Bio and the expected benefits thereof; and future innovations, constitute forward-looking statements and are identified by words like “believe,” “expect,” “see,” “project,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” “anticipate,” or “could” and similar expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on management’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of Maravai’s business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of management’s control. Maravai’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause Maravai’s actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n\n  * The level of Maravai’s customers’ spending on and demand for outsourced nucleic acid production and biologics safety testing products and services.\n  * The impact of ongoing macroeconomic challenges and changes in economic conditions, including adverse developments affecting banks and financial institutions, follow-on effects of those events and related systemic pressures, on Maravai and Maravai’s customers’ current and future business operations.\n  * The effects of Maravai’s recent reduction in force, including on Maravai’s ability to attract and/or retain qualified key personnel.\n  * Use of Maravai’s products by customers in the production of vaccines and therapies, some of which represent relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment, and the impact of unforeseen adverse events, negative clinical outcomes, development of alternative therapies, or increased regulatory scrutiny of these modes of treatment and their financial cost on Maravai’s customers’ use of its products and services.\n  * Competition with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are substantially larger than Maravai and potentially capable of developing new approaches that could make Maravai’s products, services and technology obsolete.\n  * The potential failure of Maravai’s products and services to not perform as expected and the reliability of the technology on which Maravai’s products and services are based.\n  * The risk that Maravai’s products do not comply with required quality standards.\n  * Market acceptance of Maravai’s life science reagents.\n  * Significant fluctuations and unpredictability in Maravai’s quarterly and annual operating results, which make Maravai’s future operating results difficult to predict and could cause Maravai’s operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance Maravai may provide.\n  * Maravai’s ability to implement its strategic plan successfully.\n  * Natural disasters, geopolitical instability (including the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip) and other catastrophic events.\n  * Risks related to Maravai’s acquisitions, including whether Maravai achieves the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies.\n  * Product liability lawsuits.\n  * Maravai’s dependency on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of its revenue and Maravai’s ability to maintain its current relationships with such customers.\n  * Maravai’s reliance on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of Maravai’s raw materials and the risk that Maravai may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers.\n  * The risk that Maravai’s products become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in the future.\n  * Maravai’s ability to obtain, maintain and enforce sufficient intellectual property protection for Maravai’s current or future products.\n  * The risk that a future cyber-attack or security breach cannot be prevented.\n  * Maravai’s ability to protect the confidentiality of Maravai’s proprietary information.\n  * The risk that one of Maravai’s products may be alleged (or found) to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n  * Compliance with Maravai’s obligations under intellectual property license agreements.\n  * Maravai’s or Maravai’s licensors’ failure to maintain the patents or patent applications in-licensed from a third party.\n  * Maravai’s ability to adequately protect Maravai’s intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\n  * Maravai’s existing level of indebtedness and Maravai’s ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\n  * Maravai’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of Maravai’s indebtedness.\n  * Maravai’s potential failure to meet Maravai’s debt service obligations.\n  * Restrictions on Maravai’s current and future operations under the terms applicable to Maravai’s Credit Agreement.\n  * Maravai’s dependence, by virtue of Maravai’s principal asset being its interest in Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC (“Topco LLC”), on distributions from Topco LLC to pay Maravai’s taxes and expenses, including payments under a tax receivable agreement with the former owners of Topco LLC (the “Tax Receivable Agreement” or “TRA”) together with various limitations and restrictions that impact Topco LLC’s ability to make such distributions.\n  * The risk that conflicts of interest could arise between Maravai’s shareholders and Maravai Life Sciences Holdings, LLC (“MLSH 1”), the only other member of Topco LLC, and impede business decisions that could benefit Maravai’s shareholders.\n  * The substantial future cash payments Maravai may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement to MLSH 1 and Maravai Life Sciences Holdings 2, LLC (“MLSH 2”), an entity through which certain of Maravai’s former owners hold their interests in the Company and the negative effect of such payments.\n  * The fact that Maravai’s organizational structure, including the TRA, confers certain benefits upon MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 that will not benefit Maravai’s other common shareholders to the same extent as they will benefit MLSH 1 and MLSH 2.\n  * Maravai’s ability to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the tax attributes covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n  * The possibility that Maravai will receive distributions from Topco LLC significantly in excess of Maravai’s tax liabilities and obligations to make to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n  * Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of Maravai’s income or other tax returns.\n  * Risks related to Maravai’s annual assessment of the effectiveness of Maravai’s internal control over financial reporting, including the potential existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency.\n  * The fact that investment entities affiliated with GTCR, LLC (“GTCR”) currently control a majority of the voting power of Maravai’s outstanding common stock, and it may have interests that conflict with Maravai’s or yours in the future.\n  * Risks related to Maravai’s “controlled company” status within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ.\n  * The potential anti-takeover effects of certain provisions in Maravai’s corporate organizational documents.\n  * Potential sales of a significant portion of Maravai’s outstanding shares of Class A common stock.\n  * Potential preferred stock issuances and the anti-takeover impacts of any such issuances.\n  * Such other factors as discussed throughout the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Maravai’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other documents Maravai files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n\n\nAny forward-looking statements made in this release are based only on information currently available to management and speak only as of the date on which it is made. Maravai undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n```\nContact Information: Deb Hart Maravai LifeSciences + 1 858-988-5917 ir@maravai.com \n```\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ea9d2fb8-12c5-45f9-b357-d0e6258066f2/small/maravai-logo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ea9d2fb8-12c5-45f9-b357-d0e6258066f2)\n\nSource: Maravai LifeSciences Holdings LLC \n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Company Profile](/company-information)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://investors.maravai.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-lookingstatements include, among others, the following: The level of our customers’ spending on and demand for outsourced nucleic acid production and\nbiologics safety testing products and services; uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of our revenue associated with COVID-19-related products and services and the dependency of such revenue, in important respects, on factors outside our control; the impact of ongoing macroeconomic challenges\nand changes in economic conditions, including adverse developments affecting banks and financial institutions, follow-on effectsof those events and related systemic pressures, on our and our customers’ current and future business operations; the effectsof our recent reduction in force, including on our\nability to attract and/or retain qualified key personnel; use of our products by customers in the production of vaccines and therapies, some of which represent relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment, and the impact of unforeseen adverse events, negative clinical outcomes, development of\nalternative therapies, or increased regulatory scrutiny of these modes of treatment and their financial cost on our customers’ use of our products and services; competition with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are substantiallylarger than us and potentially capable of\ndeveloping new approaches that could make our products, services and technology obsolete; the potential failure of our products and services to not perform as expected and the reliability of the technology on which our products and services are based; the risk that our products do not comply with\nrequired quality standards; market acceptance of our life science reagents; significant fluctuations and unpredictability in ourquarterly and annual operating results, which make our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance\nwe may provide; natural disasters, geopolitical instability (including the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the GazaStrip and other catastrophic events; risks related to our acquisitions, including whether we achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies; our dependency\non a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue and our ability to maintain our current relationships withsuch customers; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of our raw materials and the risk that we may not be able to find\nreplacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers; our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce sufficient intellectual property protection for our current or future products; our existing level of indebtedness and our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms; our ability to generate\nsufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness; our potential failure to meet our debt service obligations; and suchother factors as discussed throughout the “Risk Factors” section of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as other documents we file with the Securities and\nExchangeCommission. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whetherwritten or oral, that may\nbe made from time to time, whetheras a result ofnew information, future developments or otherwise.\nThis presentation presents certain “non-GAAP Measures” as defined by the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as a supplement to results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(“GAAP”). These non-GAAP Measures, as well as\nother statistical measures, including Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein), Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, AdjustedEPS (as defined herein), and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (as defined herein) are presented because the Company’s management believes these measures provide additional\ninformation regarding the Company’s performance and because we believe they are useful to investors in evaluating operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. In addition, management believes that these measures are useful to assess the Company’s operating\nperformance trends because they exclude certain material non-cash items, unusual or non-recurring items that are not expected tocontinue in the future, and certain other items. The non-GAAP Measures are not presented in accordance with GAAP, and the Company’s computation of these non-GAAP\nMeasures may vary from those used by other companies. These measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not beconsidered in isolation or as a substitute or alternative to net income or loss, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other\nmeasures of operating performance, liquidity or indebtedness derived in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of historical non-GAAP Measures to historical GAAP measures and additional information on the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures is provided on pages 24-26.\nPast performance may not be a reliable indicator of future results.\nThis presentation also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by the Company relating to market size and growth and other data about the Company’s industry. This data involves a number ofassumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue\nweight to such estimates. Neither the Company nor any other person makes any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such data or undertakes any obligation to update such data after the date of this presentation. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future\nperformance and the future performance of the markets in which the Company operates are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk.\nThe trademarks included herein are the property of the owners thereof and are used for reference purposes only.

These retention payments arise from the Company’s agreements executed in connection with the acquisitions\nof MyChem and Alphazyme and provide incremental financial incentives, over and above recurring compensation, to ensure the employees of these companies remain present and participate in integration of the acquired\nbusinesses during the integration and knowledge transfer periods. The Company agreed to pay certain employees of Alphazyme retention payments totaling $9.3 million as of various dates but primarily through December 31, 2025,\nas long as these individuals continue to be employed by the Company. The Company agreed to pay the sellers of MyChem retention payments totaling $20.0 million as of the second anniversary of the closing of the acquisition date\nas long as two senior employees (who were also the sellers of MyChem) continue to be employed by TriLink. The Company considers the payment of these retention payments as probable and is recognizing compensation expense\nrelated to these payments in the post-acquisition period ratably over the service period. Retention payment expenses were $0.8 million (Alphazyme $0.8 million) and $4.3 million (MyChem $1.8 million; Alphazyme $2.5 million) for\nthe three and nine months ended September30, 2024, respectively. Retention payment expenses were $3.1 million (MyChem $2.4 million; Alphazyme $0.7 million) and $8.6 million (MyChem $6.8 million; Alphazyme $1.8 million)\nfor the three and nine months ended September30, 2023, respectively. Retention expenses for MyChem concluded in the first quarter of 2024, and following the payments in the first quarter of 2024, there are no further retention\nexpenses payable for MyChem. The remaining retention accrual for Alphazyme is $4.2 million, expected to be accrued ratably each quarter through December 31, 2025, with payments expected to be made in the first quarter of\n2026. There are no further cash-based retention payments planned, other than those disclosed above, for acquisitions completed as of September30, 2024.\n(3) Refers to non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation.\n(4) Refers to diligence, legal, accounting, tax and consulting fees incurred associated with acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated.\n(5) Refers to transaction costs related to the refinancing of our long-term debt that are not capitalizable.\n(6) Refers to non-cash (income) expense associated with adjustments to the indemnification asset recorded in connection with the acquisition of MyChem, LLC (“MyChem”), which was completed in January 2022.\n(7) Refers to the adjustment of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability primarily due to changes in Maravai’s estimated state apportionment and the corresponding change of its estimated state tax rate.\n(8) Refers to goodwill impairment recorded for our Nucleic Acid Production segment.\n(9) Refers to restructuring costs (benefit) associated with the Cost Realignment Plan, which was implemented in November 2023. For the nine months ended September30, 2024, stock-based compensation benefit of $1.2 million\nrelated to forfeited stock awards in connection with the restructuring is included in the stock-based compensation line item. For the three months ended September30, 2024, such amount was immaterial.\n(10) For the three and nine months ended September30, 2024, refers to loss on abandoned projects, severance payments, inventory step-up charges and certain other adjustments in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, LLC\n(“Alphazyme”), which was completed in January 2023, and other non-recurring costs. For the three and nine months ended September30, 2023, refers to severance payments, legal settlement amounts, inventory step-up charges in\nconnection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, certain working capital and other adjustments related to the acquisition of MyChem, and other non-recurring costs.\n(11) Represents additional corporate income taxes at an assumed effective tax rate of approximately 24% applied to additional net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. from the assumed proforma exchange of all\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.\n(12) Represents income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments at an assumed effective tax rate of approximately 24% and the assumed proforma exchange of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common\nstock.\n(13) Represents income tax benefits due to the amortization of intangible assets and other tax attributes resulting from the tax basis step up associated with the purchase or exchange of Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC units and Class B\ncommon stock, net of payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n26 ©2024 Maravai LifeSciences."

The revenue decrease was primarily driven by lower demand for research and discovery products.\n  * Biologics Safety Testing revenue was $15.3 million for the third quarter, representing a 2.5% decrease year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand in the bioprocessing market.\n\n\n\nNet loss and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) were $(176.0) million and $12.7 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net loss and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $(15.1) million and $11.9 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024****Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $202.8 million, representing a 5.6% decrease over the same period in the prior year and was driven by the following:\n\n  * Nucleic Acid Production revenue was $154.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 6.9% decrease year-over-year. The revenue decrease was primarily driven by lower demand for research and discovery products.\n  * Biologics Safety Testing revenue was $48.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing a 1.1% decrease year-over-year.\n\n\n\nNet loss and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) were $(213.1) million and $37.5 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net loss and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $(28.4) million and $44.8 million, respectively, for the same period in the prior year.\n\n**Financial Guidance for****2024**\n\nMaravai’s financial guidance for the full year 2024 is based on expectations for its existing business and does not include the financial impact of potential new acquisitions, including the planned acquisition of the DNA and RNA business of Officinae Bio, or items that have not yet been identified or quantified. This guidance is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those identified in “Forward-looking Statements” below.\n\nRevenue expectations for 2024 are now expected to be in the range of $255.0 million to $265.0 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) margins are now expected to be in the range of 16% to 18%.\n\nAs it relates to forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, Maravai cannot provide guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure or a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure because it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of certain significant reconciling items without unreasonable effort.\n\n**MARAVAI LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS**  \n(in

acquisitions.  \n---|---  \n(2)  | Refers to incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate completed acquisitions, including retention payments related to integration that were negotiated specifically at the time of the Company’s acquisition of MyChem, LLC (“MyChem”) and Alphazyme, LLC (“Alphazyme”), which were completed in January 2022 and January 2023, respectively. These retention payments arise from the Company’s agreements executed in connection with the acquisitions of MyChem and Alphazyme and provide incremental financial incentives, over and above recurring compensation, to ensure the employees of these companies remain present and participate in integration of the acquired businesses during the integration and knowledge transfer periods. The Company agreed to pay certain employees of Alphazyme retention payments totaling $9.3 million as of various dates but primarily through December 31, 2025, as long as these individuals continue to be employed by the Company. The Company agreed to pay the sellers of MyChem retention payments totaling $20.0 million as of the second anniversary of the closing of the acquisition date as long as two senior employees (who were also the sellers of MyChem) continue to be employed by TriLink. The Company considers the payment of these retention payments as probable and is recognizing compensation expense related to these payments in the post-acquisition period ratably over the service period. Retention payment expenses were $0.8 million (Alphazyme $0.8 million) and $4.3 million (MyChem $1.8 million; Alphazyme $2.5 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Retention payment expenses were $3.1 million (MyChem $2.4 million; Alphazyme $0.7 million) and $8.6 million (MyChem $6.8 million; Alphazyme $1.8 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Retention expenses for MyChem concluded in the first quarter of 2024, and following the payments in the first quarter of 2024, there are no further retention expenses payable for MyChem. The remaining retention accrual for Alphazyme is $4.2 million, expected to be accrued ratably each quarter through December 31, 2025, with payments expected to be made in the first quarter of 2026. There are no further cash-based retention payments planned, other than those disclosed above, for acquisitions completed as of September 30, 2024.  \n(3) | Refers to non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation.  \n(4) | Refers to diligence, legal, accounting, tax and consulting fees incurred associated with acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated.  \n(5) | Refers to transaction costs related to the refinancing of our long-term debt that are not capitalizable.  \n(6) | Refers to non-cash (income) expense associated with adjustments to the indemnification asset recorded in connection with the acquisition of MyChem.  \n(7) | Refers to the adjustment of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability primarily due to changes in Maravai’s estimated state apportionment and the corresponding change of its estimated state tax rate.  \n(8) | Refers to goodwill impairment recorded for our Nucleic Acid Production segment.  \n(9) | Refers to restructuring costs (benefit) associated with the Cost Realignment Plan, which was implemented in November 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation benefit of $1.2 million related to forfeited stock awards in connection with the restructuring is included in the stock-based compensation line item. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, such amount was immaterial.  \n(10) | For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, refers to loss on abandoned projects, severance payments, inventory step-up charges and certain other adjustments in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, and other non-recurring costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, refers to severance payments, legal settlement amounts, inventory step-up charges in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, certain working capital and other adjustments related to the acquisition of MyChem, and other non-recurring costs.  \n(11) | Represents additional corporate income taxes at an assumed effective tax rate of approximately 24% applied to additional net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. from the assumed proforma exchange of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.  \n(12) | Represents income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments at an assumed effective tax rate of approximately 24% and the assumed proforma exchange of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.  \n(13)  | Represents income tax benefits due to the amortization of intangible assets and other tax attributes resulting from the tax basis step up associated with the purchase or exchange of Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC units and Class B common stock, net of payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted fully diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS).\n\nMaravai defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and adjustments to exclude, as applicable: (i) fair value adjustments to acquisition contingent consideration; (ii) incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate completed acquisitions, and associated retention payments; (iii) non-cash expenses related to share-based compensation; (iv) expenses incurred for acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated (including legal, accounting and professional consulting services); (v) transaction costs incurred for debt refinancings; (vi) non-cash expense associated with adjustments to the carrying value of the indemnification asset recorded in connection with completed acquisitions; (vii) loss (income) recognized during the applicable period due to changes in the tax receivable agreement liability; (viii) impairment charges; (ix) restructuring costs; (x) loss on abandoned projects; (xi) severance payments; (xii) legal settlement amounts; and (xii) inventory step-up charges in connection with completed acquisitions. Maravai defines Adjusted Net (Loss) Income as tax-effected earnings before the adjustments described above, and the tax effects of those adjustments. Maravai defines Adjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net (Loss) Income divided by the diluted weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding for the applicable period, which assumes the proforma exchange of all outstanding units of Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC (paired with shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are supplemental measures of operating performance that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net (loss) income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures to understand and evaluate Maravai’s core operating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. Management believes the measures facilitate comparison of Maravai’s operating performance on a consistent basis between periods and, when viewed in combination with its results prepared in accordance with GAAP, help provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting Maravai’s results of operations.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of Maravai’s results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, they should not be considered as a replacement for net (loss) income, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of Maravai’s profitability. Management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on Maravai’s GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nMaravai’s management will host a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. PT/ 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.

Investors are cautioned that statements in this press release which are not strictly historical statements constitute forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding Maravai’s financial guidance for 2024; Maravai’s effect on the acceleration of transformational research in RNA therapeutics and discovery; growth opportunities, including both organic and inorganic growth; Maravai’s plans to acquire the DNA and RNA business of Officinae Bio and the expected benefits thereof; and future innovations, constitute forward-looking statements and are identified by words like “believe,” “expect,” “see,” “project,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seek,” “anticipate,” or “could” and similar expressions.\n\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on management’s current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of Maravai’s business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of management’s control. Maravai’s actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause Maravai’s actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n\n  * The level of Maravai’s customers’ spending on and demand for outsourced nucleic acid production and biologics safety testing products and services.\n  * The impact of ongoing macroeconomic challenges and changes in economic conditions, including adverse developments affecting banks and financial institutions, follow-on effects of those events and related systemic pressures, on Maravai and Maravai’s customers’ current and future business operations.\n  * The effects of Maravai’s recent reduction in force, including on Maravai’s ability to attract and/or retain qualified key personnel.\n  * Use of Maravai’s products by customers in the production of vaccines and therapies, some of which represent relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment, and the impact of unforeseen adverse events, negative clinical outcomes, development of alternative therapies, or increased regulatory scrutiny of these modes of treatment and their financial cost on Maravai’s customers’ use of its products and services.\n  * Competition with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are substantially larger than Maravai and potentially capable of developing new approaches that could make Maravai’s products, services and technology obsolete.\n  * The potential failure of Maravai’s products and services to not perform as expected and the reliability of the technology on which Maravai’s products and services are based.\n  * The risk that Maravai’s products do not comply with required quality standards.\n  * Market acceptance of Maravai’s life science reagents.\n  * Significant fluctuations and unpredictability in Maravai’s quarterly and annual operating results, which make Maravai’s future operating results difficult to predict and could cause Maravai’s operating results to fall below expectations or any guidance Maravai may provide.\n  * Maravai’s ability to implement its strategic plan successfully.\n  * Natural disasters, geopolitical instability (including the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip) and other catastrophic events.\n  * Risks related to Maravai’s acquisitions, including whether Maravai achieves the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies.\n  * Product liability lawsuits.\n  * Maravai’s dependency on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of its revenue and Maravai’s ability to maintain its current relationships with such customers.\n  * Maravai’s reliance on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of Maravai’s raw materials and the risk that Maravai may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers.\n  * The risk that Maravai’s products become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in the future.\n  * Maravai’s ability to obtain, maintain and enforce sufficient intellectual property protection for Maravai’s current or future products.\n  * The risk that a future cyber-attack or security breach cannot be prevented.\n  * Maravai’s ability to protect the confidentiality of Maravai’s proprietary information.\n  * The risk that one of Maravai’s products may be alleged (or found) to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n  * Compliance with Maravai’s obligations under intellectual property license agreements.\n  * Maravai’s or Maravai’s licensors’ failure to maintain the patents or patent applications in-licensed from a third party.\n  * Maravai’s ability to adequately protect Maravai’s intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\n  * Maravai’s existing level of indebtedness and Maravai’s ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\n  * Maravai’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of Maravai’s indebtedness.\n  * Maravai’s potential failure to meet Maravai’s debt service obligations.\n  * Restrictions on Maravai’s current and future operations under the terms applicable to Maravai’s Credit Agreement.\n  * Maravai’s dependence, by virtue of Maravai’s principal asset being its interest in Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC (“Topco LLC”), on distributions from Topco LLC to pay Maravai’s taxes and expenses, including payments under a tax receivable agreement with the former owners of Topco LLC (the “Tax Receivable Agreement” or “TRA”) together with various limitations and restrictions that impact Topco LLC’s ability to make such distributions.\n  * The risk that conflicts of interest could arise between Maravai’s shareholders and Maravai Life Sciences Holdings, LLC (“MLSH 1”), the only other member of Topco LLC, and impede business decisions that could benefit Maravai’s shareholders.\n  * The substantial future cash payments Maravai may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement to MLSH 1 and Maravai Life Sciences Holdings 2, LLC (“MLSH 2”), an entity through which certain of Maravai’s former owners hold their interests in the Company and the negative effect of such payments.\n  * The fact that Maravai’s organizational structure, including the TRA, confers certain benefits upon MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 that will not benefit Maravai’s other common shareholders to the same extent as they will benefit MLSH 1 and MLSH 2.\n  * Maravai’s ability to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the tax attributes covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n  * The possibility that Maravai will receive distributions from Topco LLC significantly in excess of Maravai’s tax liabilities and obligations to make to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n  * Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of Maravai’s income or other tax returns.\n  * Risks related to Maravai’s annual assessment of the effectiveness of Maravai’s internal control over financial reporting, including the potential existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency.\n  * The fact that investment entities affiliated with GTCR, LLC (“GTCR”) currently control a majority of the voting power of Maravai’s outstanding common stock, and it may have interests that conflict with Maravai’s or yours in the future.\n  * Risks related to Maravai’s “controlled company” status within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ.\n  * The potential anti-takeover effects of certain provisions in Maravai’s corporate organizational documents.\n  * Potential sales of a significant portion of Maravai’s outstanding shares of Class A common stock.\n  * Potential preferred stock issuances and the anti-takeover impacts of any such issuances.\n  * Such other factors as discussed throughout the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Maravai’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as other documents Maravai files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\n\n\nAny forward-looking statements made in this release are based only on information currently available to management and speak only as of the date on which it is made. Maravai undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\n```\nContact Information: Deb Hart Maravai LifeSciences + 1 858-988-5917 ir@maravai.com \n```\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ea9d2fb8-12c5-45f9-b357-d0e6258066f2/small/maravai-logo-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ea9d2fb8-12c5-45f9-b357-d0e6258066f2)\n\nSource: Maravai LifeSciences Holdings LLC \n\nReleased November 7, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Company Profile](/company-information)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://investors.maravai.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

consideration related to completed acquisitions.\n(2) Refers to incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate completed acquisitions, including retention payments related to integration that were negotiated\nspecifically at the time of the Company’s acquisition of MyChem, LLC (“MyChem”) and Alphazyme, LLC (“Alphazyme”), which were completed in January 2022\nand January 2023, respectively. These retention payments arise from the Company’s agreements executed in connection with the acquisitions of MyChem and\nAlphazyme and provide incremental financial incentives, over and above recurring compensation, to ensure the employees of these companies remain\npresent and participate in integration of the acquired businesses during the integration and knowledge transfer periods. The Company agreed to pay certain\nemployees of Alphazyme retention payments totaling $9.3 million as of various dates but primarily through December 31, 2025, as long as these individuals\ncontinue to be employed by the Company. The Company agreed to pay the sellers of MyChem retention payments totaling $20.0 million as of the second\nanniversary of the closing of the acquisition date as long as two senior employees (who were also the sellers of MyChem) continue to be employed by TriLink.\nThe Company considers the payment of these retention payments as probable and is recognizing compensation expense related to these payments in the\npost-acquisition period ratably over the service period. Retention payment expenses were $0.8 million (Alphazyme $0.8 million) and $4.3 million (MyChem\n$1.8 million; Alphazyme $2.5 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Retention payment expenses were $3.1 million\n(MyChem $2.4 million; Alphazyme $0.7 million) and $8.6 million (MyChem $6.8 million; Alphazyme $1.8 million) for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. Retention expenses for MyChem concluded in the first quarter of 2024, and following the payments in the first quarter of\n2024, there are no further retention expenses payable for MyChem. The remaining retention accrual for Alphazyme is $4.2 million, expected to be accrued\nratably each quarter through December 31, 2025, with payments expected to be made in the first quarter of 2026. There are no further cash-based retention\npayments planned, other than those disclosed above, for acquisitions completed as of September 30, 2024.\n(3) Refers to non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation.\n(4) Refers to diligence, legal, accounting, tax and consulting fees incurred associated with acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated.\n(5) Refers to transaction costs related to the refinancing of our long-term debt that are not capitalizable.\n(6) Refers to non-cash (income) expense associated with adjustments to the indemnification asset recorded in connection with the acquisition of MyChem.\n(7) Refers to the adjustment of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability primarily due to changes in Maravai’s estimated state apportionment and the corresponding\nchange of its estimated state tax rate.\n(8) Refers to goodwill impairment recorded for our Nucleic Acid Production segment.\n(9) Refers to restructuring costs (benefit) associated with the Cost Realignment Plan, which was implemented in November 2023. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, stock-based compensation benefit of $1.2 million related to forfeited stock awards in connection with the restructuring is included in the\nstock-based compensation line item.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrefers to severance payments, legal settlement amounts, inventory step-up charges in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, certain working capital\nand other adjustments related to the acquisition of MyChem, and other non-recurring costs.\n(11) Represents additional corporate income taxes at an assumed effective tax rate of approximately 24% applied to additional net loss attributable to Maravai\nLifeSciences Holdings, Inc. from the assumed proforma exchange of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.\n(12) Represents income tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments at an assumed effective tax rate of approximately 24% and the assumed proforma exchange of all\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.\n(13) Represents income tax benefits due to the amortization of intangible assets and other tax attributes resulting from the tax basis step up associated with the\npurchase or exchange of Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC units and Class B common stock, net of payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-GAAP\nmeasures include: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted fully diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS).\nMaravai defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization and adjustments to exclude, as applicable: (i) fair value adjustments to\nacquisition contingent consideration; (ii) incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate\ncompleted acquisitions, and associated retention payments; (iii) non-cash expenses related\nto share-based compensation; (iv) expenses incurred for acquisitions that were pursued but\nnot consummated (including legal, accounting and professional consulting services); (v)\ntransaction costs incurred for debt refinancings; (vi) non-cash expense associated with\nadjustments to the carrying value of the indemnification asset recorded in connection with\ncompleted acquisitions; (vii) loss (income) recognized during the applicable period due to\nchanges in the tax receivable agreement liability; (viii) impairment charges; (ix) restructuring\ncosts; (x) loss on abandoned projects; (xi) severance payments; (xii) legal settlement\namounts; and (xii) inventory step-up charges in connection with completed acquisitions.\nMaravai defines Adjusted Net (Loss) Income as tax-effected earnings before the\nadjustments described above, and the tax effects of those adjustments. Maravai defines\nAdjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net (Loss) Income divided by the diluted weighted\naverage number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding for the applicable period,\nwhich assumes the proforma exchange of all outstanding units of Maravai Topco Holdings,\nLLC (paired with shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock.\nThese non-GAAP measures are supplemental measures of operating performance that are\nnot prepared in accordance with GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be\nconsidered as, an alternative to net (loss) income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures to understand and evaluate Maravai’s core\noperating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans.\nManagement believes the measures facilitate comparison of Maravai’s operating\nperformance on a consistent basis between periods and, when viewed in combination with\nits results prepared in accordance with GAAP, help provide a broader picture of factors and\ntrends affecting Maravai’s results of operations.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should\nnot consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of Maravai’s results as reported\nunder GAAP. Because of these limitations, they should not be considered as a replacement\nfor net (loss) income, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of Maravai’s profitability.\nManagement compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on Maravai’s GAAP\nresults and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. The non-GAAP\nfinancial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial\ninformation prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call and Webcast\nMaravai’s management will host a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. PT/ 5:00 p.m. ET to\ndiscuss its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.

customers’ use of its products and services.\nCompetition with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are\nsubstantially larger than Maravai and potentially capable of developing new\napproaches that could make Maravai’s products, services and technology obsolete.\nThe potential failure of Maravai’s products and services to not perform as expected\nand the reliability of the technology on which Maravai’s products and services are\nbased.\nThe risk that Maravai’s products do not comply with required quality standards.\nMarket acceptance of Maravai’s life science reagents.\nSignificant fluctuations and unpredictability in Maravai’s quarterly and annual operating\nresults, which make Maravai’s future operating results difficult to predict and could\ncause

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or\noral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nThis presentation presents certain “non-GAAP Measures” as defined by the rules of the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as a supplement to results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP Measures, as well as other\nstatistical measures, including Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein), Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, Adjusted EPS (as defined herein), and Adjusted Free Cash Flow (as defined herein) are presented because the Company’s management believes these measures provide additional information regarding\nthe Company’s performance and because we believe they are useful to investors in evaluating operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. In addition, management believes that these measures are useful to assess the Company’s operating performance trends because they exclude\ncertain material non-cash items, unusual or non-recurring items that are not expected to continue in the future, and certain other items. The non-GAAP Measures are not presented in accordance with GAAP, and the Company’s computation of these non-GAAP Measures may vary from those used by other companies.\nThese measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute or alternative to net income or loss, operating income or loss, cash flows from operating activities, total indebtedness or any other measures of operating performance, liquidity or indebtedness derived in\naccordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of historical non-GAAP Measures to historical GAAP measures and additional information on the Company's use of non-GAAP financial measures is provided on pages 22-24.\nPast performance may not be a reliable indicator of future results.\nThis presentation also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by the Company relating to market size and growth and other data about the Company’s industry. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such\nestimates. Neither the Company nor any other person makes any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of such data or undertakes any obligation to update such data after the date of this presentation. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future\nperformance of the markets in which the Company operates are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk.\nThe trademarks included herein are the property of the owners thereof and are used for reference purposes only.

These retention payments arise from the Company’s agreements executed in connection with the acquisitions\nof MyChem and Alphazyme and provide incremental financial incentives, over and above recurring compensation, to ensure the employees of these companies remain present and participate in integration of the acquired\nbusinesses during the integration and knowledge transfer periods. The Company agreed to pay certain employees of Alphazyme retention payments totaling $9.3 million as of various dates but primarily through December 31, 2025,\nas long as these individuals continue to be employed by the Company.

          "content": "NASDAQ: MRVI\nQ3 2024\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial\nInformation\nNovember 7, 2024\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain “non-GAAP Measures” as defined by the rules of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”). These non-GAAP measures include: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted fully diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS). Maravai defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation\nand amortization and adjustments to exclude, as applicable: (i) fair value adjustments to acquisition contingent consideration; (ii) incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate completed acquisitions, and\nassociated retention payments; (iii) non-cash expenses related to share-based compensation; (iv) expenses incurred for acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated (including legal, accounting and\nprofessional consulting services); (v) non-cash expense associated with adjustments to the carrying value of the indemnificationasset recorded in connection with completed acquisitions; (vi) loss or (income)\nrecognized during the applicable period due to changes in the tax receivable agreement liability; (vii) restructuring costs; (viii) severance payments; (ix) legal settlement amounts; and (x) inventory step-up charges in\nconnection with completed acquisitions. Maravai defines Adjusted Net (Loss) Income as tax-effected earnings before the adjustments described above, and the tax effects of those adjustments. Maravai defines\nAdjusted Diluted EPS as Adjusted Net (Loss) Income divided by the diluted weighted average number of shares of Class A commonstock outstanding for the applicable period, which assumes the proforma exchange of\nall outstanding units of Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC (paired with shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock.\nThese non-GAAP measures are supplemental measures of operating performance that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net\n(loss) income, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures to understand and evaluate Maravai’s core operating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. Management believes the\nmeasures facilitate comparison of Maravai’s operating performance on a consistent basis between periods and, when viewed in combination with its results prepared in accordance with GAAP, helps provide a broader\npicture of factors and trends affecting Maravai’s results of operations.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as asubstitute for analysis of Maravai’s results as reported under GAAP. Because of these\nlimitations, they should not be considered as a replacement for net (loss) income, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of Maravai’s profitability. Management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily\non Maravai’s GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information\nprepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAs it relates to forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA margin, Maravai cannot provide guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure or a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure because it is unable\nto provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of certain significant reconciling items without unreasonable effort.\n2 © 2024 MaravaiLifeSciences\nTable of Contents\nPage\n4 Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\n5 Adjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted Fully Diluted (Loss) EPS\n6 Explanatory Notes to Reconciliations\n7 Adjusted EBITDA by Segment\n8 GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n3 © 2024 Maravai LifeSciences\nNet Loss to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited)\n4 © 2024 Maravai LifeSciences\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income and Adjusted Fully Diluted (Loss) Earnings Per Share\n5 © 2024 Maravai LifeSciences\nExplanatory notes to reconciliations\n(1) Refers to the change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to completed acquisitions.\n(2) Refers to incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate completed acquisitions, including retention payments related to integration that were negotiated specifically at the time of the Company’s acquisition of MyChem, LLC\n(“MyChem”) and Alphazyme, LLC (“Alphazyme”), which were completed in January 2022 and January 2023, respectively.

All statements\nother than statements of historical fact included in this report, including, without limitation, statements under the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations,” are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial\ncondition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to\nhistorical or current facts. These statements often may include words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “may,” “will,” “should,”\n“can have,” “likely” and other words and terms of similar meaning. These statements are based upon management’s current expectations, assumptions and estimates and are not\nguarantees of the timing or nature of our future operating or financial performance or other events. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other\nfactors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including:\n• The level of our customers’ spending on and demand for outsourced nucleic acid production and biologics safety testing products and services.\n• Our dependency on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue and our ability to maintain our current relationships with such customers.\n• Significant fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results, which make our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our\noperating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide.\n• The impact of ongoing macroeconomic challenges and changes in economic conditions, including adverse developments affecting banks and financial institutions,\nfollow-on effects of those events and related systemic pressures, on our and our customers’ current and future business operations.\n• The effects of our recent reduction in force, including on our ability to attract and/or retain qualified key personnel.\n• Use of our products by customers in the production of vaccines and therapies, some of which represent relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment, and the\nimpact of unforeseen adverse events, negative clinical outcomes, development of alternative therapies, or increased regulatory scrutiny of these modes of treatment and\ntheir financial cost on our customers’ use of our products and services.\n• Competition with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are substantially larger than us and potentially capable of developing new approaches\nthat could make our products, services and technology obsolete.\n• The potential failure of our products and services to not perform as expected and the reliability of the technology on which our products and services are based.\n• The risk

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nMaravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”, and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Maravai”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) provides critical products to enable the\ndevelopment of drugs, therapeutics, diagnostics, vaccines and support research on human diseases. Our products address the key phases of biopharmaceutical development and\ninclude complex nucleic acids for diagnostic and therapeutic applications and antibody-based products to detect impurities during the production of biopharmaceutical products.\nThe Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in August 2020 and is headquartered in San Diego, California. We have two principal businesses: Nucleic Acid\nProduction and Biologics Safety Testing. Our Nucleic Acid Production business manufactures and sells products used in the fields of gene therapy, vaccines, nucleoside\nchemistry, oligonucleotide therapy and molecular diagnostics, including reagents used in the chemical synthesis, modification, labelling and purification of deoxyribonucleic\nacid (“DNA”) and ribonucleic acid (“RNA”). Our core Nucleic Acid Production offerings include messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”), long and short oligonucleotides, our\nproprietary CleanCap® capping technology and oligonucleotide building blocks, and custom enzyme development and manufacturing. Our Biologics Safety Testing business\nsells highly specialized analytical products for use in biologic manufacturing process development, including custom product-specific development antibody and assay\ndevelopment services.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Topco LLC, and, through Topco LLC and its subsidiaries, conducts its business. Because we manage and\noperate the business and control the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Topco LLC and also have a substantial financial interest in Topco LLC, we consolidate the\nfinancial results of Topco LLC, and a portion of our net loss is allocated to the non-controlling interests in Topco LLC held by MLSH 1.\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and\naccounts between the businesses comprising the Company have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nUnaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to Form 10-Q of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they\ndo not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include\nall adjustments necessary to fairly state the financial position and the results of our operations and cash flows for interim periods in accordance with GAAP. All such\nadjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be\nexpected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 or for any future period.\nThe condensed consolidated balance sheet presented as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q and do not contain all information that is included in the annual financial\nstatements and notes thereto of the Company. The condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”) filed with the\nSEC.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments the Company makes about the carrying values\nof assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are based on management’s knowledge about current events and expectations\nabout actions the Company may undertake in the future. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and\nrelated\n12\nTable of Contents\nincremental borrowing rate, the payable to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined in Note 11), the realizability of our net deferred tax assets, and\nthe valuation of goodwill and intangible assets. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nA description of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nThere have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of products, and to a much lesser extent, services in the fields of nucleic acid production and biologics safety testing.\nProducts are sold primarily through a direct sales force and through distributors in certain international markets where the Company does not have a direct commercial\npresence.\nRevenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer or distributor in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity\nexpects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Distributors are the principal in all sales transactions with our customers. To determine revenue recognition for its\narrangements with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the\ncontract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity\nsatisfies a performance obligation.\nThe majority of the Company’s contracts include only one performance obligation. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to\nthe customer and is defined as the unit of account for revenue recognition. The Company also recognizes revenue from other contracts that may include a combination of\nproducts and services, the provision of solely services, or from license fee arrangements which may be associated with the delivery of product. Where there is a combination of\nproducts and services, the Company accounts for the promises as individual performance obligations if they are concluded to be distinct. Performance obligations are\nconsidered distinct if they are both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. In determining whether performance obligations meet the criteria for\nbeing distinct, the Company considers a number of factors, such as the degree of interrelation and interdependence between obligations, and whether or not the good or service\nsignificantly modifies or transforms another good or service in the contract. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant\nfinancing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with\ncustomers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from sales to customers through distributors consistently with the policies and practices for direct sales to customers, as described above.\nNucleic Acid Production\nNucleic Acid Production revenue is generated from the manufacture and sale of highly modified, complex nucleic acid products to support the needs of our customers’\nresearch, therapeutic and vaccine programs. The primary offering of products includes CleanCap®, mRNA, specialized oligonucleotides, and enzymes. Contracts\ntypically consist of a single performance obligation. We also sell nucleic acid products for labeling and detecting proteins in cells and tissue samples research. The\nCompany recognizes revenue from these products in the period in which the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control to the customer or distributor.\nRevenue for nucleic acid catalog products is recognized at a single point in time, generally upon shipment to the customer or distributor. Revenue for contracts for\ncertain custom nucleic acid products, with an enforceable right to payment and a reasonable margin for work performed to date, is recognized over time, based on a cost-\nto-cost input method over the manufacturing period. Payments received from customers in advance of manufacturing their products is recorded as deferred revenue until\nthe products are delivered.\nBiologics Safety Testing\nThe Company’s Biologics Safety Testing revenue is associated with the sale of host cell protein, bioprocess impurity detection, viral clearance prediction kits, and\nassociated products. We also enter into contracts that include custom antibody development, assay development, antibody affinity extraction and mass spectrometry\nservices. These products and services enable the detection of impurities that occur in the manufacturing of biologic drugs and other therapeutics including cell and gene\ntherapies. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of kits and products in the period in which the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control to the\ncustomer or distributor.\n13\nTable of Contents\nCustom antibody development contracts consist of a single performance obligation, typically with an enforceable right to payment and a reasonable margin for work\nperformed to date. Revenue is recognized over time based on a cost-to-cost input method over the contract term. Where an enforceable right to payment does not exist,\nrevenue is recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. Assay development service contracts consist of a single performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized at a point in time when a successful antigen test and report is provided to the customer. Affinity extraction, mass spectrometry and other analytical\nservices, which generally occur over a short period of time, consist of a single performance obligation to perform the service and provide a summary report to the\ncustomer. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of the report to the customer.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length of one year or less. The Company had\nno material unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length greater than one year for any period presented.\nThe Company accepts returns only if the products do not meet specifications, and historically, the Company’s volume of product returns has not been significant. Further, no\nwarranties are provided for promised goods and services other than assurance type warranties.\nRevenue for an individual contract is recognized at the related transaction price, which is the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the\nproducts and/or services. The transaction price for product sales is calculated at the contracted product selling price. The transaction price for a contract with multiple\nperformance obligations is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices for products are determined\nbased on the prices charged to customers, which are directly observable. Standalone selling price of services are mostly based on time and materials. Generally, payments from\ncustomers are due when goods and services are transferred. As most contracts contain a single performance obligation, the transaction price is representative of the standalone\nselling price charged to customers. Revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative amount recognized will not occur in\nfuture periods. Variable consideration has not been material to our consolidated financial statements.\nSales taxes\nSales taxes collected by the Company are not included in the transaction price as revenue as they are ultimately remitted to a governmental authority.\nShipping and handling costs\nThe Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products.\nAccordingly, revenue for shipping and handling is recognized at the same time that the related product revenue is recognized.\nContract costs\nThe Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred when the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been\nrecognized is one year or less. These costs are included in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. The costs to fulfill the contracts are determined to be\nimmaterial and are recognized as an expense when incurred.\nContract balances\nContract assets are generated when contractual billing schedules differ from revenue recognition timing and the Company records a contract receivable when it has an\nunconditional right to consideration. There were no contract asset balances as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nContract liabilities include billings in excess of revenue recognized, such as customer deposits and deferred revenue. Customer deposits, which are included in accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities, are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Deferred revenue is recorded when the Company has\nunsatisfied performance obligations. Total contract liabilities were $2.9 million and $5.5 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Contract\nliabilities are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months.\n14\nTable of Contents\nDisaggregation of revenue\nThe following tables summarize the revenue by segment and region for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNucleic Acid Production Biologics Safety Testing Total\nNorth America $ 27,703 $ 6,988 $ 34,691\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa 3,987 3,477 7,464\nAsia Pacific 18,210 4,710 22,920\nLatin and Central America 47 78 125\nTotal revenue $ 49,947 $ 15,253 $ 65,200\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNucleic Acid Production Biologics Safety Testing Total\nNorth America $ 79,417 $ 20,962 $ 100,379\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa 22,325 12,050 34,375\nAsia Pacific 52,536 14,937 67,473\nLatin and Central America 168 384 552\nTotal revenue $ 154,446 $ 48,333 $ 202,779\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNucleic Acid Production Biologics Safety Testing Total\nNorth America $ 27,893 $ 6,622 $ 34,515\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa 3,703 3,919 7,622\nAsia Pacific 19,601 5,022 24,623\nLatin and Central America 31 74 105\nTotal revenue $ 51,228 $ 15,637 $ 66,865\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nNucleic Acid Production Biologics Safety Testing Total\nNorth America $ 88,961 $ 20,392 $ 109,353\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa 21,345 12,418 33,763\nAsia Pacific 55,495 15,820 71,315\nLatin and Central America 143 230 373\nTotal revenue $ 165,944 $ 48,860 $ 214,804\nTotal revenue is attributed to geographic regions based on the bill-to location of the transaction. For all periods presented, the majority of our revenue was recognized at a point\nin time.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss, net assets and comprehensive income or loss of our consolidated subsidiaries that is not allocable to the\nCompany based on our percentage of ownership of such entities.\nIn November 2020, following the completion of a series of organizational transactions (the “Organizational Transactions”), we became the sole managing member of Topco\nLLC. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 56.1% of the outstanding LLC Units of Topco LLC, and MLSH 1 held approximately 43.9% of the outstanding LLC\nUnits of Topco LLC. Therefore, we report non-controlling interests based on the percentage of LLC Units of Topco LLC held by MLSH 1 on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheet as of September 30, 2024. Income or loss attributed to the non-controlling interest in Topco LLC is based on the LLC Units outstanding during the period for\nwhich the income or loss is generated and is presented on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income\n(loss).\n15\nTable of Contents\nMLSH 1 is entitled to exchange its LLC Units of Topco LLC, together with an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock (together referred to as “Paired Interests”),\nfor shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at our election, for cash, from a substantially concurrent public offering or private sale (based on the price of\nour Class A common stock in such public offering or private sale). As such, future exchanges of Paired Interests by MLSH 1 will result in a change in ownership and reduce or\nincrease the amount recorded as non-controlling interests and increase or decrease additional paid-in-capital when Topco LLC has positive or negative net assets, respectively.\nExchange of Topco LLC Units and Block Trade\nIn May 2024, MLSH 1 exchanged 8,409,946 LLC Units of Topco LLC (paired with an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock) for8 ,409,946 shares of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock. Upon receipt by the Company, the shares of our Class B common stock were subsequently cancelled and retired. Following the exchange,\nMLSH 1 and MLSH 2 sold an aggregate of 9,940,974 shares of our Class A common stock in a block trade (“May 2024 Block Trade”).\nThe Company did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A common stock by either MLSH 1 or MLSH 2, but did incur costs associated with the\nMay 2024 Block Trade, which were not significant.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, MLSH 1 did not exchange any Paired Interests.\nPayments pursuant to Topco LLC Operating Agreement\nThe Topco LLC Operating Agreement entered into at the time of the Organizational Transactions includes a provision requiring cash distributions enabling its owners, including\nMLSH 1, to pay their taxes on income passing through from Topco LLC. Cash distributions of $0.6 million and $9.6 million for tax liabilities were made to MLSH 1 during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No such cash distributions were made during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nSegment Information\nThe Company operates in two reportable segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated\nregularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The CODM allocates resources and\nassesses performance based upon discrete financial information at the segment level. All of our long-lived assets are located in the United States.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from customers for product sales and services. The Company’s expected credit losses are developed using an estimated\nloss rate method that considers historical collection experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nThe estimated loss rates are applied to trade receivables with similar risk characteristics such as the length of time the balance has been outstanding, liquidity and financial\nposition of the customer, and the geographic location of the customer. In certain instances, the Company may identify individual accounts receivable assets that do not share\nrisk characteristics with other accounts receivable, in which case the Company records its expected credit losses on an individual asset basis.\nThe allowance for credit losses was approximately $0.8 million and $1.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were $0.7 million of\nwrite-offs of accounts receivable during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Write-offs of accounts receivable were not significant during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Recoveries were not significant during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThere were no recoveries during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and $0.5 million of recoveries during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not\namortized but is reviewed for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to the Company’s reporting units, which are components of its business for which discrete cash flow\ninformation is available one level below its operating segment. The Company conducts a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually and more frequently if changes in facts\nand circumstances indicate that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units may be less than their respective carrying amount. In performing each annual impairment\nassessment and any interim impairment assessment, the Company determines if it should qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is\nless than its carrying amount (the qualitative impairment test). If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is\n16\nTable of Contents\nless than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform the qualitative impairment test, the Company then performs a quantitative impairment test.\nThe quantitative impairment test is performed using a one-step process. The process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of\nthe reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the\nreporting unit is impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess up to the total amount of goodwill included in the reporting unit. During the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test and recognized goodwill impairment of $154.2 million (see Note 3).\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s finite-lived intangible assets represent purchased intangible assets and primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships, patents, and developed\ntechnology. Certain criteria are used in determining whether finite-lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recognized and reported separately. Finite-\nlived intangible assets are initially recognized at fair value, are subject to amortization and are subsequently recorded at amortized cost. The Company’s finite-lived intangible\nassets are amortized using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are intended to be consumed or otherwise used. If that pattern\ncannot be reliably determined, the respective finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are tested for\nimpairment along with other long-lived assets. Amortization related to patents and developed technology is allocated to cost of revenue whereas amortization associated with\ntrade names and customer relationships is allocated to selling, general and administrative expenses.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use lease assets and finite-lived intangible assets, to determine whether current\nevents or circumstances may indicate that such carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such facts or circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted\nfuture cash flows of these assets is compared to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether impairment exists. If the assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the respective assets. For the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment, long-lived assets\nare grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. No\nimpairment loss was recognized by the Company for any long-lived or intangible assets for any period presented in this report.\nIf the Company determines that events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization or depreciation for a specific long-lived asset, its remaining\nestimated useful life will be revised, and the remaining carrying amount of the long-lived asset will be depreciated or amortized prospectively over the revised remaining\nestimated useful life.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. The Company follows accounting guidance that has a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the\nvaluation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. Instruments with readily available actively quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from actively\nquoted prices in an orderly market, will generally have a higher degree of market price transparency and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. The three\nlevels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\nLevel 2—Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace; and\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, which consisted primarily of money market funds, time and demand deposits,\ntrade accounts receivable, net, and trade accounts payable, approximated their carrying amounts due to the short maturities of these instruments. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt approximated its carrying value, excluding the effect of unamortized debt discount, as it is based on\nborrowing rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 inputs).\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company\nmaintains the majority of its cash balances at multiple financial institutions that\n17\nTable of Contents\nmanagement believes are of high-credit-quality and financially stable. Cash is deposited with major financial institutions in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(“FDIC”) insurance limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the cash is held.\nThe Company provides credit, in the normal course of business, to international and domestic distributors as well as certain customers, which are geographically dispersed. The\nCompany attempts to limit its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintaining adequate allowances for potential credit losses.\nThe following table summarizes revenue from each of our customers who individually accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue or accounts receivable for the periods\npresented:\nRevenue Accounts Receivable, net\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNacalai USA, Inc. 22.5 % 22.9 % 19.5 % 18.5 % * 27.3 %\nCureVac N.V. * * * * * 13.0 %\n____________________\n* Less than 10%\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, all of the revenue recorded for Nacalai USA, Inc. was generated by the Nucleic Acid Production segment.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) -\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which improves segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant expenses. ASU 2023-07 requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported\nmeasure of segment profit or loss, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, any additional measures of a segment’s profit\nor loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources, and the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures\nof segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU also requires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic\n280 to be included in interim periods. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 and expects the adoption of this standard will impact its segment\ndisclosures only with no material impact to its financial position or results of operations.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The amendments in this ASU\naddress investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income\ntaxes paid information. The ASU also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective\napplication permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n2. Restructuring\nIn November 2023, the Company implemented a cost realignment plan (the “Cost Realignment Plan”) that included the termination of approximately1 5% of the Company’s\nworkforce, the termination of certain leases, and other actions to reduce expenses, all as part of a plan to optimize business operations and match them to current market\nconditions. The reduction in force was completed on January 5, 2024, following the end of the sixty-day notification period required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining\nNotification Act. The Cost Realignment Plan was substantially completed during the first quarter of 2024, with most of the cash payments having been disbursed prior to the\nend of such quarter, with the remainder expected to be disbursed by the end of the fiscal year 2024. The Company does not expect to incur additional restructuring costs relating\nto the Cost Realignment Plan.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring charges weren ot significant. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring charges primarily\nconsist of the stock-based compensation benefit recognized for the\n18\nTable of Contents\nforfeiture of stock awards upon the termination of certain impacted employees resulting from the Cost Realignment Plan.T he Company’s restructuring charges by segment and\nunallocated corporate costs, which are recorded as restructuring expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, were as follows for the period presented (in\nthousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nSeverance and Other Stock-Based Compensation Professional Fee Reversals\nEmployee Costs (Reversals) Benefit and Other Total\nNucleic Acid Production $ (17) $ (812) $ (20) $ (849)\nCorporate 52 (409) (14) (371)\nTotal $ 35 $ (1,221) $ (34) $ (1,220)\nThe following table summarizes the activity for accrued restructuring costs, which is recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets, for the period presented (in thousands):\nSeverance and Other Stock-Based Compensation Professional Fee Reversals\nEmployee Costs Benefit and Other Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,543 $ — $ 271 $ 2,814\nCharges (benefit) 35 (1,221) (34) (1,220)\nNon-cash benefit — 1,221 — 1,221\nCash payments (2,542) — (237) (2,779)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 36 $ — $ — $ 36\n3. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the Company’s goodwill by segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nNucleic Acid Production (1) Biologics Safety Testing (2) Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 206,101 $ 119,928 $ 326,029\nImpairment (154,239) — (154,239)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 51,862 $ 119,928 $ 171,790\n____________________\n(1) The Nucleic Acid Production segment had accumulated goodwill impairment of $154.2 million as of September 30, 2024. There had been no accumulated goodwill impairment as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n(2) The Biologics Safety Testing segment had no accumulated goodwill impairment as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had four reporting units, three of which are contained in the Nucleic Acid Production segment. During the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded goodwill impairment of $154.2 million related to the TriLink reporting unit, which is contained in the\nNucleic Acid Production segment.\nIn connection with preparing its financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company tested its reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in\nresponse to impairment indicators identified during the Company’s forecasting process. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company revised its long-term\nforecast to reflect lower projected near term revenues due to lower demand in research and discovery products within our Nucleic Acid Production business. This revision also\nconsidered the slower than expected transition to new mRNA clinical trials as customers prioritize existing programs and more conservatively invest in new programs as the\nresults of continued macroeconomic pressures. The Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test on each of its four reporting units.\nThe Company performed the impairment test using a combination of the income and the market approach to determine whether the fair value of each reporting unit was less than\nits carrying value. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model with inputs developed using both internal and market-based data, while the market approach\nutilizes comparable company information. The significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow models vary amongst, and are specific to, each reporting\n19\nTable of Contents\nunit and include, but are not limited to, discount rates, revenue growth rate assumptions (including terminal growth rates) and operating margin percentages. Discount rates were\ndetermined using a weighted average cost of capital specific to each reporting unit and other market and industry data. For TriLink, the selected discount rate was 10.5%. These\nassumptions were developed in light of current market conditions and future expectations which include, but were not limited to, new product and service developments, impact\nof competition and future economic conditions. These estimates and assumptions represent a Level 3 measurement because they are supported by little or no market activity and\nreflect our own assumptions in measuring fair value. Based on its interim quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that the TriLink reporting unit had a carrying value\nthat exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded goodwill impairment of $154.2 million on the condensed consolidated statements of operations, which\nwas the entire goodwill balance at the reporting unit. No impairment was recorded for the Company’s remaining three reporting units, as each of their fair values exceeded their\nrespective carrying values.\nIntangible Assets\nIn conjunction with the goodwill impairment test, the Company also evaluated the recoverability of its long-lived assets (including finite-lived intangible assets). The Company\nperformed the impairment test by comparing the respective carrying value of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated\nfrom such assets. Based on the interim impairment test, it was determined that the carrying value of the assets did not exceed their respective current and expected future cash\nflows, on an undiscounted basis. As a result, no impairment for long-lived assets (including finite-lived intangible assets) was recorded.\nIntangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which reflects the expected pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being obtained, over\nan estimated useful life ranging from 3 to 14 years.\nThe following are components of finite-lived intangible assets and accumulated amortization as of the periods presented (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nWeighted\nAverage\nGross Net Estimated Remaining\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Useful Amortization\nAmount Amortization Amount Life Period\n(in thousands) (in years) (in years)\nTrade Names $ 7,800 $ (6,729) $ 1,071 3 - 10 2.2\nPatents and Developed Technology 321,149 (128,575) 192,574 10- 14 8.3\nCustomer Relationships 22,313 (14,100) 8,213 10 - 12 5.3\nTotal $ 351,262 $ (149,404) $ 201,858 8.1\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted\nAverage\nGross Net Estimated Remaining\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Useful Amortization\nAmount Amortization Amount Life Period\n(in thousands) (in years) (in years)\nTrade Names $ 7,800 $ (6,369) $ 1,431 3 - 10 2.8\nPatents and Developed Technology 319,649 (109,800) 209,849 10- 14 8.9\nCustomer Relationships 22,313 (12,606) 9,707 10 - 12 5.9\nTotal $ 349,762 $ (128,775) $ 220,987 8.7\nThe Company recognized $6.2 million and $18.7 million of amortization expense from intangible assets directly linked with revenue-generating activities within cost of\nrevenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The Company recognized $6.2 million\nand $18.5 million of amortization expense from intangible assets directly linked with revenue-generating activities within cost of revenue in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAmortization expense for intangible assets that are not directly related to revenue-generating activities of $0.7 million and $2.0 million was recorded as selling, general and\nadministrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Amortization expense for intangible assets that are not directly related to\nrevenue-generating activities of $0.7\n20\nTable of Contents\nmillion and $2.0 million was recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the estimated future amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was as follows (in thousands):\n2024 (remaining three months) $ 6,901\n2025 27,460\n2026 27,223\n2027 26,207\n2028 25,987\nThereafter 88,080\nTotal estimated amortization expense $ 201,858\n4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of\nthe periods presented (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements as of September 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nMoney market funds $ 415,689 $ — $ — $ 415,689\nInterest rate cap, current — 3,518 — 3,518\nTotal assets $ 415,689 $ 3,518 $ — $ 419,207\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration, non-current $ — $ — $ 630 $ 630\nFair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nMoney market funds $ 418,685 $ — $ — $ 418,685\nInterest rate cap, non-current — 8,559 — 8,559\nTotal assets $ 418,685 $ 8,559 $ — $ 427,244\nLiabilities\nCurrent portion of contingent consideration $ — $ — $ 131 $ 131\nContingent consideration, non-current — — 1,872 1,872\nTotal liabilities $ — $ — $ 2,003 $ 2,003\nContingent Consideration\nIn connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, LLC (“Alphazyme”), which was completed in January 2023, the Company was initially required to make contingent payments\nto the sellers of Alphazyme of up to $75.0 million (the “Performance Payments”), subject to Alphazyme achieving certain revenue thresholds during each of the fiscal years\n2023 through 2025. The preliminary fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration recognized upon the completion of the acquisition as part of the purchase\naccounting opening balance sheet was $5.3 million. The preliminary fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation-based model\ndiscounted to present value. Assumptions used to determine the fair value were expected revenue, a discount rate of 17.8% and various probability factors. The ultimate\nsettlement of the contingent consideration could deviate from current estimates based on actual revenues. The contingent consideration consists of three Performance Payments\nfor each of the performance periods, with the first payment (to the extent earned) due in 2024. For the first performance period which ended on December 31, 2023, it was\ndetermined that the defined revenue target was not achieved. Consequently, no payment for contingent consideration was made to the sellers of Alphazyme in 2024. As of\n21\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company may be required to make contingent payments to the sellers of Alphazyme of up to $45.0 million for the remaining two performance periods.\nThis contingent consideration liability is considered to be a Level 3 financial liability that is remeasured each reporting period. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration\nare recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded decreases of $0.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in the estimated fair value of contingent\nconsideration. These decreases were due to changes in estimates associated with the expected achievement of the Alphazyme revenue thresholds that would require the\nCompany to make a contingent consideration payment under the Alphazyme Securities Purchase Agreement.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the period presented (in\nthousands):\nContingent Consideration\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,003\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (1,373)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 630\n5. Balance Sheet Components\nInventory\nInventory consisted of the following as of the periods presented (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRaw materials $ 16,665 $ 19,338\nWork-in-process 10,748 12,680\nFinished goods 22,996 19,379\nTotal inventory $ 50,409 $ 51,397\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following as of the periods presented (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nEmployee related $ 14,828 $ 12,905\nAccrued interest payable 9,004 9,202\nOperating lease liabilities, current portion 7,275 6,780\nProfessional services 2,269 2,277\nAccrued property and equipment 1,124 632\nCustomer deposits 1,038 2,156\nSales and use tax liability 779 1,001\nAccrued restructuring costs 36 2,814\nAccrued MyChem Retention Payments, current portion — 19,446\nOther 2,145 3,024\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 38,498 $ 60,237\n6. Government Assistance\nCooperative Agreement\nIn May 2022, TriLink Biotechnologies, LLC (“TriLink”) entered into a cooperative agreement (the “Cooperative Agreement”) with the U.S. Department of Defense, as\nrepresented by the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense on behalf of the Biomedical Advanced Research and\nDevelopment Authority (“BARDA”), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), to advance the development of domestic manufacturing\n22\nTable of Contents\ncapabilities and to expand TriLink’s domestic production capacity in its San Diego manufacturing campus (the “Flanders San Diego Facility”) for products critical to the\ndevelopment and manufacture of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. The Cooperative Agreement has since transitioned from the U.S. Department of Defense to the HHS as of\nJanuary 2023. The Flanders San Diego Facility consists of two buildings (“Flanders I” and “Flanders II”), however, the Cooperative Agreement is exclusively involved in\nFlanders I.\nThe Cooperative Agreement requires the Company to provide the U.S. Government with conditional priority access and certain preferred pricing obligations for a 10-year period\nfrom the completion of the construction project for the production of a medical countermeasure (or a component thereof) that the Company manufactures in the Flanders San\nDiego Facility during a declared public health emergency.\nPursuant to certain requirements, BARDA awarded TriLink an amount equal to $38.8 million or 50% of the construction and validation costs currently budgeted for the\nFlanders San Diego Facility. The contract period of performance is May 2022 through January 2034, which is the effective date of the Cooperative Agreement through the\nanticipated expiration of the 10-year conditional priority access period. Amounts reimbursed are subject to audit and may be recaptured by the HHS in certain circumstances.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received $0.6 million and $5.4 million, respectively, of reimbursements under the Cooperative\nAgreement, with equal offsets recorded to property and equipment on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nthe Company received $0.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively, of reimbursements under the Cooperative Agreement, with equal offsets recorded to property and equipment\non the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has recorded a receivable of $1.4 million within prepaid expenses and other current\nassets, with an equal offset to property and equipment.\n7. Commitments and Contingencies\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are\nenforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include provisions with respect to quantities, pricing and timing of purchases.\nAmounts purchased under these obligations totaled $1.5 million and $5.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Amounts purchased\nunder these obligations totaled $0.3 million and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, future minimum commitments under these obligations were as follows (in thousands):\n2024 (remaining three months) $ 1,234\n2025 590\n2026 390\n2027 8\nTotal $ 2,222\n8. Long-Term Debt\nCredit Agreement\nIn October 2020, Maravai Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“Intermediate”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Topco LLC, along with certain of its subsidiaries (together with\nIntermediate, the “Borrowers”), entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility. In\nJanuary 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to refinance the term loan and to replace London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) with a Term\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based rate.\nAs amended, the Credit Agreement provides for a $600.0 million term loan facility, maturing October 2027 (the “Term Loan”), and a $180.0 million revolving credit facility,\nmaturing October 2025 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).\nAs of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on the Term Loan was8 .28% per annum.\nThe Credit Agreement also provides availability under the Revolving Credit Facility for the issuance of letters of credit up to an aggregate limit of $20.0 million. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company had a $0.5 million outstanding letter of credit as\n23\nTable of Contents\nsecurity for a lease agreement, which reduced the availability for the issuance of letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility to $19.5 million.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Topco LLC, together with the existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of Topco LLC\n(subject to certain exceptions), as specified in the respective guaranty agreements. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are also secured by a first-priority lien and security\ninterest in substantially all of the assets (subject to certain exceptions) of existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of Topco LLC that are loan parties.\nThe Term Loan requires mandatory quarterly principal payments of $1.4 million which began in March 2022, with all remaining outstanding principal due on maturity in\nOctober 2027.\nAs of September 30, 2024, unamortized debt issuance costs totaled $0.8 million and are recorded within other assets on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet\nas there is no borrowing balance outstanding related to the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCommencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Credit Agreement requires that we make mandatory prepayments on the Term\nLoan principal upon certain excess cash flow, subject to certain step-downs based on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio. The excess cash flow shall be reduced to 25%\nor 0% of the calculated excess cash flow if the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio was equal to or less than4 .75:1.00 or 4.25:1.00, respectively, however, no prepayment\nshall be required to the extent excess cash flow calculated for the respective period is equal to or less than $10.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s first lien net\nleverage ratio was less than 4.25:1.00. Thus, a mandatory prepayment on the Term Loan out of our excess cash flow was not required.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including, among other things, covenants limiting our ability to incur or prepay certain indebtedness, pay dividends or\ndistributions, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments and make changes to the nature of the business. Additionally, the\nCredit Agreement requires us to maintain a certain net leverage ratio if the outstanding debt balance on the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 35.0% of the aggregate amount of\navailable credit of $180.0 million, or $63.0 million. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nInterest Rate Cap\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement to manage a portion of its variable interest rate risk on its outstanding long-term debt. The\ncontract, which was effective March 31, 2021, entitles the Company to receive from the counterparty at each calendar quarter end the amount, if any, by which a specified\ndefined floating market rate exceeds the cap strike interest rate, applied to the contract’s notional amount of $415.0 million. The floating rate of interest is reset at the end of\neach three-month period. The contract was set to expire on March 31, 2023.\nIn May 2022, the Company amended the interest rate cap agreement, effective June 30, 2022, to increase the contract’s notional amount to $500.0 million and to extend the\nmaturity date to January 19, 2025. Additionally, the floating rate option changed from a LIBOR-based rate to a SOFR-based rate. Other provisions remained unchanged as a\nresult of the amendment. Premiums paid to amend the interest rate cap agreement were immaterial.\nThe interest rate cap agreement has not been designated as a hedging relationship and has been recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at fair value of $3.5\nmillion within prepaid expenses and other current assets with changes in fair value recognized within interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nProceeds from the interest rate cap agreement are reflected in cash flows used in financing activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following as of the periods presented (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTerm Loan $ 529,040 $ 533,120\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (7,317) (8,973)\nTotal long-term debt 521,723 524,147\nLess: current portion (5,440) (5,440)\nTotal long-term debt, less current portion $ 516,283 $ 518,707\nThere were no borrowing balances outstanding on the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n24\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate future principal maturities of the Company’s debt obligations based on contractual due dates, were as follows (in thousands):\n2024 (remaining three months) $ 1,360\n2025 5,440\n2026 5,440\n2027 516,800\nTotal long-term debt $ 529,040\n9. Net Loss Per Class A Common Share Attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.\nBasic net loss per Class A common share has been calculated by dividing net loss for the period, adjusted for net loss attributable to non-controlling interests, by the weighted\naverage number of Class A common shares outstanding during the period. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings,\nInc., diluted net loss per Class A common share attributable to the Company is the same as basic net loss per Class A common share attributable to the Company, since dilutive\nequity instruments are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company reported a net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.\nduring each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net loss per Class A common share attributable to the Company for the periods presented (in thousands,\nexcept per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss $ (175,955) $ (15,102) $ (213,127) $ (28,393)\nLess: loss attributable to common non-controlling interests 76,917 8,640 94,426 15,323\nNet loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. $ (99,038) $ (6,462) $ (118,701) $ (13,070)\nWeighted average Class A common shares outstanding 141,555 131,930 136,595 131,845\nNet loss per Class A common share attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.,\nbasic and diluted $ (0.70) $ (0.05) $ (0.87) $ (0.10)\nShares of Class B common stock do not share in the earnings or losses of the Company and are therefore not participating securities. As such, a separate presentation of basic\nand diluted net loss per share for Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been presented.\nThe following table presents potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because their effect would have\nbeen anti-dilutive for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRestricted stock units 1,870 3,768 2,233 3,209\nStock options 4,008 4,524 4,008 4,524\nShares estimated to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan 286 9 197 8\nShares of Class B common stock 110,684 119,094 110,684 119,094\nTotal 116,848 127,395 117,122 126,835\nShares underlying contingently issuable awards that have not met the necessary conditions as of the end of a reporting period are not included in the calculation of diluted net\nloss per Class A common share attributable to the Company for that period. The Company had contingently issuable performance stock units (“PSUs”) outstanding that did not\nmeet the market and performance conditions as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and, therefore, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per Class A common\nshare attributable to the Company. The maximum number of potentially dilutive shares that could be\n25\nTable of Contents\nissued upon vesting for such awards was insignificant as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. These share amounts were also excluded from the potentially dilutive securities in the\ntable above.\n10. Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Topco LLC, as well as any stand-alone income or loss\nwe generate. Topco LLC is organized as a limited liability company and treated as a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes and generally does not pay income taxes on its\ntaxable income in most jurisdictions. Instead, Topco LLC’s taxable income or loss is passed through to its members, including us.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s income tax expense (benefit) and effective tax rate for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nLoss before income taxes $ (175,644) $ (20,563) $ (214,980) $ (38,450)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 311 $ (5,461) $ (1,853) $ (10,057)\nEffective tax rate (0.2)% 26.6 % 0.9 % 26.2 %\nThe Company’s effective tax rate of (0.2)% and 0.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 differed from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of\n21.0%, primarily due to the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets, and the release of a previous uncertain tax position due to statute\nexpiration.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate of 26.6% and 26.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 differed from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of\n21.0%, primarily due to the loss associated with the non-controlling interest, changes to the Company’s deferred tax assets due to changes in estimates associated with its state\nincome tax rate, and the release of a previous uncertain tax position due to statute expiration.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $3.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect the\neffective tax rate if recognized. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $(1.8) million, as a component of income tax expense (benefit),\nprimarily due to statute expiration. The Company recognizes interest related to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense, including $0.2 million recognized\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nTax Distributions to Topco LLC’s Owners\nTopco LLC is subject to an operating agreement put in place at the date of the Organizational Transactions (“LLC Operating Agreement”). The LLC Operating Agreement has\nnumerous provisions related to allocations of income and loss, as well as timing and amounts of distributions to its owners. This agreement also includes a provision requiring\ncash distributions enabling its owners to pay their taxes on income passing through from Topco LLC. These tax distributions are computed based on an assumed income tax\nrate equal to the sum of (i) the maximum combined marginal U.S. federal and state income tax rate applicable to an individual and (ii) the net investment income tax. The\nassumed income tax rate currently totals 46.7%, which may increase to 54.1% in certain cases where the qualified business income deduction is unavailable.\nIn addition, under the tax rules, Topco LLC is required to allocate taxable income disproportionately to its unit holders. Because tax distributions are determined based on the\nholder of LLC Units who is allocated the largest amount of taxable income on a per unit basis, but are made pro rata based on ownership, Topco LLC is required to make tax\ndistributions that, in the aggregate, will likely exceed the amount of taxes Topco LLC would have otherwise paid if it were taxed on its taxable income at the assumed income\ntax rate. Topco LLC is subject to entity level taxation in certain states and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to entity level U.S. and foreign income taxes. As a result, the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations include income tax expense related to those states and to U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where Topco LLC or\nany of our subsidiaries are subject to income tax.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, Topco LLC did not pay tax distributions to its owners. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Topco LLC\npaid tax distributions of $1.3 million to its owners, including $0.7 million to the Company.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, Topco LLC did not pay tax distributions to its owners. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Topco LLC\npaid tax distributions of $20.3 million to its owners, including $10.7 million to the Company.\n26\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, no amounts for tax distributions had been accrued as such payments, if any, are made during the period.\n11. Related Party Transactions\nMLSH 1’s majority owner is GTCR, LLC (“GTCR”). The Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and General Counsel are also\nexecutives of MLSH 1 and MLSH 2.\nPayable to Related Parties Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nWe are a party to a Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. The TRA provides for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, of 85% of\nthe amount of certain tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of the Organizational Transactions, our initial\npublic offering (“IPO”) and any subsequent purchases or exchanges of LLC Units of Topco LLC. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of any cash tax\nsavings that it realizes.\nWe recognize the amount of TRA payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months and classify this amount as current. This determination is based on our taxable\nincome for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the current liability under the TRA was $7.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had derecognized the remaining $665.3 million non-current liability under the TRA after concluding it was not probable that the\nCompany will be able to realize the remaining tax benefits based on estimates of future taxable income. The estimation of liability under the TRA is by its nature imprecise and\nsubject to significant assumptions regarding the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income in the future. If the Company concludes in a future period that the tax\nbenefits are more likely than not to be realized and releases its valuation allowance, the corresponding TRA liability amounts may be considered probable at that time and\nrecorded on the consolidated balance sheet and within earnings. There have been no changes to our position from those set forth in the 2023 Form 10-K. The impact of any\nactivity for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, including any exchanges or changes to our estimated state tax rate, will be included in the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 when amounts are determinable.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our liability under the TRA was $7.1 million, payable to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, representing approximately 85% of the calculated tax savings based\non our estimate of taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our liability under the TRA was $7.2 million.\nWe made payments of $42.6 million in the aggregate to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the TRA during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which $0.4 million\nwas related to interest. No such payments were made during the three months ended September 30, 2023 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nContribution, Exchange and Forfeiture Agreement with MLSH 1\nIn connection with the Company’s acquisition of Alphazyme, which was completed in January 2023, the Company undertook a series of structuring transactions (the\n“Structuring Transactions”), including:\n• On January 18, 2023, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Alphazyme.\n• On January 19, 2023, the Company entered into a contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with Alphazyme Holdings, Inc. (“Alphazyme Holdings”), a\nwholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which the Company contributed all such membership interests in Alphazyme (the “Alphazyme Membership\nInterest”) to Alphazyme Holdings.\n• On January 22, 2023, Alphazyme Holdings entered into a contribution and exchange agreement (the “Contribution and Exchange Agreement”) with Topco LLC,\npursuant to which it contributed all of the Alphazyme Membership Interests to TopCo LLC in exchange for 5,059,134 newly-issued LLC Units of Topco LLC at a price\nper unit of $13.87, which was equal to the 50-day volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock as calculated on January 18, 2023 (the\n“Contribution and Exchange”).\n• Immediately following the Contribution and Exchange, the Company entered into a forfeiture agreement (the “Forfeiture Agreement”) with Alphazyme Holdings, TopCo\nLLC and MLSH 1, a related party, pursuant to which each of the Company (together with Alphazyme Holdings) and MLSH 1 agreed to forfeit 5,059,134 and 4,871,970\nLLC Units, respectively, representing 3.7% of the Company’s (together with Alphazyme Holdings) and MLSH 1’s respective LLC Units of Topco LLC, and an equal\nnumber of shares of the Company’s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, were forfeited by MLSH 1, in each case for no consideration.\n27\nTable of Contents\nTopco LLC Operating Agreement\nMLSH 1 is party to the LLC Operating Agreement put in place at the date of the Organizational Transactions. This agreement includes a provision requiring cash distributions\nenabling its owners to pay their taxes on income passing through from Topco LLC. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made cash\ndistributions of $0.6 million and $9.6 million, respectively, for tax liabilities to MLSH 1 under this agreement. No such cash distributions were made during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n12. Segments\nThe Company’s financial performance is reported in two segments. A description of each segment follows:\n• Nucleic Acid Production: focuses on the manufacturing and sale of highly modified nucleic acids products to support the needs of customers’ research, therapeutic and\nvaccine programs. This segment also provides research products for labeling and detecting proteins in cells and tissue samples.\n• Biologics Safety Testing: focuses on the manufacturing and sale of host cell protein, bioprocess impurity detection, viral clearance prediction kits and associated\nproducts. This segment also provides services for custom antibody development, assay development, antibody affinity extraction and mass spectrometry that are utilized\nby our customers in their biologic drug manufacturing spectrum.\nThe Company has determined that adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is the profit or loss measure that the CODM uses\nto make resource allocation decisions and evaluate segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA assists management in comparing the segment performance on a consistent basis\nfor purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the core operations and, therefore, are not\nincluded in measuring segment performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, certain non-cash items\nand other adjustments that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance from period to period. Corporate costs, net of eliminations, are managed on a\nstandalone basis and are not allocated to segments.\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe following schedule includes revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each of the Company’s reportable operating segments (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nNucleic Acid Production $ 49,947 $ 51,228 $ 154,446 $ 165,944\nBiologics Safety Testing 15,253 15,638 48,333 48,863\nTotal reportable segments’ revenue $ 65,200 $ 66,866 202,779 214,807\nIntersegment eliminations — (1) — (3)\nTotal $ 65,200 $ 66,865 $ 202,779 $ 214,804\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\nNucleic Acid Production $ 15,456 $ 16,591 $ 46,845 $ 58,656\nBiologics Safety Testing 10,928 11,246 34,299 35,307\nTotal reportable segments’ adjusted EBITDA 26,384 27,837 81,144 93,963\nReconciliation of total reportable segments’ adjusted EBITDA to loss before income\ntaxes\nAmortization (6,891) (6,870) (20,629) (20,487)\nDepreciation (5,044) (4,071) (15,386) (8,966)\nInterest expense (13,634) (11,637) (36,437) (30,492)\nInterest income 7,071 7,432 21,367 20,268\nCorporate costs, net of eliminations (13,645) (15,937) (43,693) (49,188)\nOther adjustments:\nAcquisition contingent consideration 178 (2,385) 1,373 (69)\nAcquisition integration costs (919) (3,268) (4,641) (9,198)\nStock-based compensation (13,050) (9,987) (38,870) (25,246)\nMerger and acquisition related expenses (833) (46) (863) (3,708)\nFinancing costs (114) — (114) —\nAcquisition related tax adjustment 67 77 (2,374) (1,370)\nTax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (39) (1,007) (39) (2,342)\nGoodwill impairment (154,239) — (154,239) —\nRestructuring costs (1) 10 — (1) —\nOther (946) (701) (1,578) (1,615)\nLoss before income taxes (175,644) (20,563) (214,980) (38,450)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (311) 5,461 1,853 10,057\nNet loss $ (175,955) $ (15,102) $ (213,127) $ (28,393)\n___________________\n(1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was an immaterial amount of stock-based compensation expense in connection with the restructuring included in the stock based-\ncompensation line item.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, intersegment\nrevenue was immaterial between the Nucleic Acid Production and Biologics Safety Testing segments. Any intersegment revenue and the related gross margin on inventory\nrecorded at the end of the period are eliminated for consolidation purposes. Internal selling prices for intersegment sales are consistent with the segment’s normal retail price\noffered to external parties. There was no commission expense recognized for intersegment revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company does not allocate assets to its reportable segments as they are not included in the review performed by the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance\nand allocating resources.\n29\nTable of Contents\n13. Subsequent Events\nThird Amendment to Credit Agreement\nOn October 1, 2024, certain amendments to the Credit Agreement set forth in a Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Third Amendment”) became effective, including\nan extension of the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility provided under the Credit Agreement from October 2025 to October 2029 (subject to springing maturity\nprovisions based on the maturity of the Term Loan ). In connection with the Third Amendment, the lenders’ aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility were\nreduced from $180.0 million to $167.0 million, and remain undrawn as of the date hereof. No other material terms under the Credit Agreement were changed in connection with\nthe Third Amendment.\nPending Acquisition of Officinae Bio\nIn November 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the DNA and RNA business of Officinae Bio (“Officinae”), a privately held technology\ncompany with a proprietary digital platform designed with artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to support the biological design of therapeutics. The\nacquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in early 2025. The total consideration to acquire Officinae consisted of a base cash provisional\npurchase price of $10.0 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, and potential contingent consideration payments of up to $35.0 million, with $5.0 million of\nsuch contingent consideration payable in cash upon the achievement of a certain milestone and up to an additional $30.0 million payable in a mix of cash and shares of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock upon the achievement of certain milestones.\n30\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This discussion and analysis reflects our historical results of\noperations and financial position and contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed\nin or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled\n“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Please also see the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements.” We were incorporated in August 2020 and, pursuant to the Organizational Transactions described in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements,\nbecame a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Topco LLC. As the sole managing member of Topco LLC, we operate and control the\nbusiness and affairs of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, we consolidate Topco LLC in our consolidated financial statements and report a non-controlling interest\nrelated to the portion of Topco LLC not owned by us. Because the Organizational Transactions were considered transactions between entities under common control, the\nconsolidated financial statements for periods prior to the Organizational Transactions and the initial public offering have been adjusted to combine the previously separate\nentities for presentation purposes. Unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to “we,” “us” or “our” refer to\nMaravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe are a leading life sciences company providing critical products to enable the development of drug therapies, diagnostics, novel vaccines and support research on human\ndiseases. Our customers include the top global biopharmaceutical companies ranked by research and development expenditures according to industry consultants, and many\nother emerging biopharmaceutical and life sciences research companies, as well as leading academic research institutions and in vitro diagnostics companies. Our products\naddress the key phases of biopharmaceutical development and include complex nucleic acids for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, antibody-based products to detect\nimpurities during the production of biopharmaceutical products, and products to detect the expression of proteins in tissues of various species.\nWe have and will continue to build a transformative life sciences products company by acquiring businesses and accelerating their growth through capital infusions and industry\nexpertise. Biomedical innovation is dependent on a reliable supply of reagents in the fields of nucleic acid production, biologics safety testing and protein labeling. From\ninventive startups to the world’s leading biopharmaceutical, vaccine, diagnostics and gene and cell therapy companies, these customers turn to us to solve their complex\ndiscovery challenges and help them streamline and scale their supply chain needs beginning from research and development through clinical trials to commercialization.\nOur primary customers are biopharmaceutical companies who are pursuing novel research and product development programs. Our customers also include a range of\ngovernment, academic and biotechnology institutions.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we employed a team of over 580 full-time employees, approximately 27% of whom have advanced degrees.\nWe primarily utilize a direct sales model for our sales to our customers in North America. Our international sales, primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific, are through a\ncombination of third-party distributors as well as via a direct sales model. The percentage of our total revenue derived from customers in North America was 53.2% and 49.5%\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The percentage of our total revenue derived from customers in North America was 51.6% and 50.9% for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nWe generated revenue of $65.2 million and $202.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $66.9 million and $214.8 million for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nTotal revenue by segment was $49.9 million in Nucleic Acid Production and $15.3 million in Biologics Safety Testing for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $51.2 million and $15.6 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nTotal revenue by segment was $154.4 million in Nucleic Acid Production and $48.3 million in Biologics Safety Testing for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $165.9 million and $48.9 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nWe focus a substantial portion of our resources supporting our core business segments. We are actively pursuing opportunities to expand our customer base both domestically\nand internationally by fostering strong relationships with both existing and new\n31\nTable of Contents\ncustomers and distributors. Our management team has experience working with biopharmaceutical, vaccine, diagnostics and gene and cell therapy companies as well as\nacademic and research scientists. We also intend to continue making investments in our overall infrastructure and business segments to support our growth. We incurred\naggregate selling, general and administrative expenses of $39.1 million and $120.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $38.9\nmillion and $112.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nOur research and development efforts are geared towards supporting our customers’ needs. We incurred research and development expenses of $4.3 million and $14.7 million\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $4.3 million and $12.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. We intend to continue to invest in research and development and new products and technologies to support our customers’ needs for the foreseeable future.\nRecent Developments\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn connection with preparing our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we tested our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in response to\nimpairment indicators identified during our forecasting process. We revised our long-term forecast to reflect lower projected near term revenues due to lower demand in\nresearch and discovery products within our Nucleic Acid Production business. This revision also considered the slower than expected transition to new mRNA clinical trials as\ncustomers prioritize existing programs and more conservatively invest in new programs as the results of continued macroeconomic pressures. As such, we performed a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test on each of our four reporting units and as a result, we concluded that the TriLink reporting unit, which is contained in the Nucleic Acid\nProduction segment, had a carrying value that exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded goodwill impairment of $154.2 million on the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. No impairment was recorded for any of our remaining three reporting units. See Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained\nin Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nOur results of operations and cash flows substantially benefit from high-volume sales of our proprietary CleanCap® analogs for commercial phase vaccine programs. We\nestimate that revenue from high-volume sales of CleanCap for commercial phase vaccine programs represented approximately 25.4% and 19.7% of our total revenues for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The amount, timing and durability of future high-volume CleanCap orders have become increasingly difficult to\nforecast because historical customers for such orders have been unable or unwilling to provide visibility into their anticipated future needs and plans to purchase CleanCap. If\nhigh-volume orders for CleanCap do not materialize in the future at similar or greater levels than they have in the past it will significantly decrease our revenue and cash flow\nwhich, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition in the future.\nWhile we believe that the long-term trend of biopharmaceutical customers relying on outside parties to provide important inputs and services for their clinical research and\nmanufacturing remains a long-term growth driver for us, lower demand for research and discovery products within our Nucleic Acid Production business coupled with a slower\nthan expected mRNA clinical trial progressions negatively impacted our revenue and operating results in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, may continue and result in\nslower growth and/or cause a further decline in our revenues in the future.\nOur businesses also continue to see headwinds from a general contraction in economic activity in Asia, particularly in China, which has negatively impacted our revenue\nderived from those markets.\nHow We Assess Our Business\nWe consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of our business. The key measures we use to determine how our business is performing\nare revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial performance measure that we define as net loss adjusted for interest, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization and\nstock-based compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items, that we\ndo not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the financial performance of our business and the effectiveness of our business strategies. We present Adjusted EBITDA\nbecause we believe this performance measure is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry and they facilitate\ncomparisons of performance on a\n32\nTable of Contents\nconsistent basis across reporting periods. Further, we believe this performance measure is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because it excludes items that\nare not indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of the financial covenant under the Credit Agreement that governs our ability to\naccess more than $63.0 million in aggregate letters of credit and available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, if we borrow more than $63.0 million\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to maintain a specified net leverage ratio. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Agreement” below for a\ndiscussion of this financial covenant.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP-based measure and, therefore, may have limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We may in the future incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. In particular, we\nexpect to incur meaningful share-based compensation expense in the future. Other limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect:\n• all expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n• changes in our working capital needs;\n• provision for income taxes, which may be a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate;\n• the costs of replacing the assets being depreciated, which will often have to be replaced in the future;\n• the non-cash component of employee compensation expense; and\n• the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations.\nIn addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our\nindustry or across different industries.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists primarily of product revenue and, to a much lesser extent, service revenue. We generated total consolidated revenue of $65.2 million and $202.8 million\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $66.9 million and $214.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively, through the following segments: (i) Nucleic Acid Production and (ii) Biologics Safety Testing.\nNucleic Acid Production Segment\nOur Nucleic Acid Production segment focuses on the manufacturing and sale of highly modified nucleic acids products to support the needs of customers’ research, therapeutic\nand vaccine programs. This segment also provides research products for labeling and detecting proteins in cells and tissue samples.\nBiologics Safety Testing Segment\nOur Biologics Safety Testing segment focuses on manufacturing and selling biologics safety and impurity tests and assay development services that are utilized by our\ncustomers in their biologic drug manufacturing activities.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our products primarily consists of manufacturing related costs incurred in the production process, including personnel and related costs, stock-\nbased compensation expense, inventory write-downs, costs of materials, labor and overhead, packaging and delivery costs and allocated costs, including facilities, information\ntechnology, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. Cost of revenue also includes adjustments for excess, obsolete or expired inventory, and idle capacity. Cost of revenue\nassociated with our services primarily consists of personnel and related costs, stock-based compensation expense, cost of materials and allocated costs, including facilities and\ninformation technology costs. Costs of services were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our employees in our commercial sales\nfunctions, marketing, executive, accounting and finance, legal and human resource functions as well as travel expenses, professional services fees, such as consulting, audit, tax\nand legal fees, general corporate costs and allocated costs, including facilities, information technology and amortization of intangibles.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will gradually increase in future periods, primarily due to our expanding facilities footprint to support\nanticipated long-term growth in the business, costs incurred in increasing our presence globally, and increases in marketing activities to drive awareness and adoption of our\nproducts and services.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense, outside contracted services, cost of supplies, in-process research and\ndevelopment costs from asset acquisitions and allocated facilities costs for employees engaged in research and development of products and services. We expense all research\nand development costs in the period in which they are incurred. Payment made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are recognized as\nprepaid assets until the goods are received or services are rendered.\nWe expect our research and development costs will increase to support our research and development efforts, including meeting our customers’ needs.\nChange in Estimated Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration consists of fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities associated with completed acquisitions. These\nadjustments are based on our assessment of the probability of achieving certain revenue thresholds and other probability factors.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill impairment is recorded in connection with the impairment testing of our goodwill, and is performed at least annually and more frequently if changes in facts and\ncircumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting units may be less than the carrying amount. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test which resulted in goodwill impairment of $154.2 million. See Note 3 to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRestructuring\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, restructuring costs (benefit) primarily consisted of the stock-based compensation benefit recognized for the forfeiture of stock\nawards upon the termination of certain impacted employees resulting from a Cost Realignment Plan, which was implemented in November 2023.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our outstanding debt, changes in the fair value of our\ninterest rate cap agreement, and interest costs on our finance lease liabilities.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances and short-term investments in money market funds held at financial institutions.\nChange in Payable to Related Parties Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment reflects changes in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability recorded in our condensed consolidated balance sheets primarily\ndue to changes in our estimated state apportionment and the corresponding change of our estimated state tax rate.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nAs a result of our ownership of LLC Units in Topco LLC, we are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income\nof Topco LLC and will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss, net assets and comprehensive income or loss of our consolidated subsidiaries that is not allocable to the\nCompany based on our percentage of ownership of such entities. Income or loss attributed to the non-controlling interests is based on the LLC Units outstanding during the\nperiod and is presented on the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, we held approximately 56.1% of the outstanding LLC Units of\nTopco LLC, and MLSH 1 held approximately 43.9% of the outstanding LLC Units of Topco LLC.\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q. For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance or potential significance to us, see Note 1 to the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenue $ 65,200 $ 66,865 (2.5)%\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenue (1) 36,826 36,686 0.4 %\nSelling, general and administrative (1) 39,087 38,864 0.6 %\nResearch and development (1) 4,344 4,347 (0.1)%\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (178) 2,385 (107.5)%\nGoodwill impairment 154,239 — *\nRestructuring (1) (4) — *\nTotal operating expenses 234,314 82,282 184.8 %\nLoss from operations (169,114) (15,417) 996.9 %\nOther expense, net (6,530) (5,146) 26.9 %\nLoss before income taxes (175,644) (20,563) 754.2 %\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 311 (5,461) (105.7)%\nNet loss (175,955) (15,102) 1065.1 %\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests (76,917) (8,640) 790.2 %\nNet loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. $ (99,038) $ (6,462) 1432.6 %\nNet loss per Class A common share attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.,\nbasic and diluted $ (0.70) $ (0.05)\nWeighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 141,555 131,930\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP financial measure) $ 12,739 $ 11,900\n35\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenue $ 202,779 $ 214,804 (5.6)%\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenue (1) 113,432 113,635 (0.2)%\nSelling, general and administrative (1) 120,528 112,912 6.7 %\nResearch and development (1) 14,660 12,686 15.6 %\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (1,373) 69 *\nGoodwill impairment 154,239 — *\nRestructuring (1) (1,220) — *\nTotal operating expenses 400,266 239,302 67.3 %\nLoss from operations (197,487) (24,498) 706.1 %\nOther expense, net (17,493) (13,952) 25.4 %\nLoss before income taxes (214,980) (38,450) 459.1 %\nIncome tax benefit (1,853) (10,057) (81.6)%\nNet loss (213,127) (28,393) 650.6 %\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interests (94,426) (15,323) 516.2 %\nNet loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. $ (118,701) $ (13,070) 808.2 %\nNet loss per Class A common share attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.,\nbasic and diluted $ (0.87) $ (0.10)\nWeighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 136,595 131,845\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP financial measure) $ 37,451 $ 44,775\n____________________\n* Not meaningful\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense (benefit) as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nCost of revenue $ 2,470 $ 2,169 13.9 %\nSelling, general and administrative 9,294 7,094 31.0 %\nResearch and development 1,280 724 76.8 %\nRestructuring 6 — *\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 13,050 $ 9,987 30.7 %\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\nCost of revenue $ 7,801 $ 5,676 37.4 %\nSelling, general and administrative 28,594 17,647 62.0 %\nResearch and development 3,696 1,923 92.2 %\nRestructuring (1,221) — *\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 38,870 $ 25,246 54.0 %\n36\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nConsolidated revenue by segment was as follows for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Percentage of Revenue\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023\nNucleic Acid Production $ 49,947 $ 51,228 (2.5)% 76.6 % 76.6 %\nBiologics Safety Testing 15,253 15,637 (2.5)% 23.4 % 23.4 %\nTotal revenue $ 65,200 $ 66,865 (2.5)% 100.0 % 100.0 %\nNine Months Ended September 30, Percentage of Revenue\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023\nNucleic Acid Production $ 154,446 $ 165,944 (6.9)% 76.2 % 77.3 %\nBiologics Safety Testing 48,333 48,860 (1.1)% 23.8 % 22.7 %\nTotal revenue $ 202,779 $ 214,804 (5.6)% 100.0 % 100.0 %\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nTotal revenue was $65.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $66.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, representing a\ndecrease of $1.7 million, or 2.5%.\nNucleic Acid Production revenue decreased from $51.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $49.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrepresenting a decrease of $1.3 million, or 2.5%. The decrease in Nucleic Acid Production revenue was primarily driven by lower demand for research and discovery products.\nBiologics Safety Testing revenue decreased from $15.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nrepresenting a decrease of $0.4 million, or 2.5%. The decrease in Biologics Safety Testing revenue was primarily driven by lower demand in the bioprocessing market.\nComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nTotal revenue was $202.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $214.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, representing a\ndecrease of $12.0 million, or 5.6%.\nNucleic Acid Production revenue decreased from $165.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $154.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, representing a decrease of $11.5 million, or 6.9%. The decrease in Nucleic Acid Production revenue was primarily driven by lower demand for research and discovery\nproducts.\nBiologics Safety Testing revenue decreased from $48.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $48.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrepresenting a decrease of $0.5 million, or 1.1%, which was not significant.\nSegment Information\nManagement has determined that adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization is the profit or loss measure used to make resource allocation decisions\nand evaluate segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA assists management in comparing the segment performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-\nmaking by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the core operations and, therefore, are not included in measuring segment\nperformance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, certain non-cash items and other adjustments that we do not consider\nin our evaluation of ongoing operating performance from period to period. Corporate costs, net of eliminations, are managed on a standalone basis and are not allocated to\nsegments.\nWe do not allocate assets to our reportable segments as they are not included in the review performed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker for purposes of assessing segment\nperformance and allocating resources.\nAs of September 30, 2024, all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe following schedule includes revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each of our reportable operating segments (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nNucleic Acid Production $ 49,947 $ 51,228 $ 154,446 $ 165,944\nBiologics Safety Testing 15,253 15,638 48,333 48,863\nTotal reportable segments’ revenue 65,200 66,866 202,779 214,807\nIntersegment eliminations — (1) — (3)\nTotal $ 65,200 $ 66,865 $ 202,779 $ 214,804\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\nNucleic Acid Production $ 15,456 $ 16,591 $ 46,845 $ 58,656\nBiologics Safety Testing 10,928 11,246 34,299 35,307\nTotal reportable segments’ adjusted EBITDA 26,384 27,837 81,144 93,963\nReconciliation of total reportable segments’ adjusted EBITDA to loss before income\ntaxes\nAmortization (6,891) (6,870) (20,629) (20,487)\nDepreciation (5,044) (4,071) (15,386) (8,966)\nInterest expense (13,634) (11,637) (36,437) (30,492)\nInterest income 7,071 7,432 21,367 20,268\nCorporate costs, net of eliminations (13,645) (15,937) (43,693) (49,188)\nOther adjustments:\nAcquisition contingent consideration 178 (2,385) 1,373 (69)\nAcquisition integration costs (919) (3,268) (4,641) (9,198)\nStock-based compensation (13,050) (9,987) (38,870) (25,246)\nMerger and acquisition related expenses (833) (46) (863) (3,708)\nFinancing costs (114) — (114) —\nAcquisition related tax adjustment 67 77 (2,374) (1,370)\nTax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (39) (1,007) (39) (2,342)\nGoodwill impairment (154,239) — (154,239) —\nRestructuring costs (1) 10 — (1) —\nOther (946) (701) (1,578) (1,615)\nLoss before income taxes (175,644) (20,563) (214,980) (38,450)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit (311) 5,461 1,853 10,057\nNet loss $ (175,955) $ (15,102) $ (213,127) $ (28,393)\n___________________\n(1) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was an immaterial amount of stock-based compensation expense in connection with the restructuring included in the stock based-\ncompensation line item.

These retention\npayments arise from the Company’s agreements executed in connection with its acquisitions of MyChem and Alphazyme and provide incremental financial incentives, over and above\nrecurring compensation, to ensure the employees of these companies remain present and participate in integration of the acquired businesses during the integration and knowledge transfer\nperiods. The Company agreed to pay certain employees of Alphazyme retention payments totaling $9.3 million as of various dates but primarily through December 31, 2025, as long as\nthese individuals continue to be employed by the Company. The Company agreed to pay the sellers of MyChem retention payments totaling $20.0 million as of the second anniversary of\nthe closing of the acquisition date as long as two senior employees (who were also the sellers of MyChem) continue to be employed by TriLink. The Company considers the payment of\nthese retention payments as probable and is recognizing compensation expense related to these payments in the post-acquisition period ratably over the service period. Retention payment\nexpenses were $0.8 million (Alphazyme $0.8 million) and $4.3 million (MyChem $1.8 million; Alphazyme $2.5 million) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively. Retention payment expenses were $3.1 million (MyChem $2.4 million; Alphazyme $0.7 million) and $8.6 million (MyChem $6.8 million; Alphazyme $1.8 million) for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Retention expenses for MyChem concluded in the first quarter of 2024, and following the payments in the first quarter of\n2024, there are no further retention expenses payable for MyChem. The remaining retention accrual for Alphazyme is $4.2 million, expected to be accrued ratably each quarter through\nDecember 31, 2025, with payments expected to be made in the first quarter of 2026. There are no further cash-based retention payments planned, other than those disclosed above, for\nacquisitions completed as of September 30, 2024.\n(3) Refers to non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation.\n(4) Refers to diligence, legal, accounting, tax and consulting fees incurred associated with acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated.\n(5) Refers to transaction costs related to the refinancing of our long-term debt that are not capitalizable.\n(6) Refers to non-cash (income) expense associated with adjustments to the indemnification asset recorded in connection with the acquisition of MyChem.\n(7) Refers to the adjustment of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability primarily due to changes in our estimated state apportionment and the corresponding change of our estimated state tax\nrate.\n39\nTable of Contents\n(8) Refers to goodwill impairment recorded for our Nucleic Acid Production segment.\n(9) Refers to restructuring costs (benefit) associated with the Cost Realignment Plan, which was implemented in November 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based\ncompensation benefit of $1.2 million related to forfeited stock awards in connection with the restructuring is included on the stock-based compensation line item. For the three months\nended September 30, 2024, such amount was immaterial.\n(10)For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, refers to loss on abandoned projects, severance payments, inventory step-up charges and certain other adjustments in connection\nwith the acquisition of Alphazyme, and other non-recurring costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, refers to severance payments, legal settlement amounts,\ninventory step-up charges in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme, certain working capital and other adjustments related to the acquisition of MyChem, and other non-recurring\ncosts.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses included the following for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Percentage of Revenue\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023\nCost of revenue $ 36,826 $ 36,686 0.4 % 56.5 % 54.9 %\nSelling, general and administrative 39,087 38,864 0.6 % 59.9 % 58.1 %\nResearch and development 4,344 4,347 (0.1)% 6.7 % 6.5 %\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (178) 2,385 (107.5)% (0.3)% 3.6 %\nGoodwill impairment 154,239 — * 236.6 % — %\nRestructuring (4) — * 0.0 % — %\nTotal operating expenses $ 234,314 $ 82,282 184.8 % 359.4 % 123.1 %\nNine Months Ended September 30, Percentage of Revenue\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023\nCost of revenue $ 113,432 $ 113,635 (0.2)% 56.0 % 52.9 %\nSelling, general and administrative 120,528 112,912 6.7 % 59.4 % 52.6 %\nResearch and development 14,660 12,686 15.6 % 7.2 % 5.9 %\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (1,373) 69 * (0.7)% 0.0 %\nGoodwill impairment 154,239 — * 76.1 % — %\nRestructuring (1,220) — * (0.6)% — %\nTotal operating expenses $ 400,266 $ 239,302 67.3 % 197.4 % 111.4 %\n____________________\n* Not meaningful\nCost of Revenue\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nCost of revenue increased by $0.1 million from $36.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $36.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nor 0.4%, which was not significant.\nGross profit margin decreased by 1.6% from 45.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 43.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was not\nsignificant.\nComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nCost of revenue decreased by $0.2 million from $113.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $113.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nor 0.2%, which was not significant.\nGross profit margin decreased by 3.0% from 47.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 44.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in\ngross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher stock-based compensation, facilities, and depreciation expense as a percentage of sales.\n40\nTable of Contents\nSelling, General and Administrative\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $0.2 million from $38.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $39.1 million for the three months\nended September 30, 2024, or 0.6%, which was not significant.\nComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $7.6 million from $112.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $120.5 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, or 6.7%. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $10.9 million in stock-based compensation expense and $5.2 million in depreciation\nexpense driven by new facilities and an increase in assets placed in service during the current year. These were partially offset by a decrease of $6.7 million in professional\nservice fees primarily driven by lower expenses related to merger and acquisitions, legal costs, and contract services, as well as further decreases of $1.3 million in marketing\nexpenses and $0.5 million in personnel expenses primarily as a result of the Cost Realignment Plan, which was implemented in November 2023.\nResearch and Development\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nResearch and development expenses were $4.3 million for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nResearch and development expenses increased by $2.0 million from $12.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $14.7 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, or 15.6%. The increase in expenses compared to the prior year was primarily driven by increases of $1.8 million in stock-based compensation expense,\n$1.2 million in professional service fees for external analytic studies, $0.8 million in supplies and materials, and $0.3 million in depreciation expense.\nChange in Estimated Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nComparison of Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe increase in change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration of $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to an increase in estimated fair\nvalue of the liability for the contingent payments associated with the acquisition of Alphazyme.\nComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe decrease in change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration of $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a decrease in estimated fair\nvalue of the liability for the contingent payments associated with the acquisition of Alphazyme.\nGoodwill Impairment\nComparison of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nIn connection with preparing our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we tested our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in response to\nimpairment indicators identified during our forecasting process. We revised our long-term forecast to reflect lower projected near term revenues due to lower demand in\nresearch and discovery products within our Nucleic Acid Production business. This revision also considered the slower than expected transition to new mRNA clinical trials as\ncustomers prioritize existing programs and more conservatively invest in new programs as the results of continued macroeconomic pressures. As such, we performed a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test on each of our four reporting units and as a result, we concluded that the TriLink reporting unit, which is contained in the Nucleic Acid\nProduction segment, had a carrying value that exceeded its estimated fair value. As a result, we recorded goodwill impairment of $154.2 million during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.

The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.0 million increase in interest expense primarily due to changes in the fair value of our interest\nrate cap agreement. The increase in Other expense was further driven by a $0.4 million decrease in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances, which\nincluded short-term investments in money market funds. These increases were offset by the change in payable to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement of\n$1.0 million in the prior year as a result of changes in our estimated state income tax apportionment and a corresponding change in our estimated state income tax rate.\nComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nOther expense was $14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing an\nincrease of $3.5 million, or 25.4%. The increase was primarily attributable to a $5.9 million increase in interest expense primarily due to changes in the fair value of our interest\nrate cap agreement and higher interest costs on our finance lease liabilities. The increase was further driven by a $1.0 million adjustment to the indemnification asset recorded in\nconnection with the acquisition of MyChem. These increases were offset by the change in payable to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement of $2.3 million in\nthe prior year as a result of changes in our estimated state income tax apportionment and a corresponding change in our estimated state income tax rate, and a $1.1 million\nincrease in interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances, which included short-term investments in money market funds.\n42\nTable of Contents\nRelationship with GTCR, LLC (“GTCR”)\nAs of September 30, 2024, investment entities affiliated with GTCR collectively controlled approximately 52% of the voting power of our common stock, which enables GTCR\nto control the vote of all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and to control the election of members of our Board of Directors and all other corporate decisions.\nWe made cash distributions of $0.6 million and $9.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for tax liabilities to MLSH 1, which is\ncontrolled by investment entities affiliates with GTCR and is the only holder of LLC Units other than us and our wholly owned subsidiaries. No such cash distributions were\nmade during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nWe are also a party to a Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, with MLSH 1, which is primarily owned by GTCR, and MLSH 2 (see Note 11 to the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). The TRA provides for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, of 85%\nof the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, from exchanges of LLC Units (together with the corresponding\nshares of Class B common stock) for Class A common stock, as a result of (i) certain increases in the tax basis of assets of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from\npurchases or exchanges of LLC Units, (ii) certain tax attributes of the entities acquired from MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 in connection with the Organizational Transactions, Topco\nLLC and subsidiaries of Topco LLC that existed prior to the IPO, and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to\npayments that we make under the TRA (collectively, the “Tax Attributes”). Payment obligations under the TRA are not conditioned upon any Topco LLC unitholders\nmaintaining a continued ownership interest in us or Topco LLC, and the rights of MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 under the TRA are assignable. There is no stated term for the TRA, and\nthe TRA will continue until all tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the TRA for an agreed-upon amount.\nWe recognize the amount of TRA payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months and classify this amount as current. As of September 30, 2024, our current liability\nunder the TRA was $7.2 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had derecognized the remaining $665.3 million non-current liability under the TRA after concluding it was not probable that the\nCompany will be able to realize the remaining tax benefits based on estimates of future taxable income. There have been no changes to our position from those set forth in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The impact of any activity for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, including any exchanges\nor changes to our estimated state tax rate, will be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 when amounts are determinable.\nThe estimation of liability under the TRA is by its nature imprecise and subject to significant assumptions regarding the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income in\nthe future. If the Company concludes in a future period that the tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized and releases its valuation allowance, the corresponding TRA\nliability amounts may be considered probable at that time and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and within earnings.\nWe made payments of $42.6 million in the aggregate to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the TRA during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, of which $0.4 million\nwas related to interest. No such payments were made during the three months ended September 30, 2023 or the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have financed our operations primarily from cash flow from operations, borrowings under long-term debt agreements and, to a lesser extent, the sale of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $578.2 million and retained earnings of $167.0 million. We had positive cash flow from operations of $22.1\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nWe have historically relied on revenue derived from product and services sales, and proceeds from equity and debt financings to fund our operations to date.\nOur principal uses of cash have been to fund operations, acquisitions and capital expenditures, as well as make tax distributions to MLSH 1, make TRA payments to MLSH 1\nand MLSH 2 and make interest payments and mandatory principal payments on our long-term debt.\nWe plan to utilize our existing cash on hand, together with cash generated from operations, primarily to fund our commercial and marketing activities associated with our\nproducts and services, continued research and development initiatives, and ongoing investments into our manufacturing facilities to create efficiencies and build capacity. We\nbelieve our cash on hand, cash\n43\nTable of Contents\ngenerated from operations and continued access to our credit facilities, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\nAs a result of our ownership of LLC Units in Topco LLC, the Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable\nincome of Topco LLC and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations and we may be\nrequired to make payments under the TRA with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot precisely quantify the likely tax benefits we will\nrealize as a result of LLC Unit exchanges and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to LLC Unitholders of Topco LLC pursuant to the TRA. The foregoing numbers are\nestimates and the actual payments could differ materially. We expect to fund these payments using cash on hand and cash generated from operations. We expect that probable\nfuture payments under the TRA relating to the purchase by the Company of LLC Units from MLSH 1 and the corresponding tax attributes will be approximately $7.2 million.\nThis determination is based on our taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we determined that making a payment under the non-current portion of the TRA was not probable underA ccounting Standards\nCodification 450 - Contingencies as a result of a valuation allowance having been recorded against our deferred tax assets and, therefore, that it is more likely than not that we\nwill not generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize related tax benefits that will result in a payment under the TRA. There have been no changes to our position from\nthose set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The impact of any activity for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024,\nincluding any exchanges or changes to our estimated state tax rate, will be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 when\namounts are determinable.\nAs a result of a change of control, material breach, or our election to terminate the TRA early, (1) we could be required to make cash payments to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 that are\ngreater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the TRA, and (2) we will be required to make an\nimmediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the TRA, which payment may be made significantly in advance of\nthe actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and could have\nthe effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to finance our obligations under the TRA.\nIn addition to payments to be made under the TRA, we are also required to make tax distributions to MLSH 1 pursuant to the LLC Operating Agreement for the portion of\nincome passing through to them from Topco LLC. We made cash distributions of $0.6 million and $9.6 million during each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023. No such cash distributions were made during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nCredit Agreement\nIn October 2020, Maravai Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“Intermediate”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Topco LLC, along with certain of its subsidiaries (together with\nIntermediate, the “Borrowers”), entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility. In\nJanuary 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to refinance the term loan and to replace London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) with a Term\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based rate.\nAs amended, the Credit Agreement provides for a $600.0 million term loan facility, maturing October 2027 (the “Term Loan”), and a $180.0 million revolving credit facility\n(the “Revolving Credit Facility”).\nAs of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate on the Term Loan was 8.28% per annum. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe Credit Agreement also provides availability under the Revolving Credit Facility for letters of credit with a limit of $20.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad a $0.5 million outstanding letter of credit as security for a lease agreement, which reduced the availability for letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility to $19.5\nmillion.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Topco LLC, together with the existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of Topco LLC\n(subject to certain exceptions), as specified in the respective guaranty agreements. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are also secured by a first-priority lien and security\ninterest in substantially all of the assets (subject to certain exceptions) of existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of Topco LLC that are loan parties.\nThe Term Loan requires mandatory quarterly principal payments of $1.4 million which began in March 2022, with all remaining outstanding principal due on maturity in\nOctober 2027.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCommencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Credit Agreement requires that we make mandatory prepayments on the Term\nLoan principal upon certain excess cash flow, subject to certain step-downs based on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio. The excess cash flow shall be reduced to 25%\nor 0% of the calculated excess cash flow if the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio was equal to or less than 4.75:1.00 or 4.25:1.00, respectively, however, no prepayment\nshall be required to the extent excess cash flow calculated for the respective period is equal to or less than $10.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s first lien net\nleverage ratio was less than 4.25:1.00. Thus, a mandatory prepayment on the Term Loan out of our excess cash flow was not required.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including, among other things, covenants limiting our ability to incur or prepay certain indebtedness, pay dividends or\ndistributions, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments and make changes to the nature of the business. Additionally, the\nCredit Agreement requires us to maintain a certain net leverage ratio if the outstanding debt balance on the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 35.0% of the aggregate amount of\navailable credit of $180.0 million, or $63.0 million. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe are a party to the TRA with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. The TRA provides for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, of 85% of the amount of certain tax\nbenefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of the Organizational Transactions, IPO and any subsequent purchases or\nexchanges of LLC Units of Topco LLC.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our current liability under the TRA was $7.2 million, representing 85% of the calculated tax savings we expect to utilize for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. We may record additional liabilities under the TRA when LLC Units are exchanged in the future and as our estimates of the future utilization of the Tax\nAttributes, net operating losses and other tax benefits change. We expect to make payments under the TRA, to the extent they are required, within 125 days after the extended\ndue date of our U.S. federal income tax return for such taxable year. Interest on such payments will begin to accrue from the due date (without extensions) of such tax return at a\nrate of LIBOR (or, if LIBOR ceases to be published, a Replacement Rate) plus 100 basis points. Generally, any late payments will continue to accrue interest at LIBOR (or a\nReplacement Rate, as applicable) plus 500 basis points until such payments are made. Given the cessation of LIBOR, we have transitioned to the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (\"SOFR\") as the applicable Replacement Rate as allowable under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe payment obligations under the TRA are obligations of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. and not of Topco LLC. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments\nthat may be made under the TRA will vary, the aggregate payments that we will be required to make to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 may be substantial. Any payments made by us\nunder the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to Topco LLC and, to the extent that we are unable to\nmake payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. We anticipate funding ordinary course payments\nunder the TRA from cash flow from operations of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries, available cash and/or available borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we determined that making a payment under the non-current portion of the TRA was not probable underA ccounting Standards\nCodification 450 - Contingencies as a result of a valuation allowance having been recorded against our deferred tax assets, and therefore, that it is more likely than not that we\nwill not generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize related tax benefits that would result in a payment under the TRA. There have been no changes to our position from\nthose set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The impact of any activity for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024,\nincluding any exchanges or changes to our estimated state tax rate, will be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 when\namounts are determinable.\n45\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 22,103 $ 118,434\nInvesting activities (19,385) (109,407)\nFinancing activities 477 (61,560)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,195 $ (52,533)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $22.1 million, which was primarily attributable to non-cash depreciation and\namortization of $36.0 million, non-cash amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of $6.3 million, non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs of $2.2 million,\nnon-cash stock-based compensation of $38.9 million, and non-cash goodwill impairment of $154.2 million. These were partially offset by a net loss of $213.1 million, non-cash\ngain on the change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration of $1.4 million, and net cash outflow from the change in our operating assets and liabilities of $2.6\nmillion.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $19.4 million, which was primarily comprised of cash outflows of $23.8 million for\nproperty and equipment purchases, offset by proceeds from government assistance allocated to property and equipment of $5.4 million, and cash outflows of $1.0 million for the\npurchase of technology.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.5 million, which was primarily attributable to proceeds from the interest rate cap\nagreement of $7.1 million. This was partially offset by $4.1 million of principal repayments of long-term debt, $1.5 million of tax payments for shares withheld under employee\nequity plans, net of proceeds from the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock, $0.6 million of cash distributions for tax liabilities to MLSH 1, as required pursuant to\nthe terms of the LLC Operating Agreement, and $0.5 million of payments of finance lease liabilities.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $18.4 million, which is net of government funding under the Cooperative Agreement of $5.4\nmillion. Capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2024 are projected to be approximately $30.0 million, which is net of anticipated government funding\nrecognized. This primarily includes leasehold improvements and equipment primarily for the Flanders San Diego Facility.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nPayments due by period\nTotal 1 year 2 - 3 years 4 - 5 years 5+ years\nOperating leases (1) $ 59,543 $ 10,504 $ 19,711 $ 18,206 $ 11,122\nFinance leases (2) 32,038 3,402 7,112 7,545 13,979\nDebt obligations (3) 529,040 5,440 10,880 512,720 —\nTRA payments (4) 7,225 7,225 — — —\nUnconditional purchase obligations (5) 2,222 1,691 531 — —\nTotal $ 630,068 $ 28,262 $ 38,234 $ 538,471 $ 25,101\n46\nTable of Contents\n____________________\n(1) Represents operating lease payment obligations, excluding any renewal options we are reasonably certain to execute and have recognized as lease liabilities.\n(2) Represents finance lease payment obligations, excluding any renewal options we are reasonably certain to execute and have recognized as lease liabilities.\n(3) Represents long-term debt principal maturities, excluding interest.

See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor additional information.\nCash distributions for owner tax liabilities are required under the terms of the LLC Operating Agreement. See Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements\ncontained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding tax distributions.\nCommencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Credit Agreement requires that we make mandatory prepayments of the Term\nLoan principal upon certain excess cash flow, subject to certain step-downs based on our first lien net leverage ratio. The mandatory prepayment shall be reduced to 25% or 0%\nof the calculated excess cash flow if the first lien net leverage ratio was equal to or less than 4.75:1.00 or 4.25:1.00, respectively; however, no prepayment shall be required to\nthe extent excess cash flow calculated for the respective period is equal to or less than $10.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, our first lien net leverage ratio was less than\n4.25:1.00.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Alphazyme, which was completed in January 2023, we were initially required to make contingent payments of up to $75.0 million to the\nsellers of Alphazyme dependent upon Alphazyme meeting or exceeding defined revenue targets during each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2025. For the first performance\nperiod which ended on December 31, 2023, it was determined that the defined revenue target was not achieved. Consequently, no payment for contingent consideration was\nmade to the sellers of Alphazyme in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we may be required to make contingent payments to the sellers of Alphazyme of up to $45.0 million for\nthe remaining two performance periods. We may also be required to make certain retention payments of $9.3 million to its sellers and certain employees as of various dates but\nprimarily through December 31, 2025 as long as these individuals continue to be employed by the Company. We cannot, at this time, determine when or if the related targets\nwill be achieved or whether the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur. Therefore, such payments were not included in the table above. See\nNote 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our interim condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been\nprepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates\nand judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are based\non historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments\nabout the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions, and any such difference may be material. For a discussion of how these and other factors may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, see\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe critical accounting estimates that we believe affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements\npresented in this report are described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Except as noted below, there have been no material changes to our\ncritical accounting policies or estimates from those set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying value. Such indicators could include, but\n47\nTable of Contents\nare not limited to, current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate,\noperational performance of the business or loss of key personnel. We perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If\nmanagement concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, management performs a quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount\nexceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nIn connection with preparing our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we tested our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in response to\nimpairment indicators identified during our forecasting process. We revised our long-term forecast to reflect lower projected near term revenues due to lower demand in\nresearch and discovery products within our Nucleic Acid Production business. This revision also considered the slower than expected transition to new mRNA clinical trials as\ncustomers prioritize existing programs and more conservatively invest in new programs as the results of continued macroeconomic pressures. As such, we performed a\nquantitative goodwill impairment test and compared our reporting units’ fair values to their respective carrying values to determine whether goodwill was impaired. We\nperformed the impairment test using a combination of the income and the market approach to evaluate whether the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying\nvalue. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model, incorporating both internal estimates and market-based data, while the market approach utilizes comparable\ncompany information. The significant assumptions in the discounted cash flow models vary amongst, and are specific to, each reporting unit and include, but are not limited to,\ndiscount rates, projected revenue growth rates (including terminal growth rates) and operating margin percentages. Discount rates were determined using a weighted average\ncost of capital specific to each reporting unit and other market and industry data. These assumptions were formulated with consideration of prevailing market conditions and\nanticipated developments, including new product and service initiatives, competitive dynamics, and broader economic factors. The result of the quantitative analysis indicated\nthat the fair value of the TriLink reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value and consequently resulted in a $154.2 million impairment charge.\nThe excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for the three reporting units not\nimpaired, ranged from approximately 28% to approximately 245%. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, we\napplied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this\nhypothetical 10% decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for the three\nreporting units not impaired, ranged from approximately 16% to approximately 211%. However, to the extent that we continue to experience declines in financial performance\nor experience other impairment indicators, such as industry and market considerations, or that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values, there\ncould be a risk of goodwill impairment of our reporting units in future periods. For the TriLink reporting unit, the impairment loss recognized during the period was equal to the\ntotal amount of goodwill included in the reporting unit.\nRecoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the recoverability of our long-lived assets (including finite-lived intangible assets) if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. We measure\nrecoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying value of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from\nsuch assets. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment based on the amount by which the net carrying\namount of the assets exceeds the fair values of the assets.\nIn conjunction with the goodwill impairment assessment performed in preparing our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we also evaluated the\nrecoverability of our long-lived assets (including finite-lived intangible assets). Based on the interim impairment test, the carrying value of the assets did not exceed the current\nand expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from such assets. As a result, we determined a fair value analysis was not necessary as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. However, to the extent that we continue to experience declines in financial performance or experience other impairment indicators, such as industry and\nmarket considerations, or that the fair values of our assets are less than their carrying values, there could be a risk of impairment of our long-lived assets in future periods.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of the expected impact of recent accounting pronouncements, if any, see Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1\nof this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n48\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of September 30, 2024, our primary exposure to interest rate risk was associated with our variable rate long-term debt. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest\nat a rate equal to the Base Rate plus a margin of 2.00%, with respect to each Base Rate-based loan, or the Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin of\n3.00% with respect to each Term SOFR-based loan, subject in each case to an applicable Base Rate or Term SOFR floor (see Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Interest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including changes in the fiscal and monetary\npolicies or geopolitical events or changes in general economic conditions. This could adversely affect our cash flows.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have an interest rate cap agreement in place to hedge a portion of our variable interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term debt. The agreement\nhas a contract notional amount of $500.0 million and entitles us to receive from the counterparty at each calendar quarter end the amount, if any, by which a specified floating\nmarket rate exceeds the cap strike interest rate. The floating interest rate is reset at the end of each three-month period. The contract expires on January 19, 2025.\nWe had $529.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan and no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. For the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would have changed our interest\nexpense by approximately $1.4 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $578.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Given the short-term nature of our investments, we do not believe there is any material risk to\nthe value of our investments with increases or decreases in interest rates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAll of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Although approximately 46.8% and 50.5% of our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, was derived from international sales, primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific, all of these sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of our expenses are\ngenerally denominated in the currencies in which they are incurred, which is primarily in the United States. As we endeavor to expand our presence in international markets, to\nthe extent we are required to enter into agreements denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, results of operations and cash flows may increasingly be subject to\nfluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, we have\nnot entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our\nrisk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports\nwe file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective,\nand management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n49\nTable of Contents\nPart II.\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and\nclaims are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, are believed to,\neither individually or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, litigation\nhas the potential to have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nItem 1A.

Business\nOverview\nMaravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (also referred to in this document as “Maravai”, “we”, “us” or “the Company”) is a leading life sciences company providing critical\nproducts to enable the development of novel vaccines, drug therapies, and diagnostics, and to support research on human diseases. Our customers include the top global\nbiopharmaceutical companies ranked by research and development expenditures according to industry consultants, and many other emerging biopharmaceutical and life\nsciences research companies, as well as leading academic research institutions and in vitro diagnostics companies. Our products address the key phases of biopharmaceutical\ndevelopment spanning research to commercialization and include complex nucleic acids for vaccine, therapeutic and diagnostic applications, custom enzymes for research and\ndiagnostic use and antibody-based products to detect impurities during the production of biopharmaceutical products. We provide products that support our customers from\ndiscovery through commercialization of their vaccines, therapeutic agents and in vitro diagnostic products.\nOur businesses principally address high growth market segments in biopharmaceutical development. In particular, the field of cell and gene therapy has emerged as one of the\nfastest growing treatment modalities to address a host of human conditions. There are more than 4,000 nucleic acid and cell and gene therapies in development or launched and\nsales in this category are expected to grow more than 3 times by 2030, according to industry consultants and management estimates. Our portfolio offers key products for each\nstage of the cell and gene therapy development lifecycle. For example, our messenger RNA (“mRNA”) products are used in drug development to assist in the production of\nimmune-activating antigens and to deliver gene editing technologies in cell and gene therapy treatments; our CleanCap® technology is used to stabilize mRNA and streamlines\nmRNA manufacturing; we were one of the first companies to provide the essential modified uridine, N1-methyl-pseudouridine triphosphate, for research applications and under\ngood manufacturing processes (“GMP”) conditions; our catalog mRNA products are frequently used by lipid developers to test and validate new mRNA delivery platforms; and\nour plasmid DNA products are used as templates for the production of our mRNA products. Our oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide supply products, enzymes and NTPs are also\nincluded in the supply chain of several diagnostic, next-gen sequencing (“NGS”) and research platforms, as well as DNA and RNA synthesis end-markets. We also provide\nbiologics safety testing technology used to ensure the safety of the biological drug manufacturing process and drug products.\nOur proprietary capabilities and products underpin the value we aim to provide to our customers. Among other capabilities, we are experts in RNA and mRNA products, which\nare challenging and often unstable molecules requiring significant chemical modifications and analytical expertise to ensure their stability and efficacy in our customers’\napplications. Notably, according to research commissioned by us consisting of interviews with our current and former customers, our competitors and industry experts focused\nacross our two ongoing business segments (the “Industry Analysis”), we believe CleanCap technology is viewed as a leading solution to incorporate the five prime (“5’”) cap\ninto mRNA. CleanCap is a novel chemical approach to produce the 5’ cap analog, which, in addition to making mRNA more stable, aids in protein production and helps prevent\nan unwanted immune response to the mRNA. CleanCap analogs have been incorporated into several mRNA programs targeting\n4\nTable of Contents\nimmunization against the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”). These programs include commercial programs led by Pfizer in partnership with BioNTech and by\nBioNTech in partnership with Fosun Pharma, as well as two COVID-19 vaccines which are now approved for use in Japan. In addition to these commercially approved\nprograms, CleanCap has been incorporated into many research and clinical stage programs addressing stand-alone and combination vaccines for COVID-19 and other\nrespiratory diseases, such as Influenza that have not yet been commercialized.\nWe estimate our CleanCap products have been incorporated in approximately 350 vaccine and therapeutic programs in development as of December 31, 2023, including at least\n60 molecules for which our mRNA CDMO services group manufactured the mRNA APIs using CleanCap. These include vaccine development programs for infectious\ndiseases, including Lyme disease, malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, shingles, rabies, yellow fever, respiratory syncytial virus (“RSV”) and Zika, as well as other medical conditions.\nIn addition to infectious diseases, these programs address a number of disease states, including ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, glycogen storage disorders, Alpha-1\nantitrypsin deficiency, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hurler syndrome, ovarian cancer and cardiovascular disease. These therapeutic programs also use multiple therapeutic\nmodalities, including CRISPR/Cas-9, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), enzyme replacement therapies, allogeneic CAR-T cells and base editing. Should\none or more of these programs proceed to commercialization, we believe we will continue to supply our customers and our products will likely be incorporated in customer\nregulatory filings.\nmRNA is at the core of our capabilities. We developed our expertise in mRNA with a belief in its potential as a therapeutic modality. The first clinical trial for an mRNA\ntherapeutic agent occurred in 2016. Now, more than 900 clinical trials are in the pipeline, principally focused on vaccines against viruses and cancer vaccines. With the COVID-\n19 pandemic, mRNA has shown its potential for more rapid vaccine design and manufacture when compared to traditional techniques involving culturing inactivated virus to\nelicit an immune response. COVID-19 has helped highlight the potential advantage of mRNA as a treatment modality and directed significant resources to the growing base of\nknowledge about mRNA. This knowledge is now being directed at future vaccine programs addressing infectious diseases as well as for therapeutic agents for a host of human\ndiseases. We are positioned to serve our biopharmaceutical customers in the fast-growing field of mRNA across a range of clinical programs for a variety of diseases.\nForming long-term partnerships with our customers is core to our strategy. Today, we primarily serve our customers during the product development and process development\nphases. During product development, we collaborate with our customers to develop and synthesize nucleic acids, which in some cases comprise the active pharmaceutical\ningredient (“API”) of our customers’ products in development. We also provide our customers a host of chemically complex and highly specialized raw materials. Process\ndevelopment is a complex phase that establishes highly validated procedures and determines the investment in facilities and equipment required to bring biopharmaceutical\nproducts to market. These decisions impact the viability of our customers’ products for use in clinical trials and commercialization. During process development, we provide\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (“ELISAs”) that reduce the risk posed by impurities and contaminants in biological drugs, a critical step to ensure the safety of the drug\nproduct.\nWhile we do not provide products that are themselves regulated as drugs or in vitro diagnostics, our customers frequently incorporate our products into their highly validated\nproducts and processes. For example, we provide oligonucleotides and antibody-based products used by in vitro diagnostic product manufacturers for their on-market products.\nBecause of the extensive validation required for these products, these components are frequently purchased for the life of our customers’ products and we believe they are\nunlikely to be substituted. In addition, our analytical tools are used in the design and development of manufacturing processes and often will be used throughout the life cycle of\nour customers’ manufactured products. Once our services or products are qualified by our customers, they are often cited in regulatory documents and standard operating\nprocedures. As a result, our customer relationships frequently span many years.\nThe nature of our products and their uses require that they be manufactured by highly trained personnel in state-of-the-art facilities following exacting procedures to ensure\nquality. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 24% of our workforce have earned advanced degrees and all receive rigorous training on our procedures. During 2023, the\nmajority of our nucleic acid products were manufactured at our San Diego, California Wateridge facility (“Wateridge facility”). The Wateridge facility was purpose-built to\naddress our customers’ needs for critical raw materials manufactured under certain GMP conditions and APIs for investigational use. Our raw material products are\nmanufactured following the voluntary quality standards of ISO 9001:2015. Our GMP-grade raw materials follow ISO 9001:2015 standards, additional voluntary GMP quality\nstandards and customer specific requirements. Our API products are manufactured following the voluntary quality standards of ISO 9001:2015, the International Council for\nHarmonisation’s GMP Guide, comparable GMP principles for the European Union and customer specific requirements. We believe our products are exempt from compliance\nwith the current GMP (“cGMP”) regulations of the FDA, as our products are further processed or incorporated into final drug products by our customers and we do not make\nclaims related to their safety or effectiveness. Our other facilities are similarly designed for specific applications with quality systems to match our customers’ requirements. All\nof our manufacturing facilities meet applicable ISO standards.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWe built our business through a combination of acquisitions and subsequent investments in our acquired companies to grow their commercial capabilities, upgrade and expand\ntheir research and production facilities, deploy stringent quality systems, integrate their back-office functions, and develop the personnel and management to fuel continued\ngrowth. Today, we offer an integrated portfolio that enables innovation across the biopharmaceutical and academic markets. Mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships\nthat complement our capabilities in cell and gene therapy and biopharmaceutical production remain core to our strategy. Our strategy aims to augment our strong organic growth\nwith the addition of synergistic products and capabilities.\nOur Portfolio and Capabilities\nWe provide critical raw materials that support our customers from discovery through commercialization of their vaccines, therapeutic agents andi n vitro diagnostic products.\nOur products are frequently incorporated into our customers’ products, whether as research products or APIs used in development or products incorporated as raw materials into\non-market products. They may also be incorporated into the manufacturing process itself. We are therefore a critical part of our customers’ supply chain and they frequently\nseek to maintain their supply relationship with us for the life of their products or development programs.\nOur products address our customers’ needs for Nucleic Acid Production and Biologics Safety Testing, and our operations are aligned to these two segments. Within Nucleic\nAcid Production, we have four business units: TriLink Discovery, TriLink GMP, Glen Research and Alphazyme. Our Biologics Safety Testing business is comprised of Cygnus\nTechnologies. Our brands, products and the end markets they serve are depicted in the following image:\nNucleic Acid Production (78% of Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2023)\nWe are a global provider of highly modified, complex nucleic acids and related products. We have recognized expertise in complex chemistries and products provided under\nexacting quality standards. Our core offerings include mRNA, long and short oligonucleotides, our proprietary CleanCap mRNA capping technology, mRNA building blocks,\noligonucleotide building blocks and specialty enzymes. Our offerings address key customer needs for critical components, from research to GMP-grade raw materials and API\nmanufacturing. We market our nucleic acid products under the TriLink BioTechnologies®, Glen Research and Alphazyme brands.\nSince the 1961 discovery of mRNA and its role in converting genetic information into proteins, countless attempts had been made to harness mRNA for therapeutic purposes.\nToday, mRNA vaccines are globally recognized for their success in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe success of COVID-19 vaccines has helped highlight the potential advantage of mRNA as a treatment modality and significant investments have been made industry wide to\ndeveloping future mRNA vaccines as well as for therapeutic agents for\n6\nTable of Contents\na host of human diseases. We are positioned to serve our biopharmaceutical customers in the fast-growing field of mRNA across a range of clinical programs for a variety of\ndiseases.\nWe offer the following nucleic acid products: mRNA, RNA Capping (CleanCap), oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide inputs, nucleoside triphosphates, custom nucleic acid\nchemistry, plasmid DNA and specialty enzymes.\nmRNA. mRNA is an intermediary molecule that translates the genetic information stored in DNA into proteins. The genetic information stored in DNA is transferred to mRNA\nin a cellular process called transcription. This process occurs in the nucleus of cells. DNA, a double stranded molecule, is unwound and copied as mRNA by the enzyme RNA\npolymerase. mRNA is then transferred out of the nucleus to the cytosol, a component of the cytoplasm of a cell, where it serves as a blueprint for making cellular proteins by a\nmulti-component organelle complex called the ribosome.\nmRNA has traditionally been a difficult molecule for vaccine and therapeutic purposes. mRNA is inherently unstable compared to DNA and is susceptible to degradation by\nubiquitous enzymes called RNases. mRNAs are also physically and chemically fragile and can degrade at elevated temperatures and under shear forces that occur during\ndownstream manufacturing processes. We have developed manufacturing processes that overcome many of these obstacles, resulting in highly effective mRNA.\nWe develop and manufacture mRNA products to support vaccine and therapeutic programs from pre-clinical development through and including clinical phases, including\nscale-up and analytical development services. The mRNA molecules may serve as APIs for diverse applications, such as enzyme replacement therapies, gene editing therapies\nand vaccines. We offer both research grade material and material made under GMP conditions for early phase clinical trials.\nRNA Capping. Within the mRNA category, we also offer our patented CleanCap technology. CleanCap analogs principally serve the mRNA vaccine and therapeutics markets.\nCap analogs are a component of mRNA that aids in protein production as well as in making mRNA more stable inside cells. For mRNA to serve as a template to make a protein,\nit requires a special cap at the 5’ end of the molecule. The cap structure also affects the stability of the mRNA. Lack of a cap can result in activation of the innate immune\nsystem, which can affect the production of the desired protein or elicit undesired biological effects. We offer a suite of CleanCap analogs that are specifically made for\ntherapeutics and vaccines. CleanCap analogs are sold as a stand-alone reagents or bundled with other mRNA products. Based on the Industry Analysis, we believe our cap\nanalogs are critical features of several mRNA vaccines and therapies in development.\nTraditionally, the 5’ cap has been added in one of two ways. The cap can be added post mRNA synthesis by an enzymatic process. This enzymatic method has several\ndrawbacks, including the high cost of the capping enzymes as well as the need to perform additional processing steps to the mRNA to remove enzymes and byproducts of the\ncapping reaction. While capping efficiency is usually high, the extra processing steps typically result in degradation and mRNA of poorer quality. The second method is to add a\nsynthetic cap analog into the transcription reaction such that the mRNA is transcribed and capped in a single step. Anti-reverse cap analog (“ARCA”) is an example of a cap\nanalog that is added to the transcription reaction. This avoids the workflow challenges of the enzymatic process, but typically results in lower yields.\nLike ARCA, CleanCap analogs are synthetic, chemically-made mRNA 5’ cap analogs added to the transcription process in a single step. Unlike ARCA, however, CleanCap\nresults in significantly higher levels of capping efficiency, resulting in very low levels of uncapped mRNA, which in turn minimizes the risk of activation of the innate immune\nsystem. In addition, CleanCap’s higher mRNA yields compared to ARCA result in lower cost of goods. When compared to enzymatic capping, CleanCap removes the additional\ndownstream purification steps required.\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe currently offer several variations of the CleanCap molecule, serving the needs of mRNA and self-amplifying RNA developers. CleanCap is available in two quality grades,\nresearch use only for discovery and development activities, and a GMP-grade for clinical and commercial applications. Our newest CleanCap analog, CleanCap M6, was\nintroduced in May 2023 and is our most robust cap analog to date, enabling mRNA that delivers higher levels of protein production.\nCleanCap mRNA products represented 69% of our Nucleic Acid Production revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 (including the revenue from CleanCap products).\nOligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide product category supports broad customer applications, including therapeutics, in vitro diagnostics, NGS and CRISPR-based gene\nediting. Most of our TriLink BioTechnologies oligonucleotide products are custom manufactured DNA or RNA sequences, often highly modified and produced as research\ngrade or under GMP conditions for use in development, clinical and commercial applications.\nOligonucleotide Synthesis Inputs. Our product offerings through Glen Research include reagents and support supplies for DNA and RNA oligonucleotide synthesis, labeling,\nmodification and purification. We are a reputable and trusted vendor with a large portfolio, quality brand, knowledgeable technical support, and responsive customer service. In\naddition to oligonucleotide synthesis service providers, our customer base includes life science, biopharma, and diagnostic companies as well as academic institutions and\ngovernment organizations, all of which internally manufacture their own oligonucleotide products.\nNucleoside triphosphates. Nucleoside triphosphates (“NTPs”) are the precursors to DNA and RNA. They are composed of a nitrogen base bound to either ribose or\ndeoxyribose with three phosphate groups added to the sugar. We manufacture NTPs that are used in polymerase chain reactions (“PCR”), in sequencing reactions and in the\nmanufacture of mRNA. The NTPs can be unmodified, composed of the four standard bases, or modified, with a base altered to enhance a particular biological property, such as\nthe ability to evade the innate immune system in therapeutic applications. TriLink BioTechnologies NTPs are used by customers in both research and clinical trial applications.\nOur manufacturing capabilities for NTPs now includes both research use and GMP-grade.\nCustom Nucleic Acid Chemistry. Through our acquisition of MyChem LLC in the first quarter of 2022, TriLink BioTechnologies expanded its synthetic chemistry expertise\nand added proprietary manufacturing processes allowing for the highest purity NTP, amidite and custom nucleotide services. We serve a diverse market of diagnostics and\ntherapeutic developers that require novel molecules that are otherwise unavailable on the market. Typically, these molecules are initially manufactured in small quantities, and\nthen scaled to meet the need of larger diagnostic platform or therapeutic applications once positive candidates have been identified by the customer.\nPlasmid DNA. Unlike genomic DNA, which constitutes the chromosome, plasmid DNA exists outside the chromosome and represents small circular double-stranded\nconstructs. Plasmid DNA is frequently used as a vector for replicating nucleic acid products. Plasmid DNA is integral to the production of mRNA, serving as the nucleic acid\ntemplate for the DNA-dependent RNA polymerases that frequently are used in the manufacturing of mRNA. Our plasmid DNA offering allows us to ensure the quality and\ntimeliness of the mRNA API manufacturing campaigns that we service for our customers.\nSpecialty Enzymes. Through our acquisition of Alphazyme in the first quarter of 2023, our Nucleic Acid Production capabilities now include specialized enzymes. Enzymes are\ncritical to almost every phase of nucleic acid production. Alphazyme provides custom, scalable molecular biology enzymes with a full product line of IVT, NGS, life science\nand diagnostic enzyme solutions.\nDiscovery mRNA synthesis. Through the TriLink BioTechnologies Discovery Business unit, we offer a core set of products and services geared toward customers doing early-\nstage development work. We produce mRNA utilizing standard sequences for generalized research using customer supplied sequences for custom built constructs. We also\nprovide process development services to optimize customers’ transcription and purification processes. These services can be integrated with our CleanCap, NTP products and\nenzyme portfolios and have access to our analytical and QC method development.\nGMP mRNA synthesis. Our GMP mRNA manufacturing services offer a clear pathway for customers running clinical trials. We focus on building partnerships with our\ncustomers in the emerging market of cell and gene therapy to ensure we are well-positioned to be an extension of their development teams. Our services feature robust quality\nmanagement systems and include process development and scale-up, phase-appropriate, high-quality plasmid DNA, regulatory submission support, and in-house analytical\nservices for mRNA analysis and characterization.\nBiologics Safety Testing (22% of Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2023)\nWe provide products and services under the Cygnus Technologies®, LLC (“Cygnus Technologies”) brand that ensure the purity of our customers’ biopharmaceutical products,\nincluding biological drugs. For over 25 years, the Cygnus Technologies brand has been associated with products and services that enable the detection of impurities present in\nbioproduction. Our biologics safety testing products are used during development and scale-up, during the regulatory approval process and\n8\nTable of Contents\nthroughout commercialization. We are recognized globally for the detection of host cell proteins (“HCPs”) and process-related impurities during bioproduction.\nOur customers in this segment manufacture a broad range of biopharmaceutical products. These include monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins, both as novel\nbiologics and biosimilars, and recombinant vaccines, including oncolytic vaccines to treat cancer. We also provide products that support the development and commercialization\nof cell and gene therapies. Recombinant vaccines and cell and gene therapies rely on manufacturing of various viral vectors produced using recombinant nucleic acid and cell\nculture technologies. Viral vector manufacturing processes require rigorous analytics, including testing for process-related impurities such as HCPs, host cell DNA, purification\nleachates, growth media additives and enzymes used in viral vector purification processes. Of all process-related impurities, HCPs present the most complex impurity. Per\nregulatory requirements, viral vectors used as a component of CAR-T cell therapies or as gene therapies must be produced in certain cell lines, purified and tested for the\npresence of host cell proteins. All of the 19 existing FDA-and EMA-approved CAR-T Cell and Gene Therapies use Cygnus Host Cell Protein ELISA kits for HCP testing for\ncommercial product lot release. Four of these 19 therapies were approved in 2023.\nELISA is the benchmark method for monitoring levels of process-related impurities during the purification process and in product release testing. The advantages of well-\ndeveloped ELISA kits include the ability to measure very low levels of impurities in the presence of high amounts of drug product, and are readily transferable across an\norganization from process development to manufacturing and quality control bioanalytical groups. Though relatively simple to run, these ELISA kits require a high level of\nexpertise to design, develop and qualify.\nCustomers establishing biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes may use off-the-shelf or generic HCP kits provided by manufacturers like ourselves, or they may choose to\ndesign their own in-house assays for their specific processes. Some customers may choose to use generic assays early in development and migrate to process-specific assays\nlater. The trend in recent years has been for customers to increasingly use generic assays throughout their development and commercialization pathway, relying on our expertise,\nthe established performance of our assays supported by our comprehensive state-of-the-art assay qualification services. If customers choose to develop process-specific assays,\nwe offer custom antibody production and assay development as well as characterization services to meet their needs.\nOur comprehensive catalog of Cygnus Technologies HCP ELISA kits cover 24 expression platforms and provides the specificity and sensitivity to detect impurities with\nreproducibility, which supports regulatory compliance. Our reputation for quality is recognized by the industry and global regulatory agencies, with Cygnus Technologies assays\nused as reference methods throughout the industry and to support manufacturing and quality control of commercialized biologics and gene therapy products.\nOur customers in this segment are biopharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations (“CROs”), contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”)\nand life science companies.\nCygnus Technologies product categories include HCP ELISA kits, other bioprocess impurity and contaminant ELISA kits, viral clearance prediction kits, ancillary reagents and\ncustom services.\n9\nTable of Contents\nHCP ELISA kits. HCP ELISA kits are bioassays used to detect residual proteins from the expression system used in bioproduction. HCPs constitute a major group of process-\nrelated impurities produced using cell culture technology no matter what cell expression platform is used. HCPs pose potential health risks for patients and the risk of failure of\nsafety endpoints for drug manufacturers. When present in the administered product, even at low levels, HCPs can induce an undesired immune response, interfere with drug\nefficacy and impact drug stability. HCPs are a critical quality attribute for biologics safety testing development and must be adequately removed during the downstream\npurification process.\nOther impurity and contaminant kits. Products in this category include kits for measuring Protein A leachate, which results from the affinity purification method used for\nmonoclonal antibody therapeutic agents; ELISA kits for measuring additives in growth media, such as bovine serum albumin; kits for measuring host cell DNA; ELISA kits to\ndetect and quantify residual endonuclease impurities in recombinant viral vector and vaccine preparations: and ELISA kits to quantify residual AAV2, AAV8, AAV9 ligands\nresulting from affinity purification method used for adeno associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies.\nViral Clearance Prediction kits. In 2020, Cygnus Technologies introduced the MockV® Minute Virus of Mice (“MVM”) kit, a novel, proprietary viral clearance prediction tool\nthat includes a non-infectious “mock virus particle” mimicking the physicochemical properties of live virus that may be present endogenously in the drug substance or\nintroduced during bioproduction. The kit enables manufacturers to conduct viral clearance assessments easily and economically and to predict outcomes in-house ahead of\ncostly and logistically challenging live viral clearance studies. In 2022, Cygnus Technologies introduced MockV® RVLP Kit. This kit enables bioprocess scientists to quantify\nthe removal of Retrovirus-like Particles (RVLPs) produced endogenously by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines during biopharmaceutical manufacturing. The kit\nincludes a highly purified and concentrated stock solution of RVLP, an actual non-infectious retrovirus-like contaminant generated during CHO production. In the early 1990s,\nglobal regulatory agencies such as the FDA realized the prevalence of this particle and became concerned about the retroviral safety of CHO-derived biopharmaceuticals. Since\nthen, the biopharmaceutical industry has relied on CROs to propagate Xenotropic Murine Leukemia Virus (XMuLV) as a model retrovirus to demonstrate effective clearance.\nWith the availability of the MockV® RVLP Kit, biopharmaceutical companies can now independently assess the removal of the original retroviral particle of regulatory\nconcern, derived directly from CHO cells.\nAncillary reagents. These products include antibodies, antigens, sample diluents and other auxiliary products necessary to optimize applications for customer processes.\nCustom services. We provide process-specific antibody and ELISA development, qualification and maintenance services. In addition, we have pioneered advanced orthogonal\nmethods including antibody affinity extraction (AAE™) and mass spectrometry for HCP antibodies coverage analysis and HCP identification, which we provide as custom\nservices.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe we are a leader in providing nucleic acid products and services and biologics safety testing products and services to biopharmaceutical customers worldwide. Our\nsuccess is built on the ability of our proprietary technologies and products, provided under exacting quality standards, to reliably serve our customers’ needs for critical raw\nmaterials, and the process innovation, quality, analytical expertise and reliability of our services.\nLeading Supplier of Critical Solutions for Life Sciences from Discovery to Commercialization\nWe seek to be an important component of our customers’ supply chain by providing inputs that are central to the performance of their products and processes throughout the\nproduct lifecycle. By collaborating with customers early in the development phase, our products frequently follow our customers’ development path to commercialization and\nare likely to be incorporated as raw materials in their on-market products and processes. Our decades-long experience and track record, coupled with our ongoing investment in\nfacilities and quality systems, allow our customers to rely on us for their critical products. Our approach is to be a trusted partner throughout the life cycle of our customers’\nproducts.\nInnovation, Proprietary Technologies and Expertise Underpin Our Portfolio\nOur expertise in complex chemistries leads customers to seek our collaboration in designing complex products that meet high performance expectations. Based on the responses\nto the Industry Analysis, we believe the solutions we provide, in many cases, cannot be provided effectively by our competitors. In certain cases, like our CleanCap technology,\nour know-how features differentiated performance characteristics and is backed by intellectual property. In other cases, such as our HCP products, our antibodies are proprietary\nand therefore can only be supplied by us. We believe the proprietary nature of our expertise and products solidifies our long-term customer relationships.\n10\nTable of Contents\nProducts with Outstanding Quality Performance\nWe believe our products stand out when compared to those of our competitors’ because they present innovative solutions to customer needs, as indicated by the responses to the\nIndustry Analysis, while providing reliable performance and quality. CleanCap, for example, offers advantages over competing capping technologies in yield, process\nefficiency, stability and safety. Our oligonucleotides address complex chemistry challenges, which we believe few competitors can address. The results of the Industry Analysis\nindicate that our HCP ELISA kits have defined the market for impurity detection and we believe they have become a de facto standard in biologics safety testing.\nTrusted Brands\nOur TriLink BioTechnologies, Glen Research, Alphazyme and Cygnus Technologies brands are well known in their respective markets for innovation, consistent quality, and\nperformance. This brand recognition has been earned over decades. Our manufacturing processes, quality standards, technical support and high-touch customer service ensure\nthat we maintain the reputation of our brands.\nState-of-the-Art Manufacturing Facilities\nOur biopharmaceutical customers manufacture their products to meet stringent quality standards under strict regulatory guidelines and expect their critical suppliers to meet\ntheir exacting requirements. Our customers further expect that we have the production capacity to meet their needs in a timely manner.\nMaravai has designed and constructed four world-class manufacturing facilities, and since 2022 has expanded the company’s facility footprint by over 95,000 square feet to\nsupport expanded capabilities and future growth.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had invested approximately $93.2 million into our flagship San Diego, California Wateridge facility and its dedicated manufacturing suites to\nproduce materials from Research Use Only (“RUO”) to GMP conditions, along with the required quality systems to meet requirements specified by our customers. This\ninvestment in our Wateridge facility allows us to meet our customers’ demand for our nucleic acid products, including CleanCap.\nIn January 2023, we moved into a new state-of-the-art facility in Leland, North Carolina to increase our manufacturing and development capacity to further support the\nBiologics Safety Testing business.\nIn March 2023, we expanded our San Diego, California manufacturing campus by making a significant investment in additional cleanroom and small molecule manufacturing\nspace, implementing automation systems and adding support areas to augment production capacity with the Flanders 1 facility (“Flanders 1 facility”) for GMP small molecule\nproduction. This facility provides site redundancy for our Wateridge facility and features five GMP suites that can operate in parallel.\nIn June 2023, we finished construction and took occupancy of an additional 32,000 square-foot facility in San Diego (“Flanders 2 facility”) for GMP-grade mRNA\nmanufacturing to support customers progressing into Phase II clinical trials and beyond.\nIn June 2023, we expanded the Alphazyme facility in Jupiter, Florida to add an additional research and development (“R&D”) space to support our specialized enzyme\ndevelopment.\nExperienced Leaders and Talented Workforce\nOur management includes experienced leaders with demonstrated records of success at Maravai and other highly regarded industry participants. They have decades of\ncombined experience and expertise on the forefront of life sciences innovation. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, approximately 24% of our workforce have earned\nadvanced degrees and all receive rigorous on the job training. We believe the quality of our personnel is critical to ensuring the collaborative, long-standing relationships we\nmaintain with many of our customers.\nOur Markets\nWe participate in two distinct market segments: Nucleic Acid Production and Biologics Safety Testing. Our businesses principally address high growth market segments in\nbiopharmaceutical development. In particular, the field of cell and gene therapy has emerged as one of the fastest growing treatment modalities to address a host of human\nconditions.\nBiopharmaceutical customers are increasingly relying on outside parties to provide important raw material inputs and services for their clinical research and manufacturing, a\ndevelopment driving growth for suppliers with unique capabilities, high quality and the ability to manufacture at a relevant scale to support customer programs. We believe that\nsuppliers like ourselves, with\n11\nTable of Contents\nthis rare combination of capabilities, proprietary products and the required investment in manufacturing and quality systems, are benefiting from rapid growth as\nbiopharmaceutical customers seek to partner with a small number of trusted partners.\nIn addition to the continued trend toward outsourcing, several market developments should contribute to long-term growth in our addressable market segments, including:\n• Pivot toward mRNA vaccines and therapeutics for non-COVID indications has been accelerated in part by COVID-19. The first two vaccines approved for use in\ncombating the COVID-19 pandemic were mRNA vaccines, including the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech which uses our CleanCap product. Our CleanCap\nproduct is also incorporated into the booster vaccines developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. The mRNA platforms are gaining prominence as a result of their fast\ndevelopment time, lower relative manufacturing costs and proven safety profile. Pfizer and BioNTech are now developing a combined COVID-19 and Influenza vaccine\nthat has been placed into a designation that can “fast-track” a regulatory decision by the FDA. In addition to the COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA technology is being\ninvestigated for a spectrum of other infectious diseases as well as cancer vaccines, including personalized medicine vaccines. RNA expertise is highly specialized, and\ncustomers seek partners with our expertise to provide these complex products. A small number of providers, like ourselves, with a successful track record for COVID-\n19, can provide this level of RNA capability.\n• Rapid growth in development of cell and gene therapies. Seven new cell and gene therapy approvals (Omisirge, Vyjuvek, Roctavian, Lantidra, Casgevy, Lyfgenia,\nElvidys) were all granted FDA or EMA approval in 2023 and have added clinical credibility to cell and gene therapies. Our internal analysis, supported by third-party\nresearch, projects that by 2027, 20-30% of the mRNA pipeline assets will be for in vivo gene editing and ex vivo gene-edited cell therapies. We support the development\nof cell and gene therapies by providing products used in gene editing and cell therapy research. For example, our host cell protein assays are used during the\nmanufacturing of viral vectors and plasmid DNA. Further, we participate by providing the critical high quality synthetic guide RNA and mRNA that encodes for gene-\nediting enzymes, such as Cas9 that are used in vivo gene editing and ex vivo gene-edited cell therapies.\n• Large and growing pipeline of protein-based therapeutics. In addition to cell and gene therapies, an increase in protein-based therapies is driving the need for\nimpurity testing during process development and manufacturing from our Biologics Safety Testing business. Classical biologics are evolving to be expressed in vivo via\nmRNA. Our analysis suggests that therapeutic proteins and protein replacement may represent as much as 25% of the mRNA pipeline by 2027. We are well positioned\nto leverage our service capabilities and deep understanding of mRNA biology to serve our customers’ needs to express these large, complex, peptide-based molecules.\n12\nTable of Contents\nNucleic Acid Production Market\nThe nucleic acid production market includes the production and synthesis of reagents for research and manufacturing of DNA and RNA-based biologics, including cell and\ngene therapies, mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology approaches.\nThe field of mRNA-based drugs and vaccines has advanced dramatically within a few short years. Providers of technical expertise and manufacturing capabilities, like\nourselves, with the facilities and quality systems demanded by biopharmaceutical customers, benefit from the demand created in the mRNA category.\nBiologics Safety Testing Market\nThe biologics safety testing market includes the detection and clearance of downstream bioprocessing product-related and process-related impurities. We participate in the HCP\nand other process related impurities and viral contamination segments of this market for biopharmaceutical vaccine and therapeutics manufacturing. The growth in this market is\ndriven by continued growth of biologics and biosimilars, viral vector manufacturing for rapidly-growing CAR-T and gene therapy modalities, and increased outsourcing of\nprocess development.\nOur Strategy\nOur customers strive to improve human health. Our goal is to provide them with products and services to accelerate their development efforts, from basic research through\nclinical trials and ultimately to commercialization for therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines.\nSupporting Biopharmaceutical Customers from Discovery Through to Commercialization\nOur customers include both emerging and established biopharmaceutical leaders developing novel drugs, therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines. Emerging biopharmaceutical\ncustomers frequently seek the support we can offer in our state-of-the-art facilities under our stringent quality standards, with the capabilities that result from the capital and\nprocess investments we have made over the last several years. We are capable of manufacturing reagents from research-grade to GMP-grade, which often exceeds the in-house\ncapabilities of our pre-commercial customers. The results of the Industry Analysis indicate that our emerging and established customers also seek us out for our leading\ncapabilities in nucleic acid chemistries and process control assays. We have expertise in complex chemistries, especially in highly modified nucleic acids and mRNA, and we\nbelieve we are a leader in applying these capabilities to the development of vaccines and therapeutics. We further support our customers as they transition from product\ndevelopment to commercialization by providing critical raw materials for their drugs. A core component of our strategy is the continued investment in facilities, quality\nstandards and products and services that allow us to support our customers through the entire life cycle of their drugs.\nDeveloping Proprietary Technologies that Deepen our Relationships with Our Customers\nWe believe we are experts in nucleic acids and our scientists aim to develop proprietary enabling technologies that become integral to our customers’ products. For example,\nCleanCap, our proprietary chemical capping technology, has demonstrated its advantages in terms of the stability of the associated mRNA and its efficiency in protein\nproduction when compared to traditional capping technologies. This efficiency has led biopharmaceutical customers to employ CleanCap in their vaccine and therapeutic\nprograms. As those products proceed through development into commercialization, we believe CleanCap will be a critical input in on-market vaccines and therapeutics.\nForming Long-Term Partnerships for Critical Biopharmaceutical Components and Process Tests\nOur products are frequently incorporated into regulated and highly validated therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes. Our biopharmaceutical customers expect us to\nprovide them with consistent, high-quality products that meet narrow specifications, and that we ensure their supply chain for such products for the length of their programs. In\nmany cases, we may be the sole source of the products we provide. We therefore take seriously our responsibility to our biopharmaceutical partners, and by extension the\npatients they serve. Our emphasis on partnership generally leads to long-term relationships with our customers.\nFocusing Our Efforts on High Growth End Markets\nWhile biopharmaceutical research and in vitro diagnostics markets are experiencing strong growth, we target the highest growth segments within those markets. Our product\nportfolio is well positioned to serve the biologic, cell and gene therapy and mRNA vaccine and therapeutic end markets, which are currently experiencing above-market growth.\nBy investing in technologies at the forefront of biopharmaceutical and in vitro diagnostics, we aim to remain focused on the highest-growth applications.\n13\nTable of Contents\nAcquiring Leading Life Sciences Businesses and Supporting Their Continued Development\nWe built our business by acquiring established and emerging companies with strong scientific foundations in our target markets and investing in their systems, processes and\npeople to accelerate their growth and expand their technologies. Going forward, we may pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe meet, or could meet after being acquired\nand expanded, the following criteria:\n• address our core target markets;\n• have a demonstrated adherence to high quality standards;\n• be leaders in their market niche(s);\n• have differentiated or proprietary products and processes that provide clear value to our biopharmaceutical and other customers; and\n• have a track record of attractive rates of growth and compelling returns on invested capital.\nOur acquisition strategy is to invest significantly in our acquired businesses. We strive to rapidly integrate their quality, human resources, information and financial systems into\nour shared services. All of our companies share a common enterprise resource planning system, and we implement our financial controls and reporting systems soon after\nacquisition. We seek opportunities to invest in their facilities and personnel to provide an operating foundation for growth. We also augment their commercial capabilities\nthrough a combination of sales and marketing resources dedicated to each business, supported by our global marketing infrastructure.\nWe will continue to seek a balance between driving growth organically and inorganically through acquisitions.\nCommercial\nWe have relationships with the following categories of customers: developers of therapeutics and vaccines, other biopharmaceutical and life science research companies,\nacademic institutions and molecular diagnostic companies. Our biopharmaceutical customers include startups, established biotechnology companies and large pharmaceutical\ncompanies developing enzyme replacement therapies, gene editing therapies, ex vivo therapies and vaccines.\nOur commercial function includes direct sales, marketing, customer service, technical support and distributor management. We serve customers through direct sales in each\nbusiness segment, with a primary focus on our biopharmaceutical and large diagnostics and commercial customers. We serve our academic customers via web, email and phone\nordering as well as through key partnerships where our reagent products are included in their mRNA kits. We support all customers with live technical support and customer\nservice.\nWe address customers outside the United States with a combination of direct sales and distributors. We serve many of our biopharmaceutical customers, especially in our\nnucleic acid production segment, via direct sales worldwide. Our distributors also sell our products in over 40 countries and provide customer service and local sales and\nmarketing.\nCompetition\nWe compete with a range of companies across our segments.\nNucleic Acid Production\nWithin nucleic acid production, we compete with four primary types of companies: (1) chemistry companies that create and produce the basic monomers, amidites, and supports\nthat go into the creation of an oligonucleotide; (2) oligonucleotide manufacturers that specialize in custom oligonucleotide development of varying complexities and scales; (3)\nmRNA biotechnology companies that create fully processed mRNA and specialize in custom, complex orders; and (4) CDMOs that have the capability to accept work from\nlarge biopharmaceutical companies and serve as the outsourcing entity for the development and manufacturing of nucleic acid products. However, it is important to note that\nCDMOs seldom offer proprietary products.\nFor mRNA capping analogs, we compete principally with Thermo Fisher Scientific, Aldevron (a subsidiary of Danaher), and New England BioLabs, who offer alternatives to\nCleanCap with enzymatic capping solutions. Many biopharmaceutical companies produce capping solutions in-house using enzymatic or ARCA processes. However, given\nCleanCap’s high yield and process efficiency, many customers who previously insourced these processes have begun to partner with us. Based on the Industry Analysis, we\nbelieve our products and services are more effective than those of our competitors. Deep scientific expertise, intellectual property protection and specialty equipment serve as\nbarriers to entry in this space.\n14\nTable of Contents\nFor our mRNA offerings, we compete with Aldevron, Patheon, eTheRNA, Lonza, Catalent, and Samsung Biologics, among others. Based on the Industry Analysis, we believe\nwe have a reputation for our expertise in the RNA space with talented scientists who are constantly pushing the frontier of RNA science. This scientific expertise and the\nrequired high-cost equipment serve as barriers to entry. In addition to our expertise, we believe our GMP cleanroom manufacturing process differentiates us from competitors.\nFor custom oligonucleotides, we compete with a number of manufacturers. Custom oligonucleotide providers include those that provide complex, highly modified\noligonucleotides and those that provide less complex offerings. In the custom oligonucleotide space, complexity is based on the length of the sequence and level of modification\nto the phosphate backbone. Large manufacturers like Integrated DNA Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific and EMD Millipore Corporation (“Millipore Sigma”) serve less\ncomplex customer needs while we, LGC Biosearch Technologies and GenScript Biotech Corporation serve more complex customer needs. In the custom oligonucleotide\nmarket, we have a reputation for accepting complex orders and delivering high purity products that reduce researcher re-work and save money. Quick turnaround times and the\nability to produce at scale are essential requirements in this segment.\nIn the oligonucleotide synthesis inputs market, we compete against large distributor-manufacturers like Thermo Fisher and Millipore Sigma while also serving them as\ncustomers. Our Glen Research brand has a long history in this industry, which drives customer loyalty, and has a reputation for high-fidelity technical service, focusing on\nsupplying and sourcing highly modified inputs for its customers.\nFor our specialty enzymes offering, we compete with New England Biolabs, Thermo Fisher, QIAGEN, and Roche, among others. We believe that Alphazyme is uniquely\npositioned in the market to address customers’ custom enzyme needs and has a reputation of being a flexible partner.\nBiologics Safety Testing\nFor drugs in early development, we compete against other bioprocess impurity kit providers such as BioGenes (“BioGenes”) or Enzo Life Sciences (“Enzo”). Competitors\ngenerally offer fewer expression platforms (generally between one and three) compared to our offering of 24 expression platforms and over 100 different impurity detection\nkits. As a drug successfully moves forward to validation and approval stages, a customer may either continue with an off-the-shelf kit or they may begin the process to develop\na custom assay that is tailored to meet their specific host cell and manufacturing process needs. During the entire drug development process, and especially during this decision,\nwe are partners with the manufacturer and provide our expertise to help them make the best bioprocess quality control and testing-related decisions.\nIf a drug manufacturer continues with an off-the-shelf assay from development to validation and approval, they will generally stay with the incumbent kit provider due to the\nextensive validation they have conducted. For custom assay development, our main competitors are BioGenes, Rockland Immunochemicals and some CDMOs and CROs with\ncustom assay development capabilities. The trend in recent years has been for CDMOs, CROs and large biopharmaceutical companies to focus on core competencies and\noutsource host cell protein assays or qualify off-the-shelf kits when possible.\nLicenses and Collaborations\nBroad Patent License Agreement\nWe (through TriLink BioTechnologies) entered into a Nonexclusive Patent License and Material Transfer Agreement with The Broad Institute, Inc. (“Broad”) effective as of\nJuly 5, 2017, and amended on September 29, 2017 (the “Broad Patent License Agreement”). Broad, together with a consortium of educational institutions (including Harvard\nUniversity and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), owns and controls certain patent rights relating to genome editing technology, including the CRISPR-Cas9 gene\nediting processes and have a licensing program for use and commercialization of technologies and products covered by the underlying patent rights. Under the Broad Patent\nLicense Agreement, Broad grants to us a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable and non-sublicensable, worldwide license under the licensed patent rights to\nmanufacture and sell products and to perform certain in vitro processes or services on a fee-for-service basis, in each case, solely as research tools for research purposes\n(excluding human, clinical or diagnostic uses). We must use diligent efforts to develop products, introduce products into the commercial market and make products reasonably\navailable to the public. We are obligated to pay a mid-five figure annual license maintenance fee and royalties in the range of 5% to 10% on net sales of covered products and\nprocesses.\nThe term of the Broad Patent License Agreement extends through the expiration of the last to expire claim of any of the licensed patents. We are entitled to terminate the Broad\nPatent License Agreement for convenience at any time on at least three (3) months written notice, in which case we must continue to pay license maintenance fees and royalties\nas noted above for the sale of products that are not covered by the specific claims of the licensed patent rights but are otherwise derived from such\n15\nTable of Contents\nlicensed patent rights or from products covered by such licensed patent rights. Broad may terminate the license for our uncured failure to make payments, for our uncured\nmaterial breach or if we bring a patent challenge against any of the institutional rights holders.\nManufacturing and Supply\nWe occupy facilities in San Diego, California, Leland, North Carolina, Sterling, Virginia, and Jupiter, Florida.\nOur Wateridge facility in San Diego is engaged in the manufacture of reagents. The facility was designed and built by us in conjunction with the building owner to contain fully\nfunctional chemical and biological manufacturing operations from material receiving to product distribution and has its own loading dock, manufacturing gas delivery system,\nsolvent delivery and waste system, ISO Class 8 and ISO Class 7 designated customer manufacturing suites and integrated building management systems for required site\ncontrol.\nIn addition to the Wateridge facility, we have two facilities in San Diego, Flanders 1 and Flanders 2. Flanders 1 provides us with additional GMP manufacturing capacity and\nprovides us the optionality downstream to manufacture materials beyond current quality requirements for mRNA raw materials, including CleanCap. Flanders 1 will also\nsupport an additional increase to batch run sizes and overall throughput. Flanders 2 was purpose built to support GMP-grade manufacturing and to support customers into Phase\nII clinical trials and beyond. Both the Flanders 1 and Flanders 2 facilities include the introduction of integrated manufacturing systems, quality of water improvements from\nReverse Osmosis De-ionized grade water to WFI (“Water For Injection”), which is pharmaceutical grade water, and other facility infrastructure investments to support potential\ncustomer needs related to quality. We took occupancy of the Flanders facilities in 2023 and expect to begin manufacturing from both locations in 2024.\nIn early 2023, our Southport, North Carolina operations were relocated to a new state-of-the-art facility in Leland, North Carolina. This new facility more than doubles our\noperational square footage and has capacity to support future growth in the manufacture and processing of antibody and HCP ELISA kits. The operations include laboratory,\nmanufacturing, kitting, cold storage, shipping and waste handling capabilities. The fully customized design includes a Mass Spectrometry Center of Excellence and specialized\ncell culture facilities. It significantly increases our manufacturing and development capacity while providing other R&D, laboratory and automation upgrades. Extensive process\nflow analysis has been incorporated into the facility design to optimize and enhance both our manufacturing and kit packaging operations.\nOur Sterling, Virginia facility was designed to perform quality control, aliquoting, packaging and shipping and houses the appropriate space and systems.\nThrough our acquisition of Alphazyme in the first quarter of 2023, we acquired a purpose-built enzyme production facility in Jupiter, Florida, that can produce enzymes to\nkilogram quantities. The facility includes environmental controls such as HEPA filtration, pressure, temperature, and humidity monitoring, with vertical integration of all\nenzyme development, production, and testing operations. Our enzymes are produced under the controls of an ISO 13485:2016 compliant QMS.\nOur supply chain is supported by a diverse network of specialized suppliers and transportation partners and undergoes regular evaluations to assess supplier quality and identify\nrisks, including those associated with supply concentration. These proactive evaluations enable us to implement strategic measures to effectively manage and mitigate risks. By\ncontinuously optimizing our supply chain, we ensure operational resilience and maintain a steady supply of critical materials for our products.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe provide products used for basic research or as raw materials used by biopharmaceutical customers for further processing, and active pharmaceutical ingredients used for\npreclinical and clinical studies. The quality of our products is critical to researchers looking to develop novel vaccines and therapies and for biopharmaceutical customers who\nuse our products as raw materials or who are engaged in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Biopharmaceutical customers are subject to extensive regulations by the FDA and\nsimilar regulatory authorities in other countries for conducting clinical trials and commercializing products for therapeutic, vaccine or diagnostic use. This regulatory scrutiny\nresults in our customers imposing rigorous quality requirements on us as their supplier through supplier qualification processes and customer contracts.\nOur nucleic acid and biologics safety testing segments produce materials used in research and biopharmaceutical production, clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support\nproducts. We produce materials in support of our customers’ manufacturing businesses and to fulfill their validation requirements, as applicable. These customer activities are\nsubject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the FDA and other national regulatory agencies under their respective cGMP regulations.\nThese regulations result in our customers imposing quality requirements on us for the manufacture of our products, and maintain records of our manufacturing, testing and\ncontrol activities. In addition, the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture, distribution and/or marketing of\nparticular products.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAll of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation, as appropriate under federal, state and local laws relating to:\n• the surface and air transportation of chemicals, biological reagents and hazardous materials;\n• the handling, use, storage and disposal of chemicals (including toxic substances), biological reagents and hazardous waste;\n• the procurement, handling, use, storage and disposal of biological products for research purposes;\n• the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities; and\n• protection of the environment and general public.\nRegulatory compliance programs at each of our businesses are managed by a dedicated group responsible for regulatory affairs and compliance, including the use of outside\nconsultants. Our compliance programs are also managed by quality management systems, such as vendor supplier programs and training programs. Within each business, we\nhave established Quality Management Systems (“QMS”) responsible for risk based internal audit programs to manage regulatory requirements and client quality expectations.\nOur QMS program ensures that management has proper oversight of regulatory compliance and quality assurance, inclusive of reviews of our system practices to ensure that\nappropriate quality controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance and quality assurance.\nResearch Products\nOur products and operations may be subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, or local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory\nauthorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, clearance, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising,\npromotion, marketing, distribution, post-market monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical drugs. Certain of our products are currently marketed as\nresearch use only (“RUO”).\nWe believe that our products that are marketed as RUO products are exempt from compliance with GMP regulations under the FDCA. RUO products cannot make any claims\nrelated to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on\nproducts labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product. The FDA will also\nevaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if the product is intended for diagnostic purposes. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances,\nthat our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical products that will require clearance or approval prior\nto commercialization.\nWe do not make claims related to safety or effectiveness and they are not intended for diagnostic or clinical use. However, the quality of our products is critical to meeting\ncustomer needs, and we therefore voluntarily follow the quality standards outlined by the International Organization for Standardization for quality management systems (ISO\n9001:2015) for the design, development, manufacture, and distribution of our products. Some biopharmaceutical customers desire extra requirements including quality\nparameters and product specifications, which are outlined in customer-specific quality agreements. These products are further processed and validated by customers for their\napplications. Customers qualify us as part of their quality system requirements, which can include a supplier questionnaire and on-site audits. Customers requalify us on a\nregular basis to ensure our quality system, processes and facilities continue to meet their needs and we are meeting requirements outlined in relevant customer agreements.\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) for Clinical Trials\nWe provide APIs to customers for use in preclinical studies through and including clinical trials. We hold a drug manufacturing license with the California Food and Drug\nBranch of the California Department of Public Health for manufacture of APIs for clinical use and are subject to inspection to maintain licensure. Manufacture of APIs for use\nin clinical trials is regulated under § 501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, but is not subject to the current GMP regulations in 21 CFR § 211 by operation of 21 CFR § 210. We follow the\nprinciples detailed in the International Council for Harmonisation (“ICH”) Q7, Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (Section 19, APIs For\nUse in Clinical Trials) in order to comply with the applicable requirements of the FDCA, and the comparable GMP principles for Europe; European Community, Part II, Basic\nRequirements for Active Substances Used as Starting Materials (Section 19, APIs For Use in Clinical Trials). APIs are provided to customers under customer contracts that\noutline quality standards and product specifications. As products advance through the clinical phases, requirements become more stringent, and we work with customers to\ndefine and agree on requirements and risks associated with their product.\n17\nTable of Contents\nCustomers’ biopharmaceutical products early in their development have a high failure rate and often do not advance through the clinical stages to commercialization. Our\ncustomers are required to follow regulatory pathways that are not always known, which may cause additional unforeseen requirements placed on us as their contract\nmanufacturer and delays in advancing to the next stage of product development. We also provide novel compounds for cell and gene therapy applications, which result in\nadditional challenges for our customers attempting to obtain regulatory approval given that this field is relatively new, and regulations are evolving. Customer clinical trials rely\non approval from institutional review boards (“IRBs”) and patient and volunteer enrollment, which makes timelines unpredictable for advancing to the next stage in product\ndevelopment. Preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by our customers are also expensive and data may be negative or inconclusive causing customers to abandon\nprojects that were expected to continue. Regulatory requirements in both the United States and abroad are always evolving and compliance with future laws may require\nsignificant investment to ensure compliance.\nOther Regulatory Requirements\nEnvironmental laws and regulations. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental\nprotection. To date, there have been no material effects upon our earnings or competitive position resulting from our compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or\nadopted relating to the protection of the environment. Our capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2023 and 2022 were not material and are not expected to be\nmaterial in 2024.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and services, defend and enforce our intellectual property\nrights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights\nof others. We seek to protect the investments made into the development of our products and services by relying on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade\nsecrets, including know-how, and license agreements. We also seek to protect our proprietary products and services, in part, by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors\nand other third parties to execute confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements.\nPatents. Our intellectual property strategy is focused on protecting through patents and other intellectual property rights our core products and services, including CleanCap,\nand related instrumentation and applications. In addition, we protect our ongoing research and development into critical reagents for cell and gene therapy through patents and\nother intellectual property rights. Our patent portfolio generally includes patents and patent applications relating to compositions and methods for the production of CleanCap,\noligonucleotides, nucleic acids, immunofluorescence assays, and mock viral particles. We may own provisional patent applications, and provisional patent applications are not\neligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file national stage patent applications either directly or via the PCT within 12 or 30 to 32 months, respectively. If\nwe do not timely file any national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the\ninventions disclosed in such provisional patent applications. We cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with\nany competitive advantage.\nIssued patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in\nwhich they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications are granted a term of 21 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent\napplication. Issued patents may be extended beyond the natural 21 year term for regulatory or administrative delay in accordance with provisions of applicable local law. As a\nresult, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe following granted patents relate to our CleanCap products and technology.\nJurisdiction Patent Number Title Expiration\nUnited States 10494399 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nUnited States 10519189 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nUnited States 10913768C1 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nUnited States 11414453 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nUnited States 11878991 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nUnited States 11578095 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nEurope 3352584 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nEurope 3954225 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nEurope 3906789 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nEurope 4104687 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nEurope 4140491 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nAustralia 2016328645 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nAustralia 2021206780 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nCanada 2999274 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nChina ZL 202310734863.0 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nHong Kong 40080484 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nJapan 6814997 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nJapan 7082174 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nKorea, Republic of 10-2500198 Compositions and methods for synthesizing 5′-Capped RNAs 2036\nThe following patents relate to our MockV related products and technology.\nJurisdiction Patent Number Title Expiration\nMethods for evaluating viral clearance from a biopharmaceutical solution\nUnited States 9632087 2034\nemploying mock viral particles\nMethods for evaluating viral clearance from a process solution employing mock\nUnited States 10309963 2034\nviral particles\nMethods and kits for quantifying the removal of mock virus particles from a\nEurope 3044339 2034\npurified solution\nMethods and kits for quantifying the removal of Mock Virus Particles from a\nAustralia 2014320015 2034\npurified solution\nMethods and kits for quantifying the removal of Mock Virus Particles from a\nAustralia 2021200484 2034\npurified solution\nMethods and kits for quantifying pseudoviral particles removed from purified\nChina 105899684 2034\nsolution\nJapan 6549126 Methods and kits for removal of mock virus particles from a purified solution 2034\nUnited States 11754565 Methods and kits for removal of mock virus particles from a purified solution 2034\nTrademarks. Our trademark portfolio is designed to protect the brands of our current and future products and includes U.S. trademark registrations for our company name,\nMaravai LifeSciences, subsidiary names Cygnus Technologies and TriLink Biotechnologies and various product names, such as CleanCap and MockV.\nTrade Secrets. We also rely on trade secrets, including know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to strengthen our competitive position. We have\ndetermined that certain technologies, such as the production of antibodies for biologics safety testing, are better kept as trade secrets, rather than pursuing patent protection. To\nprevent disclosure of trade secrets to others, it is our policy to enter into nondisclosure, invention assignment and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to\ntrade secrets, such as our employees, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors\n19\nTable of Contents\nand other third parties. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the\nperiod of employment or assignment, as applicable, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security\nmeasures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no\nassurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or provide any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from\nour pending or any future patent applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or technology. Our intellectual property rights may be invalidated,\nheld unenforceable, circumvented, narrowed or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed may not protect our intellectual\nproperty rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Furthermore, it may be difficult to protect our trade secrets. While we have confidence in the measures we take to\nprotect and preserve our trade secrets, they may be inadequate and can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for violations of such measures. In addition, our\ntrade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Moreover, our invention assignment agreements with employees, collaborators,\noutside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties may not be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection for our intellectual property\nrights. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties, including our competitors, may be able to use our technologies to produce and market products\nthat compete with us and erode our competitive advantage.

Following the reduction in force, which was completed on January 5, 2024, we had approximately 570\nfull-time employees. Our workforce represents a diversity of backgrounds, with 44% identifying as female, 56% as male, and 52% as ethnically or racially diverse as of\nDecember 31, 2023. We take pride in the fact that, as of December 31, 2023, 24% of our team held advanced degrees, underscoring our emphasis on science and innovation.\nOur compensation and comprehensive benefits packages are designed to attract and retain the talent we need to be competitive in the markets we serve. Believing in the value of\nownership, we extend equity awards to all full-time employees through our 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan, alongside opportunities to participate in our 2020 Employee Stock\nPurchase Plan. Our commitment to excellence ensures every employee receives thorough on-the-job training. We also understand that great people managers are the key to\nenabling and unlocking the potential of our employees. In 2023, we initiated a bi-monthly “Leading Together” people leader series with all levels of our people leaders to\nensure they had the critical knowledge, perspective, and tools to develop their people and align their teams towards company goals and objectives.\nWe actively work to foster direct and open lines of communication between all levels of staff through our all-employee engagement survey, our quarterly all-employee town\nhalls, management skip level meetings, and an emphasis on our core values (Connected, Open, Driven, and Empowered). Our 2023 company-wide engagement survey reached\na participation rate of 97% and all levels of leadership engage in action planning based on the results.\nIn 2023, all of our sites participated in process excellence initiatives and we launched “Find a Better Way Day” to highlight the efforts of our employees to drive quality and\nsafety improvements and reduce cost.\nAs a leading life sciences company, we are committed to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. All employees that could be exposed to potential hazards are\nrequired to complete annual health and safety training, including laboratory chemical safety, hazard communication and hazardous waste management trainings. In 2023, we\nupgraded our electronic Safety Data Sheet (SDS) system to more readily provide chemical safety data electronically to employees and customers.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.maravai.com, and our investor relations website is located at investors.maravai.com.

Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following\nrisks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our Class A common\nstock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the material risks we and/or our shareholders face in the normal course of our business operations. The list below is not exhaustive, and is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full risk factor discussion that follows this summary.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\n• The level of our customers’ spending on and demand for outsourced nucleic acid production and biologics safety testing products and services.\n• Uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of our revenue associated with COVID-19-related products and services and the dependency of such revenue, in important\nrespects, on factors outside our control.\n• The impact of ongoing macroeconomic challenges and changes in economic conditions, including adverse developments affecting banks and financial institutions,\nfollow-on effects of those events and related systemic pressures, on our and our customers’ current and future business operations.\n• The effects of our recent reduction in force, including on our ability to attract and/or retain qualified key personnel.\n• Use of our products by customers in the production of vaccines and therapies, some of which represent relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment, and the\nimpact of unforeseen adverse events, negative clinical outcomes, development of alternative therapies, or increased regulatory scrutiny of these modes of treatment and\ntheir financial cost on our customers’ use of our products and services.\n• Competition with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are substantially larger than us and potentially capable of developing new approaches\nthat could make our products, services and technology obsolete.\n• The potential failure of our products and services to not perform as expected and the reliability of the technology on which our products and services are based.\n• The risk that our products do not comply with required quality standards.\n• Market acceptance of our life science reagents.\n• Significant fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results, which make our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our\noperating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide.\n• Our ability to implement our strategic plan successfully.\n• Natural disasters, geopolitical instability (including the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip) and other catastrophic events.\n• Risks related to our acquisitions, including whether we achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of businesses or technologies.\n• Product liability lawsuits.\n• Our dependency on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue and our ability to maintain our current relationships with such customers.\n• Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of our raw materials and the risk that we may not be able to find replacements or\nimmediately transition to alternative suppliers.\n• The risk that our products become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in the future.\n22\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology\n• Our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce sufficient intellectual property protection for our current or future products.\n• The risk that a future cyber-attack or security breach cannot be prevented.\n• Our ability to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information\n• The risk that one of our products may be alleged (or found) to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\n• Compliance with our obligations under intellectual property license agreements.\n• Our or our licensors’ failure to maintain the patents or patent applications in-licensed from a third party.\n• Our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n• Our existing level of indebtedness and our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\n• Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness.\n• Our potential failure to meet our debt service obligations.\n• Restrictions on our current and future operations under the terms applicable to the Credit Agreement.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\n• Our dependence, by virtue of our principal asset being our interest in Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC (“Topco LLC”), on distributions from Topco LLC to pay our taxes\nand expenses, including payments under a tax receivable agreement with the former owners of Topco LLC (the “Tax Receivable Agreement” or “TRA”) together with\nvarious limitations and restrictions that impact Topco LLC’s ability to make such distributions.\n• The risk that conflicts of interest could arise between our shareholders and Maravai Life Sciences Holdings, LLC (“MLSH 1”), the only other member of Topco LLC,\nand impede business decisions that could benefit our shareholders.\n• The substantial future cash payments we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement to MLSH 1 and Maravai Life Sciences Holdings 2, LLC\n(“MLSH 2”), an entity through which certain of our former owners hold their interests in the Company and the negative effect of such payments.\n• The fact that our organizational structure, including the TRA, confers certain benefits upon MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 that will not benefit our other common shareholders to\nthe same extent as they will benefit MLSH 1 and MLSH 2.\n• Our ability to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the tax attributes covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement.\n• The possibility that we will receive distributions from Topco LLC significantly in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make to make payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement.\n• Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\n• Risks related to our annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including the potential existence of any material weakness or\nsignificant deficiency.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\n• The fact that investment entities affiliated with GTCR, LLC (“GTCR”) currently control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, and it may\nhave interests that conflict with ours or yours in the future.\n• Risks related to our “controlled company” status within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ.\n• The potential anti-takeover effects of certain provisions in our corporate organizational documents.\n• Potential sales of a significant portion of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock.\n23\nTable of Contents\n• Potential preferred stock issuance and the anti-takeover impacts of any such issuances.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe are dependent on the level of our customers’ spending on and demand for outsourced nucleic acid production and biologics safety testing products and services. A\nreduction in spending or change in spending priorities of our customers could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe success of our business depends primarily on the number and size of contracts with our customers, primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for our products\nand services. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic we benefited from a significant increase in demand for our products and service, including our proprietary\nCleanCap® analogs that are used by our customers in the production of COVID-19 vaccines, and also benefited during 2021 and 2022, more generally, from the overall growth\nof the global biologics market, higher research and development budgets of our customers and a greater degree of outsourcing by our customers. The level of our customers’\nspending on and demand for our products and services is also subject to, among other things, their own financial performance, changes in their available resources, the timing of\ntheir commercial manufacturing initiatives, their decisions to acquire in-house manufacturing capacity (rather than outsource), their spending priorities, including research and\ndevelopment budgets, and their budgetary policies and practices, which, in turn, are dependent upon a number of factors outside of our control.\nOur customers determine their research and development budgets based on several factors, including their need to develop new biological products, their competitors’\ndiscoveries, developments and commercial manufacturing initiatives and the anticipated market, clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic\nareas. In addition, consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on our customers’ spending as they integrate acquired operations,\nincluding research and development departments and associated budgets.\nAccess to capital is critical to many of our customers’ ability to fund research and development, particularly early-stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and\nhistorically, these companies have funded their research and development activities by raising capital privately or in the equity markets. Declines and uncertainties in the capital\nmarkets, including as a result of ongoing negative macroeconomic challenges, rising interest rates, recent instability in the banking sector, and volatile credit markets, have\nlimited access to capital and negatively affected companies’ ability to fund research and development efforts. While 2021 and 2022 saw a significant level of investment in\nventure- and private equity-backed startup companies, funding for companies at all stages, and particularly early- and late-stage companies, contracted considerably during\n2023, which, together with broader economic uncertainty, led certain of our customers to implement more stringent budgetary policies designed to conserve capital, which in\nturn, caused a reduction in research and development spending and a decline in further purchases of our products and services. We have no assurance as to whether, or when,\nsuch research and development spending may stabilize or increase, if at all. Further, if the funding of venture- and private equity-backed biotechnology and pharmaceutical\ncompanies remains weak or weakens further, the research and development budgets of our customers may be further reduced or eliminated altogether, which could impact\nfuture demand for our products and services.\nIf our customers reduce their spending on our products and services as a result of any of these or other factors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nMoreover, we have no control over the timing and volume of purchases by our customers, and as a result, our operating results may fluctuate significantly, and our future\nrevenue and operating results can be difficult to forecast. Our inability to forecast fluctuations in demand could harm our business, financial position and future results of\noperations. See also “—Our operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our\noperating results to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide” below.\nThe extent and duration of our revenue associated with COVID-19 related products and services are uncertain and are dependent, in important respects, on factors outside\nour control.\nCertain of our products, including our proprietary CleanCap® analogs, are used by our customers in the production of COVID-19 vaccines. During each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our results of operations and cash flows were significantly and positively impacted by a strong demand for our proprietary CleanCap®\nanalogs and highly modified RNA products, particularly mRNA. However, as a result of the general decrease in market demand for COVID-19 related products and services,\nincluding the supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and in particular, following the end of U.S. federal public health emergency declaration and World Health\nOrganization declaration of the end of the pandemic in early May 2022, we experienced substantial declines in COVID-19 related revenue during the year ended December 31,\n2023. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we estimate that revenue from COVID-19 related products and services represented approximately 21.0%,\n67.9% and 69.7%, respectively, of our total revenues. We expect to experience\n24\nTable of Contents\nfurther declines in COVID-19 related revenue for the aforementioned reasons, as well as a result of unused inventory of our products that our customers have on hand, which\nare not indication-specific. We are currently unable to fully estimate the impact of this unused inventory on our future revenues, nor are we able to predict when or if our\ncustomers will resume purchasing COVID-19 related products. Our longer-term revenue prospects for COVID-19 related products are highly uncertain but are expected to be\nsubstantially less than pandemic highs. Additionally, the ongoing manufacture and supply of COVID-19 vaccines (including bivalent booster doses) by our customers is\nuncertain and subject to various political, social, economic, and regulatory factors that are outside of our control, including the emergence, duration and intensity of new virus\nvariants; regional resurgences of the virus globally; the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations, vaccine supply constraints, vaccine hesitancy and\nthe effectiveness of vaccines against new virus strains; competition faced by our customers from other COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers and the development and availability\nof antiviral therapeutic alternatives; the lapsing of the public health emergency declaration made pursuant to Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act in January 2020 with\nrespect to the COVID-19 pandemic; political and social debate relating to the need for, efficacy of, or side effects related to one or more specific COVID-19 vaccines; and the\nU.S. economy and global economy, including impacts resulting from supply chain constraints, labor market shortages and inflationary pressures. As the supply and manufacture\nof COVID-19 vaccines by our customers slows, or becomes no longer necessary, including if COVID-19 vaccines by our customers’ competitors are determined or perceived to\nbe more effective, we expect that demand for our COVID-19 related products and services will significantly decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our\nrevenue, results of operations and financial condition.\nOngoing macroeconomic challenges and changes in economic conditions, including adverse developments affecting banks and financial institutions, follow-on effects of\nthose events and related systemic pressures, could negatively impact, directly or indirectly, our and our customers’ current and future business operations and our financial\ncondition, revenue and earnings.\nOur reagents are sold primarily to biopharmaceutical and academic organizations developing novel vaccines and therapies and performing basic research. Research and\ndevelopment spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology companies, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. Our biologics safety testing customers are\nbiopharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations (“CROs”), contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) and life science companies, which\nlargely serve the biopharmaceutical industry. Our nucleic acid production customers are largely vaccine and therapeutic drug makers or diagnostics manufacturers, which rely in\npart on government healthcare-related policies and funding. As a result, changes in government funding for certain research, decreases in or the imposition of limits on\ngovernment spending more generally (including as a result of the ongoing appropriations process for the US. federal government’s fiscal year 2024), or reductions in overall\nhealthcare spending could negatively impact us or our customers and, correspondingly, our sales to them. In particular, if the U.S. Congress fails to pass appropriate\nappropriations measures or enact another continuing resolution, reimbursements we are eligible to receive under the Cooperative Agreement we entered into with the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense may be jeopardized, which would negatively affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nCurrently, the U.S. and global economies are experiencing ongoing macroeconomic challenges, including labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and persistent inflation,\nwhich have led to increasing interest rates, volatility in the capital and credit markets, and fiscal and monetary policy uncertainty. Our business operations, as well as our\ncustomers’ and suppliers’ business operations, have been impacted, and are expected to continue to be impacted, by these negative conditions. In particular, labor shortages and\nwage inflation have affected our ability to hire, develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce, to maintain performance levels (especially cost and schedule), and to\nmaintain our corporate culture. Further, if our raw material and other laboratory material suppliers experience operational challenges as a result of labor shortages, limited\nmaterial availability, logistics delays and transportation capacity constraints, or are unable to access adequate capital to support their working capital requirements, they may be\nunable to provide raw materials or other laboratory materials to us in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost, which could adversely affect our profit margins and results of\noperations.\nAdditionally, demand for our products and services could be adversely impacted if these ongoing macroeconomic challenges cause customers to reduce their operating budgets,\nadversely impact our customers’ ability to commit funds to purchase our products, or otherwise cause customers to delay, cancel, decrease or forego purchases of our products\nand services. Further, since the majority of our customers’ contracts can be terminated, delayed or reduced in scope upon short notice or no notice, this may require us to carry\nexcess inventory to manage through unevenness in order activity and lead to unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly revenue and earnings. If we are not able to forecast and\nadequately manage through changes in our customers’ order requirements, our productivity, profitability, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be\nnegatively impacted. Further deterioration or a protracted extension of these negative macroeconomic conditions, a potential economic downturn or recession, or a significant\nreduction or delay in governmental funding as a result of U.S. federal budget\n25\nTable of Contents\nissues, or the perception that any of these events may occur, could cause a decline in demand for our products and services and adversely affect our performance and result in\ndeclines in our revenue and earnings.\nOur recent reduction in force may have unintended consequences, including business disruption, cause us to experience difficulties attracting and/or retaining qualified\nkey personnel, which could negatively impact our ability to develop and market our products and services and our overall performance.\nOn November 7, 2023, we announced a workforce reduction of approximately 15% of our total full-time workforce (the “Reduction in Force”). The Reduction in Force resulted\nin the elimination of 102 full-time positions. Although the majority of the positions eliminated were intended to address excess manufacturing capacity, relative to current\ndemand, this reduction has resulted in certain reallocations of employee duties. As a result, inefficiencies related to task unfamiliarity, heavier workloads, loss of knowledge and\nunfilled gaps may arise, especially if we are unable to effectively manage and implement the transition of impacted employees’ duties and responsibilities. Any such\ninefficiencies may cause disruption or delay in our business activities. The Reduction in Force and resulting job reassignments could also negatively affect employee morale and\nmake it more difficult to motivate and retain our remaining personnel.\nIn addition, our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our management and scientific staff and our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled\ntechnical, scientific, management and marketing personnel, who deliver high-quality and timely services to our customers and keep pace with cutting-edge technologies and\ndevelopments in biologics. We face significant competition in the hiring and retention of such personnel from other companies, other providers of outsourced biologics services,\nresearch and academic institutions, government and other organizations who have superior funding and resources and who may use these resources to pursue personnel more\naggressively than we are. Additionally, certain highly skilled personnel that we seek to employ may be subject to non-competition or other restrictive covenants restricting their\nability to work for us or within certain aspects of our business for a period of time. Although some jurisdictions (including the State of California) prohibit non-competition\nagreements as a matter of law, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would prohibit employers in the U.S. from using non-\ncompete agreements, if we hire certain employees from competitors or other companies, those former employers may attempt to assert that these employees and/or we have\nbreached certain legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources.\nWe have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. In recent years,\nrecruiting, hiring and retaining employees with expertise in our industry and in the geographies where we operate has become increasingly difficult as the demand for skilled\nprofessionals has increased and as a result of labor shortages believed to have resulted from actions taken during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but which remained\nfollowing the recovery and which we expect will continue beyond the near-term. These difficulties may be heightened as a result of the Reduction in Force. The loss of key\npersonnel or our inability to hire and retain skilled personnel could materially adversely affect the development of our products and services and our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nCertain of our products are used by customers in the production of vaccines and therapies, some of which represent relatively new and still-developing modes of treatment.\nUnforeseen adverse events, negative clinical outcomes, or increased regulatory scrutiny of these and their financial cost may damage public perception of the safety, utility,\nor efficacy of these vaccines and therapies or other modes of treatment and may harm our customers’ ability to conduct their business. Such events may negatively impact\nour revenue and have an adverse effect on our performance.\nGene therapy and nucleic acid vaccines remain relatively new and are under active development, with only a few gene therapies and nucleic acid vaccines, including those for\nCOVID-19, approved to date by regulatory authorities. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy or nucleic acid vaccines are unsafe or ineffective, and\ngene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. Following the release of nucleic acid COVID-19 vaccines, including those that incorporate\nour CleanCap® products, segments of the population have criticized their safety and efficacy impacting vaccine demand. In addition, ethical, social, legal and financial\nconcerns about gene therapy and nucleic acid vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, could result in additional regulations or limitations or even prohibitions on certain gene\ntherapies or vaccine-related products. Our customers’ use of our products and services in therapeutic and vaccine development programs for other (non-COVID-19-related)\nindications could be impacted by more restrictive regulations or negative public perception, which could negatively affect our business prospects, revenue and results of\noperation.\nWe compete with life science, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are substantially larger than we are and potentially capable of developing new approaches\nthat could make our products, services and technology obsolete.\nThe market for pharmaceutical, reagent, therapeutic and diagnostic products and services is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving, significantly affected by new product\nintroductions and other market activities by industry participants and subject to rapid technological change. We also expect increased competition as additional companies enter\nour market and as more\n26\nTable of Contents\nadvanced technologies become available. We compete with other providers of outsourced biologics products and services. We also compete with the in-house discovery,\ndevelopment and commercial manufacturing functions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with\nsignificantly greater resources and market share than we have. As a consequence, these competitors are able to spend more aggressively on product and service development,\nmarketing, sales and other initiatives than we can. Many of these competitors also have:\n• broader name recognition;\n• longer operating histories and the benefits derived from greater economies of scale;\n• larger and more established distribution networks;\n• additional product and service lines and the ability to bundle products and services to offer higher discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;\n• more experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing and marketing;\n• more experience in entering into collaborations or other strategic partnership arrangements; and\n• more financial, manufacturing and human resources to support product development, sales and marketing and patent and other intellectual property litigation.\nThese factors, among others, may enable our competitors to market their products and services at lower prices or on terms more advantageous to customers than we can offer.\nCompetition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Additionally, our current and future competitors, including certain of our customers, may at any time develop\nadditional products and services that compete with our products and services and new approaches by these competitors may make our products, services, technologies and\nmethodologies obsolete or noncompetitive. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations.\nIn addition, to develop and market our new products, services, technologies and methodologies successfully, we must accurately assess and meet customers’ needs, make\nsignificant capital expenditures, optimize our development and manufacturing processes to predict and control costs, hire, train and retain the necessary personnel, increase\ncustomer awareness and acceptance of our services, provide high-quality services in a timely manner, price our products and services competitively and effectively integrate\ncustomer feedback into our business planning. If we fail to create demand for our new products, services or technologies, our future business could be harmed.\nIf our products and services do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products and services are based is questioned, we could experience\nlost revenue, delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products and services, increased costs and damage to our reputation.\nOur success depends on the market’s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality life science reagents. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be\nparticularly sensitive to product defects and errors. Our reputation and the public image of our products, services and technologies may be impaired if our products or services\nfail to perform as expected.\nAlthough our products are tested prior to shipment, defects or errors could nonetheless occur. Our operating results depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary,\nimprove our quality management strategy and systems and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. A failure of our\nquality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons,\nincluding equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of,\nmanufacturing operations. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of\nfacility production altogether. Furthermore, some of the products that we manufacture are subsequently incorporated into products that are sold by other life sciences companies\nand we have no control over the manufacture and production of those products.\nIn addition, in the event we, or our suppliers, fail to meet required quality standards and if our products experience, or are perceived to experience, a material defect or error, our\nproducts could be recalled or we may be unable to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. In the past,\ncertain of our custom mRNA and CleanCap® reagent products have been sold with insufficient capping efficiency or with incorrect transcription instructions. Additionally,\nseveral lots of our host cell protein (“HCP”) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (“ELISA”) biologics safety testing kits have experienced a possible instability drift and\ndecrease in accuracy. Although we have taken steps to improve our quality review, product documentation and reference testing procedures, we cannot guarantee that we will\nnot experience quality assurance issues with our products in the future. Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, delayed or lost revenue, delayed\nmarket acceptance, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources,\n27\nTable of Contents\nlegal claims, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, starting materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly\ntermination of existing customer relationships, increased insurance costs, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect\nto other batches or products, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Such defects or errors could also narrow\nthe scope of the use of our products, which could hinder our success in the market.\nEven after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved, any lingering concerns in our target markets regarding our technology or any manufacturing defects or\nperformance errors in our products or services could continue to result in lost revenue, delayed market acceptance, damage to our reputation and claims against us.\nIn addition, we may be unable to maintain the quality, reliability, robustness and expected turnaround times of our products and services to continue to satisfy customer demand\nas we grow. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, manufacturing and quality control systems and processes and other aspects of our\nbusiness and continue to effectively expand, train and manage our personnel. The time and resources required to improve our existing systems and procedures, implement new\nsystems and procedures and to adequately staff such existing and new systems and procedures is uncertain, and failure to complete this in a timely and efficient manner could\nadversely affect our operations and negatively impact our business and financial results. We may need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months\nor more to procure, set up and validate, establish new production processes and increase our personnel levels to meet increased demand. There can be no assurance that any of\nthese increases in scale, personnel expansion or equipment or process enhancements will be successfully implemented, or that we will have adequate space, including in our\nlaboratory and production facilities, to accommodate such required expansion. Failure to manage this growth or transition could result in delays in turnaround times, higher\nproduct costs, declining product quality, deteriorating customer service and slower responses to competitive challenges. A failure in any one of these areas could make it\ndifficult for us to meet market expectations for our products and services and could damage our reputation and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur products are highly complex and are subject to quality control requirements.\nWhether a product is produced by us or purchased from outside suppliers, it is subject to quality control procedures, including the verification of stability and performance and,\nfor certain products, additional validation required by certain GMP that we voluntarily follow, European Conformity (“CE”) marking and ISO 9001:2015 compliance, prior to\nfinal packaging. Certain of our products are manufactured following the voluntary GMP quality standards of the International Council for Harmonisation’s GMP Guide,\ncomparable GMP principles for the European Union and customer-specific requirements. We believe these products are exempt from compliance with the Food, Drug, and\nCosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the current GMP (“cGMP”) regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), as our products are further processed and incorporated into\nfinal drug products by our customers and we do not make claims related to their safety or effectiveness. In the event we, or our suppliers, produce products that fail to comply\nwith required quality standards, we may incur delays in fulfilling orders, write-downs, damages resulting from product liability claims and harm to our reputation.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall\nbelow expectations or any guidance we may provide.\nWe have no control over the timing and volume of purchases by our customers. As a result,our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes it\ndifficult for us to predict our revenues and future operating results. These fluctuations may be driven by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including,\nbut not limited to:\n• unused inventory of our products that our customers have on hand, which are not indication-specific, and our lack of insight as to the amount of unused inventory of our\nproducts that such customers have on hand;\n• changes in the level of our customers’ spending on and demand for our products and services, including as a result of, among other things, their own financial\nperformance, changes in their available resources, timing of their commercial manufacturing initiatives, their decision to acquire in-house manufacturing capacity (rather\nthan outsource), their spending priorities, including research and development budgets, and their budgetary policies and practices;\n• our ability to increase penetration in our existing markets and expand into new markets;\n• our customers accelerating, canceling, reducing or delaying orders as a result of developments related to their pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n• the relative reliability and robustness of our products and services;\n• changes in governmental regulations or the regulatory posture toward our business;\n• the volume and mix of the products and services we sell;\n28\nTable of Contents\n• changes in the production or sales costs related to our products and services;\n• the ongoing success of our newer products, such as our CleanCap® and mRNA products;\n• the rate of introduction of other new products or product enhancements by us or others in our industry;\n• the timing and amount of expenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional products, services and technologies or for other purposes, such\nas the expansion of our facilities;\n• changes in governmental and academic funding of life sciences research and developments or changes that impact budgets, budget cycles or seasonal spending patterns\nof our customers;\n• future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n• difficulties encountered by our commercial carriers in delivering our products, whether as a result of external factors such as weather or negative macroeconomic\nconditions or internal issues such as labor disputes;\n• the timing and magnitude of any adjustments to the Tax Receivable Agreement liability;\n• changes in the assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets;\n• general market conditions and other factors outside of our control, such as natural disasters, geopolitical unrest, war, terrorism, public health issues or other catastrophic\nevents; and\n• the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nThe impact of any one of the factors discussed above, or the cumulative effects of a combination of such factors, could result in significant fluctuations and unpredictability in\nour quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparisons of our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our\npast results as an indication of our future performance.\nAs a result of variability and unpredictability, we may also fail to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating\nresults fall short of the expectations of analysts or investors or any guidance we may provide, or if the guidance we provide falls short of the expectations of analysts or\ninvestors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met or exceeded any previously\npublicly stated guidance we may have provided.\nIf we are unable to manufacture in specific quantities, our operating results will be harmed.\nOur revenue and other operating results depend in large part on our ability to manufacture and ship our products in sufficient quantities. Any interruptions we experience in the\nmanufacturing or shipping of our products could delay our ability to recognize revenue in a particular quarter. Manufacturing problems can and do arise, and as demand for our\nproducts increases, any such problems could have an increasingly significant impact on our operating results. While we have not generally experienced problems with, or\ndelays in, our production capabilities that resulted in delays in our ability to ship finished products, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter such problems in the\nfuture. We may not be able to quickly ship products and recognize anticipated revenue for a given period if we experience significant delays in the manufacturing process. In\naddition, we must maintain sufficient production capacity in order to meet anticipated customer demand, and we may be unable to offset the associated fixed costs if orders\nslow, which would adversely affect our operating margins. If we are unable to manufacture and ship our products consistently, in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis, our\nrevenue, cash flow, gross margins and our other results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nNatural disasters, geopolitical unrest, war, terrorism, public health issues or other catastrophic events could disrupt the supply, delivery or demand of products and services,\nas well as our sites, which could negatively affect our operations and performance.\nWe are subject to the risk of disruption by earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, geopolitical unrest, war (including any escalation of\nthe ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine or the Gaza Strip), terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, public health issues, epidemics or pandemics and other events beyond our\ncontrol and the control of the third parties on which we depend. Any of these catastrophic events, whether in the United States or abroad, may have a significant negative impact\non the global economy, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors or customers, and could decrease demand for our products and services, create delays and\ninefficiencies in our supply chain and make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers.\nWe rely upon our internal manufacturing, packaging and distribution operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending\nsale. Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as\n29\nTable of Contents\nlabor disputes or social unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes, a public health crisis (such as a pandemic), earthquakes or other events beyond our control, could adversely\naffect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have significant operations in California, near major\nearthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk.\nIn addition, a catastrophic event that results in damage to specific equipment that would be difficult to replace, the destruction or disruption of our research and production\nfacilities or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results\nwould be adversely affected.\nStrategic transactions or acquisitions may require us to seek additional financing, which we may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe plan to continue a strategy of growth and development for our business. To this end, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including\nlicensing or acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses that would complement our existing portfolio of products and services. In order to complete such\nstrategic transactions, we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments and acquisitions. Should we need to do so, we may not be able to secure such\nfinancing, or obtain such financing on favorable terms, for reasons including rising interest rates and continued volatility and uncertainty in the U.S. and global capital and credit\nmarkets. Our credit agreement also contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant restrictions on our ability to make acquisitions or certain other\ninvestments, as well as to incur additional indebtedness to finance such acquisitions or other investments. In addition, future acquisitions may require the issuance or sale of\nadditional equity, or equity-linked securities, which may result in additional dilution to our shareholders.\nOur commercial success depends on the market acceptance of our life science reagents. Our reagents may not achieve or maintain significant commercial market\nacceptance.\nOur commercial success is dependent upon our ability to continue to successfully market and sell our life science reagents. Our ability to achieve and maintain commercial\nmarket acceptance of our products and services and provide customers access to our life science reagents will depend on a number of factors, including:\n• our ability to increase awareness of the capabilities of our technology and solutions;\n• our customers’ willingness to adopt new products, services and technologies;\n• whether our products and services reliably provide advantages over legacy and other alternative technologies and are perceived by customers to be cost effective;\n• our ability to execute on our strategy to scale-up our CleanCap® technology to meet increasing demand and provide channels to access our CleanCap® technology and\nlife science reagents;\n• the rate of adoption of our products and services by biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and others;\n• the relative reliability and robustness of our products and services as a whole and the components of our life science offerings, including, for example, CleanCap® and\nour assays for detecting host cell proteins;\n• our ability to develop new tools and solutions for customers;\n• whether competitors develop and commercialize products and services that provide comparable features and benefits at scale;\n• the impact of our investments in product innovation and commercial growth;\n• negative publicity regarding our or our competitors’ products resulting from defects or errors; and\n• our ability to further validate our technology through research and accompanying publications.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing these criteria or other criteria that might affect the market acceptance of our products and services. If we are\nunsuccessful in achieving and maintaining market acceptance of our products and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects\ncould be adversely affected.\nThe market may not be receptive to our new products and services upon their introduction.\nWe expect a portion of our future revenue growth to come from introducing new products, including plasmid DNA and GMP-grade mRNA. The commercial success of all of\nour products and services will depend upon their acceptance by the life science and biopharmaceutical industries. Some of the products and services that we are developing are\nbased upon new technologies or approaches. As a result, there can be no assurance that these new products and services, even if successfully developed and\n30\nTable of Contents\nintroduced, will be accepted by customers. If customers do not adopt our new products, services and technologies, our results of operations may suffer and, as a result, the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock may decline.\nIt may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for revenue growth in light of competitive challenges.\nWe face significant competition across many of our product lines. In addition, consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served\nto create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressure on us. Moreover, customers may believe\nthat larger companies are better able to compete as sole source vendors, and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses. Failure to anticipate and respond to competitors’\nactions may impact our future revenue and profitability.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted\ngrowth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nAddressable market estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. These\nestimates and forecasts are based on a number of complex assumptions and third-party estimates and other business data, including assumptions and estimates relating to our\nability to generate revenue from existing products and services and the development of new products and services. Our estimates and forecasts relating to the size and expected\ngrowth of our markets may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet our size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow at the\nrate we anticipate, if at all.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our strategic plan on a timely basis or at all, our business and future result of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur strategic plan was developed based upon market and technology trends that we currently believe present revenue growth opportunities, and in turn, long-term shareholder\nvalue creation. Our strategic plan includes a series of strategic priorities and cost realignment initiatives designed to drive growth and improve operational efficiency. Our ability\nto achieve our strategic initiatives is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed herein under the heading “Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy,” as well as\nchallenges we face with executing multiple initiatives simultaneously. For example, our commercial initiatives may not succeed, or we may lose market share due to challenges\nin choosing the right products to develop or the right customers to target for these products, or integrating products of acquired companies into our sales and marketing strategy.\nWe cannot assure you that we will overcome the risks associated with our strategic initiatives. If we fail to manage or overcome those risks, we may not realize the intended\nbenefits of our strategic plan and may incur additional expenses without related revenue growth. Our business, financial position and results of operations will be adversely\naffected if we fail to successfully implement our strategic initiatives or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities, limit sales of our existing products and limit commercialization of any products that we\nmay develop.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development, production, distribution, and sale of biotechnology products. We face an\ninherent risk of product liability exposure related to the use of certain of our products in our customers’ human clinical trials and product liability lawsuits may allege that our\nproducts or services identified inaccurate or incomplete information or otherwise failed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in, a\nmisunderstanding of or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide in the ordinary course of our business activities. If any of our products harm people due to our\nnegligence, willful misconduct, unlawful activities or material breach, or if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our products caused injuries, we could\nincur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in the following, any of which could impact our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, cash flows and prospects:\n• decreased demand for our products and any products that we may develop;\n• injury to our reputation;\n• costs to defend the related litigation;\n• loss of revenue; and\n• the inability to commercialize products that we may develop.\nWe maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions and may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending\nagainst product liability claims or the potential loss of revenue that may result.\n31\nTable of Contents\nAny product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future.\nWe may be unable to efficiently manage growth as a larger and more geographically diverse organization.\nOur strategic acquisitions, the continued expansion of our commercial sales operations and our organic growth have increased the scope and complexity of our business. As a\nresult, we will face challenges inherent in efficiently managing a more complex business with an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the\nneed to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs. Our inability to manage successfully the geographically more diverse and substantially\nlarger combined organization could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nOpportunistic acquisitions may pose risks and challenges that could adversely affect our business, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of acquisitions of\nbusinesses or technologies.\nWe have made in the past, and may make in the future, selected opportunistic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. In January 2022, we\nacquired MyChem LLC, a provider of proprietary, ultra-pure nucleotides to customers in the diagnostics, pharma, genomics and research markets to complement our nucleic\nacid business and in January 2023, we completed the acquisition of Alphazyme, LLC, an original equipment manufacturer provider of custom molecular biology enzymes,\nservicing customers in the genetic analysis and nucleic acid synthesis markets to complement our nucleic acid production business. However, we may be unable to continue to\nidentify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons, including competition among buyers, the high valuations of businesses in our industry, the need for regulatory and\nother approvals and the availability of capital, particularly during a period of disruption and volatility within the global capital and credit markets.\nAny acquisition involves numerous risks, uncertainties and operational, financial, and managerial challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects:\n• difficulties in integrating new operations, systems, technologies, products, services and personnel of acquired businesses effectively and in a timely manner;\n• difficulties in implementing and maintaining controls, procedures and policies with respect to our financial accounting systems, including disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, at acquired businesses that, prior to the acquisition, had lacked such controls, procedures and policies;\n• lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies and cost-savings, including enhanced revenue, technology, human resources, cost savings, operating\nefficiencies and other synergies;\n• difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses;\n• difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations, including risks associated with entering new or foreign markets in which we have no or limited prior\nexperience;\n• underperformance of any acquired technology, product, or business relative to our expectations and the price we paid;\n• negative near-term impacts on financial results after an acquisition, including acquisition-related earnings charges;\n• the potential loss of key employees, customers, contractual relationships, and strategic partners of acquired companies;\n• declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of businesses that we acquire, which may result from changes in compensation, or changes in\nmanagement, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired business;\n• claims by terminated employees and shareholders of acquired companies or other third parties related to the transaction;\n• the assumption or incurrence of historical liabilities, obligations and expenses of the acquired business, including unforeseen and contingent or similar liabilities that are\ndifficult to identify or accurately quantify, or other litigation-related liabilities and regulatory actions;\n• the assumption or incurrence of additional debt obligations or expenses, or use of substantial portions of our cash;\n• the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions that dilute the ownership of our shareholders;\n• the issuance of equity securities to finance or as consideration for any acquisitions may not be an option if the price of our Class A common stock is low or volatile\nwhich could preclude us from completing any such acquisitions;\n32\nTable of Contents\n• the assumption of certain collaboration, strategic alliance and licensing arrangement may require us to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or products, or grant\nlicenses on terms that are not favorable to us;\n• disruption of our ongoing operations, diversion of management’s attention and company resources from existing operations of the business, and the dedication of\nsignificant efforts and expense across all operational areas, including sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing, finance, legal and information\ntechnologies;\n• the impairment of intangible assets as a result of technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of acquired companies;\n• the need to later divest acquired assets at a loss if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;\n• risks associated with acquiring intellectual property, including potential disputes regarding acquired companies’ intellectual property; and\n• difficulties relating to operating with increased leverage and incurring additional interest expense as a result of financing acquisitions with additional indebtedness, which\ncould make us more vulnerable to downturns.\nThere can be no assurance we will identify promising acquisition opportunities. Even if we do, there can be no assurance that any of the acquisitions we have made, or that we\nmay make, will be successful or will be, or will remain, profitable. Our failure to successfully address the foregoing risks may prevent us from achieving the anticipated benefits\nfrom any past or future acquisition in a reasonable time frame, or at all.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue\nCode, and it is possible that changes in laws or certain transactions or a combination of certain transactions may result in material additional limitations on our ability to\nuse our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is\ngenerally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses\nrecognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or\nmore of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly\ntaxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long-term, tax-exempt\nrate and the value of the company’s stock immediately before the ownership change. As a result, following any such ownership change, we might be unable to offset our taxable\nincome with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire, in which event we could incur larger federal and state income tax liabilities than we\nwould have had we not experienced an ownership change. In addition, under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017, may be utilized to offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act\n(“CARES Act”) was signed into law and changed certain provisions of the TCJA. Under the CARES Act, NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and\nbefore January 1, 2021 may be carried back to each of the five taxable years preceding the tax year of such loss, but NOLs arising in taxable years beginning after December\n31, 2020 may not be carried back. In addition, the CARES Act eliminates the limitation on the deduction of NOLs to 80% of current year taxable income for taxable years\nbeginning before January 1, 2021, but the 80% limitation applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2020. As such, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the\nuse of our NOLs.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets, or other investments become impaired.\nWe are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill, amortizable\nintangible assets and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not\nbe recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in\nthe business climate and actual or projected operating results (affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of\nour business. We may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired.\nAny such charge would adversely impact our consolidated financial results.\n33\nTable of Contents\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to create and\ninterpret appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a material effect on our reported results,\nas well as our processes and related controls, and may retroactively affect previously reported results.\nOur revenue recognition and other factors may impact our financial results in any given period and make them difficult to predict.\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligations have been satisfied in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those\nperformance obligations. Our revenue includes revenue from the sale of manufactured products, including products that can be purchased out of a catalog and custom\nmanufactured products, and services, including custom antibody and assay development contracts, antibody affinity extraction and stability and feasibility studies, as well as\ncertain licensing and royalty arrangements. The majority of our contracts include only one performance obligation, namely the delivery of products, both custom and catalog,\nand services. We also recognize revenue from other contracts that may include a combination of products and services, the provision of solely services, or from license fee\narrangements which may be associated with the delivery of product. Our application of the revenue recognition accounting guidance with respect to the nature of future\ncontractual arrangements could impact the forecasting of our revenue for future periods, as both the mix of products and services we will sell in a given period, as well as the\nsize of contracts, is difficult to predict.\nFurthermore, the presentation of our financial results requires us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect revenue recognition. In some instances, we could\nreasonably use different estimates and assumptions, and changes in estimates may occur from period to period. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates—Revenue Recognition.”\nGiven the foregoing factors, comparing our revenue and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results may not be indicative of our\nfuture performance.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a variety of tax liabilities, including federal, state, foreign and other taxes such as income, sales/use, payroll, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. Changes in\ntax laws or their interpretations could decrease our net income, the value of any tax loss carryforwards, the value of tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and our cash flows,\nand accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. In addition, our tax liabilities are\nsubject to periodic audits by the relevant taxing authority, which could increase our tax liabilities.\nOur business is subject to a number of environmental risks.\nOur manufacturing business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals and is therefore subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and\nregulations and to periodic inspections for possible violations of these laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations are\nsignificant. Any violations, even if inadvertent or accidental, of current or future environmental and safety laws or regulations and the cost of compliance with any resulting\norder or fine could adversely affect our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a high percentage of our revenue. If we cannot maintain our current relationships with customers, fail to sustain\nrecurring sources of revenue with our existing customers, or if we fail to enter into new relationships, our future operating results will be adversely affected.\nRevenue from our largest customers were 19.3%, 61.2% and 68.1% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The revenue\nattributable to our top customers has fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, cash flows and prospects. In addition, the termination of these relationships, including following any failure to renew a long-term contract, could result in a\ntemporary or permanent loss of revenue. See also “—The extent and duration of our revenue associated with COVID-19 related products and services are uncertain and are\ndependent, in important respects, on factors outside our control.”\nOur future success depends on our ability to maintain these relationships, to increase our penetration among these existing customers and to establish new relationships. We\nengage in conversations with other companies and institutions regarding\n34\nTable of Contents\npotential commercial opportunities on an ongoing basis, which can be time consuming. There is no assurance that any of these conversations will result in a commercial\nagreement, or if an agreement is reached, that the resulting relationship will be successful. Speculation in the industry about our existing or potential commercial relationships\ncan be a catalyst for adverse speculation about us, our products, our services and our technology, which can adversely affect our reputation and our business. In addition, if our\ncustomers order our products or services, but fail to pay on time or at all, our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure investors that we will be able to further penetrate our existing markets or that our products or services will gain adequate market acceptance. Any failure to\nincrease penetration in our existing markets would adversely affect our ability to improve our operating results.\nWe rely on distribution arrangements to market and sell our products and services, including in certain international markets, and our failure to maintain and successfully\nmanage these arrangements or to renew or identify and implement additional arrangements on favorable terms, if at all, may impair our ability to effectively distribute and\nmarket our products and adversely impact our revenues and future results of operations.\nWe rely on certain distributors in order to market and sell ourp roducts and services in in certain international markets, particularly our biologics safety testing products and\nservices in China. Our distributor in China accounted for 4.8% of our total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2023. If we are unable to maintain this distributor or enter\ninto a similar arrangement with another distributor, or our current or future distributors do not perform adequately, our revenues and results of operations would likely be\nadversely impacted, at least temporarily. Additionally, changes in the inventory levels of our products owned and held by our distributors can result in significant variability in\nour revenues. Furthermore, our revenues from such distributors could be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions specific to the geographic markets in which our\nproducts and services are marketed and sold, geopolitical risks and other risks described below under “We are subject to financial, operating, legal and compliance risks\nassociated with global operations.”\nWe may pursue additional arrangements regarding the sales and marketing and distribution of one or more of our products and services, including if we intend to grow our\nbusiness internationally in certain geographic markets, and the success of our strategic initiatives and our future revenue growth may depend, in part, on our ability to enter into\nand maintain arrangements with other companies having sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and the ability of such companies to successfully market and sell any such\nproducts and services. Any failure to enter into such arrangements and marketing alliances on favorable terms, if at all, could delay or impair our ability to distribute or market\nour products and services and could increase our costs of distribution and marketing.\nOur use of distribution arrangements and marketing alliances to commercialize our products and services subject us to a number of risks, including the following:\n• we may be required to relinquish important rights to our products;\n• we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors or collaborators may devote to the distribution or marketing of our products;\n• our distributors or collaborators may experience financial difficulties; and\n• business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator’s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator’s willingness or ability to complete its obligations\nunder any arrangement.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of our raw materials and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition\nto alternative suppliers.\nCertain of our raw materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers and some materials, including a proprietary DNA reagent, certain packaging materials, specific cell\nlines for Cygnus Technologies’ operations and certain raw materials used in our nucleic acid production products, as well as those raw materials sold under the Glen Research\nbrand, are sole sourced. Delays or difficulties in securing these raw materials or other laboratory materials could result in an interruption in our production operations if we\ncannot obtain an acceptable substitute. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains have faced challenges, including material availability, global logistics\ndelays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers, and these challenges have been exacerbated by the ongoing\nmacroeconomic conditions as discussed above. Any interruption of our supply chain could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows and prospects. While we may identify other suppliers, raw materials furnished by such replacement suppliers may require us to alter our production operations or perform\nextensive validations, which may be time consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure alternative materials and revalidate them without\nexperiencing interruptions in our workflow. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in obtaining raw materials, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash\nflows and prospects could be adversely affected.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on a stable and adequate supply of quality raw materials from our suppliers, and price increases or interruptions of such supply could have an adverse impact\non our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices. Cost and wage inflation, ongoing supply disruptions and logistics capacity constraints have\nincreased, or may increase, our costs to manufacture and distribute our products and services. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price due to\ninflationary pressures or other factors, we may not be able to produce certain of our products at marketable prices or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nresults of operations.\nAlthough we believe that we have stable relationships with our existing suppliers, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure a stable supply of raw materials going\nforward. Our suppliers may not be able to keep up with our pace of growth or may reduce or cease their supply of raw materials to us at any time. In addition, we cannot assure\nyou that our suppliers have obtained and will be able to obtain or maintain all licenses, permits and approvals necessary for their operations or comply with all applicable laws\nand regulations, and failure to do so by them may lead to interruption in their business operations, which in turn may result in shortages of raw materials supplied to us. Some of\nour suppliers are based overseas and therefore may need to maintain export or import licenses. If the supply of raw materials is interrupted, due to ongoing supply chain\ndisruptions or other factors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.\nBecause we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services, damages or losses sustained during shipping or significant\nincreases in prices could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as World Courier, FedEx, UPS and DHL. If one or more\nof these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to\nincur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in\nour delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience performance\nproblems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and our customers’ experience. In the past, some of our products have sustained serious damage\nin transit such that they were no longer usable. Although we have taken steps to improve our packaging and shipping containers, there is no guarantee our products will not\nbecome damaged or lost in transit in the future. If our products are damaged or lost in transit, it may result in a substantial delay in the fulfillment of our customer’s order and,\ndepending on the type and extent of the damage, it may result in a substantial financial loss. If our products are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged or lost during\nthe delivery process, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease using our products or our services, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nOur products could become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA or other regulatory agencies in the future, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent\ncommercialization of our products, thereby materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe make certain of our products available to customers as research-use-only (“RUO”) products. RUO products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, and includei n\nvitro diagnostic products in the laboratory research phase of development that are being shipped or delivered for an investigation that is not subject to the FDA’s investigational\ndevice exemption requirements. Although medical devices are subject to stringent FDA oversight, products that are intended for RUO and are labeled as RUO are exempt from\ncompliance with most FDA requirements, including premarket clearance or approval, manufacturing requirements, and others. A product labeled RUO but which is actually\nintended for clinical diagnostic use may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA, and subject to FDA enforcement action. The FDA has indicated\nthat when determining the intended use of a product labeled RUO, the FDA will consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of the product,\nincluding how the product is marketed and to whom. The FDA could disagree with our assessment that our products are properly marketed as RUO, or could conclude that\nproducts labeled as RUO are actually intended for clinical diagnostic use, and could take enforcement action against us, including requiring us to stop distribution of our\nproducts until we are in compliance with applicable regulations, which would reduce our revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of\noperations and financial condition. In the event that the FDA requires us to obtain marketing authorization of our RUO products in the future, there can be no assurance that the\nFDA will grant any clearance or approval requested by us in a timely manner, or at all.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOur raw material products are manufactured following the voluntary quality standards of ISO 9001:2015. Our GMP-grade raw material products follow ISO 9001:2015\nstandards, additional voluntary GMP quality standards and customer specific requirements. We believe these raw material products, including our GMP-grade raw material\nproducts, are exempt from compliance with the FDCA and the cGMP regulations of the FDA, as our products are further processed by our customers and we do not make\nclaims related to their safety or effectiveness. We provide API products to customers for use in preclinical studies through and including clinical trials. Our API products are\nmanufactured following the principles detailed in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Q7, Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical\nIngredients (Section 19, APIs For Use in Clinical Trials) in order to comply with the applicable requirements of the FDCA, and the comparable GMP principles for Europe;\nEuropean Community, Part II, Basic Requirements for Active Substances Used as Starting Materials (Section 19, APIs For Use in Clinical Trials). Manufacture of APIs for use\nin clinical trials is regulated under § 501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, but is not subject to the current GMP regulations in 21 CFR § 211 by operation of 21 CFR § 210. Our API\nproducts are provided to customers under customer contracts that outline quality standards and product specifications. As products advance through the clinical phases,\nrequirements become more stringent and we work with customers to define and agree on requirements and risks associated with their product.\nThe FDA could disagree with our assessment that our products are exempt from current GMP regulations. In addition, the FDA could conclude that the raw material and API\nproducts we provide to our customers are actually subject to the pharmaceutical or drug quality-related regulations for manufacturing, processing, packing or holding of drugs or\nfinished pharmaceuticals, and could take enforcement action against us, including requiring us to stop distribution of our products until we are in compliance with applicable\nregulations, which would reduce our revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In the event that the\nFDA requires us to comply with FDA regulations, for our raw material and API products in the future, including the FDA’s current GMP regulations, there can be no assurance\nthat the FDA will find our operations are in compliance in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe are subject to stringent privacy laws, information security laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security and changes in\nsuch laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of proprietary information and personally\nidentifiable information (“PII”), which among other things, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of certain individually identifiable\ninformation.\nNumerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws,\ngovern the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information. These laws continue to change and evolve and are increasing in breadth and impact. Failure to\ncomply with any of these laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for\ndamages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations, cash flows and prospects. Additionally, if we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of personal information, we could be found to have breached\nour contracts.\nMany states in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”),\nwhich increases privacy rights for California residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information, came into effect on January 1, 2020.\nAmong other things, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy\nrights, including the ability to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain\ndata breaches that result in the loss of personal information. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which took effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain\nprovisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022), amended the CCPA. Amongst other things, the CPRA and eliminated the “employee exemption” under the CCPA,\nmakes a distinction between “personal information” and “sensitive personal information,” imposing heightened protections for “sensitive personal information,” and brings\nbusiness-to-business transactions under its purview. These laws and others like it are yet to be tested and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and overall\nrisk. Further, there is discussion in Congress of a new federal data protection and privacy law to which we would become subject, if it is enacted.\nVarious foreign countries in which we operate also have, or are developing, laws that govern the collection, use, disclosure, security and cross-border transmission of personal\ninformation. For example, in the European Union (the “EU”) and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data is governed by the provisions of the General Data\nProtection Regulation (“GDPR”), in addition to other applicable laws and regulations. The GDPR came into effect in May 2018,and has resulted in, and will continue to result\nin, significantly greater compliance burdens and costs for companies like us. Any data security breach could require notifications to the data subject and/or owners under U.S.\nfederal, U.S. state, and/or international data\n37\nTable of Contents\nbreach notification laws and regulations. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations, which\ncould increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with noncompliance. We cannot guarantee that we are, or will be, in compliance with all applicable international\nregulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve.\nIt is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules\nmay be unsuccessful. We must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. Failure to comply with federal, state and international\nlaws regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to penalties under such laws, orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages or\nother liabilities, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Even if we\nare not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative\npublicity, which have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe are subject to export and import control laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate\nsuch laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to U.S. export controls and sanctions regulations that restrict the shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries, governments and\npersons. While we take precautions to prevent our products and services from being exported in violation of these laws, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will\nprevent violations of export control and sanctions laws. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and\npenalties for us and for the individuals working for us. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or\notherwise. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations may be time consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or impose other costs. Any\nchange in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations,\ncould result in our decreased ability to export or sell certain products and services to existing or potential customers in affected jurisdictions.\nChanges in political, economic or governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products and services or increase our expenses.\nWe compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and\nfood and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products and services to meet customer needs created by those regulations. The U.S. and international\nhealthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that could significantly affect the drug development process, research and development\ncosts and the pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, and also may increase the likelihood of legislative or regulatory changes that could impact us or our\nbusiness operations. Any significant change in regulations could have an adverse effect on both our customers’ business and our business, which could result in reduced demand\nfor our products and services or increases in our expenses. For example, we provide products and services used for basic research, raw materials used by biopharmaceutical\ncustomers for further processing, and active pharmaceutical ingredients used for preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nChanges in the FDA’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process may have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to conduct and fund clinical trials,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on the demand for the products and services we provide these customers. Additionally, the U.S. government and governments\nworldwide have increased efforts to expand healthcare coverage while at the same time curtailing and better controlling the increasing costs of healthcare. If cost-containment\nefforts limit our customers’ profitability, they may decrease research and development spending, which could decrease the demand for our products and services and materially\nadversely affect our growth prospects. Any of these factors could harm our customers’ businesses, which, in turn, could materially adversely hurt our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe are subject to financial, operating, legal and compliance risk associated with global operations.\nWe engage in business globally, with approximately 51%, 62% and 60% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, coming from\noutside the U.S. In addition, one of our strategies is to expand geographically, both through distribution and through direct sales. This subjects us to a number of risks, including\ninternational economic, political, and labor conditions; currency fluctuations; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on income earned by foreign subsidiaries); increased financial\naccounting and reporting burdens and complexities; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; failure of laws to protect intellectual\nproperty rights adequately; inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export\nlicenses for\n38\nTable of Contents\ncertain technology; tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; transportation delays; operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent\nbusiness practices; and other factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters, climate change and diseases.\nThe application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve\nsignificant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal\nsanctions, prohibited business conduct, and damage to our reputation. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become\nsubject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the U.S.\nWe may expand our operations in countries with developing economies, where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by anti-corruption and anti-\nbribery laws and regulations that apply to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.S. Travel Act, and the UK Bribery Act 2010, which prohibit\nimproper payments or offers of payment to foreign governments and political parties by us for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we implement policies\nand procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, distributors and agents, including those based in\nforeign countries where practices which violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies. Any such non-compliance, even if prohibited by our\ninternal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties.\nOur activities are and will continue to be subject to extensive government regulation, which is expensive and time consuming.\nWe are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect\nus.\nWe provide products and services used for basic research, raw materials and life science reagents used by biopharmaceutical customers for further processing, assays for\nbiologics safety testing and active pharmaceutical ingredients used for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The quality of our products and services is critical to researchers\nlooking to develop novel vaccines and therapies and for biopharmaceutical customers who use our products as raw materials or who are engaged in preclinical studies and\nclinical trials. Biopharmaceutical customers are subject to extensive regulations by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries for conducting clinical trials and\ncommercializing products for therapeutic or diagnostic use. This regulatory scrutiny results in our customers imposing rigorous quality requirements on us as their supplier\nthrough supplier qualification processes and customer contracts.\nAdditionally, regulatory authorities and our customers may conduct scheduled or unscheduled periodic inspections of our facilities to monitor our regulatory compliance or\ncompliance with our quality agreements with our customers. There are significant risks at each stage of the regulatory scheme for our customers.\nRegulatory agencies may in the future take action against us or our customers for failure to comply with applicable regulations governing clinical trials and the development and\ntesting of therapeutic products. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any\ninspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt\nmanufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to\nproducts or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for\nreimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant.\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the\nhandling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-\ncompetition laws. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in\ncriminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, lenders, customers, government regulators and other market participants with respect to our Environmental,\nSocial and Governance (“ESG”) policies and activities may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries and around the globe are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies, initiatives and activities by investors, lenders, customers,\ngovernment regulators and other market participants. In particular, these constituencies are increasingly focusing on environmental stewardship, including climate change, water\nuse, deforestation,\n39\nTable of Contents\nwaste, and other sustainability concerns, as well as diversity and inclusion, workplace conduct, support for local communities, and other human capital and social issues.\nThere is no guarantee that any ESG or sustainability goals set forth in our ESG initiatives will be achieved on the desired timeframe or at all, and the achievement of any such\ngoals may require the incurrence of additional costs or the implementation of operational changes, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.\nAdditionally, changes in legal and regulatory requirements related to ESG have been issued in the E.U., its Member States and other countries, particularly with respect to\nclimate change, emission reduction and environmental stewardship in the U.S., amongst other regulatory efforts, the SEC has proposed rules to enhance and standardize climate-\nrelated disclosures in public company filings. We expect legal, regulatory and reporting requirements related to ESG matters to continue to expand globally and increase our\ncosts of compliance.\nIf we are unable to meet our ESG initiatives or evolving investor, industry, or customer expectations and standards, or we are perceived to have not responded adequately on\nany number of ESG matters, we risk damage to our brand and reputation, adverse impacts to our ability to secure government contracts, decreased desirability of our common\nstock to investors, or limited access to capital markets and other sources of financing.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Technology\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property protection for our current or future products, or if the scope of our intellectual property protection is\nnot sufficiently broad, our ability to commercialize our products successfully and to compete effectively may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our current\nand future proprietary products. We rely upon a combination of patents and trade secret protection to protect the intellectual property related to our technology, manufacturing\nprocesses, and products. Our commercial success depends in part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our current and future products, if any, and\nthe methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending and protecting such patents and trade secrets against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third\nparties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products is dependent upon the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents and\nother intellectual property that covers these activities.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost\nor in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. It is also possible that we may fail to identify patentable aspects of our\nresearch and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. In addition, we or our collaborators may only pursue, obtain or maintain patent protection in a\nlimited number of countries. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. We may be unaware of\nprior art that could be used to invalidate or narrow the scope of an issued patent or prevent our pending patent applications from issuing as patents. This may be (1) because\npatent applications in the United States, Europe and many other non-U.S. jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, (2)\nbecause publications of discoveries in scientific literature lag behind actual discoveries, and (3) because we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the\ninventions claimed in any of our owned or any in-licensed issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for protection of the\ninventions set forth in our patents or patent applications. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or maintain protection for certain inventions. Even if patents do successfully\nissue, such patents may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our current or future products, prevent others from designing around our claims\nor otherwise provide us with a competitive advantage. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue, the breadth of any such patents or whether any\nissued patents will be found invalid or unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. In addition, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership,\ninventorship or scope of any of our patents. Any successful challenge to any of our patents could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of our\ncurrent or future products and could impair or eliminate our ability to collect future revenue and royalties with respect to such products. If any of our patent applications with\nrespect to our current or future products fail to result in issued patents, if their breadth or strength of protection is narrowed or threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful\nexclusivity or competitive position, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us or otherwise adversely affect our competitive position.\nThe patent positions of life science companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved.\nNo consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in life science patents has emerged to date in the United States. The standards applied by the United States Patent\nand Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably and can change.\n40\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have\nencountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop\nthe infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of our patents or other intellectual property, including the unauthorized reproduction of our manufacturing or other know-\nhow or the marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property rights generally. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition\nfrom third parties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nFurther, the existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize products covered by such a patent. Third parties may\nhave or obtain rights to patents which they may use to prevent or attempt to prevent us from practicing our patented technology or commercializing our patented products. If\nany of these other parties are successful in obtaining valid and enforceable patents, and establishing our infringement of those patents, we could be prevented from selling our\nproducts unless we were able to obtain a license under such third-party patents, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, third parties\nmay seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents,\nincluding by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency of competent jurisdiction may find our patents invalid or\nunenforceable. Our competitors and other third parties may also be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative products in a non-infringing manner. Any\nof the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIn addition, competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained or are unable to adequately enforce patent protection to develop their own\nproducts and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States and\nEurope. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing\nwith us. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our\nbusiness, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke\nthird parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially\nmeaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the\nintellectual property that we develop, acquire or license.\nIntellectual property that we own or in-license may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example, one of our patents is co-owned with third\nparties and some of our patent rights in the future may be co-owned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners’ interest\nin such patent rights, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products\nand technology. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of such patent rights in order to enforce such patent rights against third parties, and such\ncooperation may not be provided to us. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of\noperations, and prospects.\nMoreover, the research resulting in certain of our patents and technology was funded in part by the U.S. government. As a result, the U.S. government has certain rights to such\npatent rights and technology, which include march-in rights. When new technologies are developed with government funding, in order to secure ownership of such patent rights,\nthe recipient of such funding is required to comply with certain government regulations, including timely disclosing the inventions claimed in such patent rights to the U.S.\ngovernment and timely electing title to such inventions. Additionally, the U.S. government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive\nlicense authorizing the government to use the invention or to have others use the invention on its behalf. Accordingly, we or our licensors have granted the U.S. government a\nnonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States, the inventions described in the patents and patent\napplications relating to such inventions. If the U.S. government decides to exercise these rights, it is not required to engage us as its contractor in connection with doing so. The\ngovernment’s rights may also permit it to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or allow third parties to use such\ngovernment-funded technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the\ngovernment-funded technology, or because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S.\nindustry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such inventions in the United States. If we fail to\ncomply with those requirements, we could lose our ownership of or other rights to any patents subject to such regulations. Any exercise by the government of any of the\nforegoing rights or by any third party of its reserved rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations,\nand prospects.\n41\nTable of Contents\nFurthermore, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the unextended expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its non-provisional application filing date.\nVarious extensions may be available, however, the life of a patent and the protection it affords is limited. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing,\nregulatory review and approval of new products, our patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. If we encounter\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product under patent protection could be further reduced. Even if patents covering\nour future products are obtained, once such patents expire, we may be vulnerable to competition from similar products. The launch of a similar version of one of our products\nwould likely result in an immediate and substantial reduction in the demand for our product. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude\nothers from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and prospects.\nIf we are prevented from enforcing our intellectual property rights because of governmental regulatory policies or political pressure or action, our sales and profitability\nmay be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our product sales and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights.\nProposed actions to waive intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines and associated technology, such as those under discussion at the World Trade Organization,\nwhich are supported by the U.S. government, may impact our ability to fully assert our intellectual property rights related to our CleanCap® product in connection with the\nproduction of COVID-19 vaccines. Further, these policy actions may complicate our analysis and decision-making with respect to both research and development and capital\ninvestment, given the potential for lower returns on those investments that could result from our inability to fully protect our intellectual property. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully navigate these considerations, the future revenues and profitability of our business could be negatively impacted. We are unable to estimate the impact of these\npotential policies given that they remain undefined and their adoption is uncertain.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our customers, collaborators or other contractors, have been and may in the future be subject to cyber-attacks or security\nbreaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows and prospects.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our customers are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized\naccess. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the\ndeployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity\nand availability of information. Cyber-attacks also could include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause unauthorized payments or information to be transmitted to an\nunintended recipient. A material cyber-attack or security breach could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our business operations,\ndamage to our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including, among other things, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual\nproperty, and proprietary business information. Any cyber-attack or security breach that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal or proprietary information\ncould harm our reputation, cause us not to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws\nand regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. In addition, we could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification\nor intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the information systems and networks of our company and our vendors, including personal information\nof our employees, and company and vendor confidential data. In addition, outside parties have previously attempted and may in the future attempt to penetrate our systems or\nthose of our vendors or fraudulently induce our personnel or the personnel of our vendors to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data and/or systems or\nmake unauthorized payments to third parties. Like other companies, we have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, data security incidents involving access\nto company data, unauthorized payments and threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, phishing, business email compromise attacks, or other\ncyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. If a material breach of our information technology systems or those of our vendors\noccurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and our reputation and credibility could be damaged.\nWe could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to respond to these threats or breaches and to repair or replace information systems or\nnetworks and could suffer financial loss or the loss of valuable confidential information. In addition, we could be subject to regulatory actions and/or claims made by individuals\nand groups in private litigation involving privacy issues related to data collection and use practices and other data privacy laws and regulations,\n42\nTable of Contents\nincluding claims for misuse or inappropriate disclosure of data, as well as unfair or deceptive practices. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to\nprevent these events from occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly\nand requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, despite our\nefforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely and there can be no assurance that any measures we take will prevent cyber-attacks or security\nbreaches that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be materially adversely affected.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. To maintain the confidentiality of\ntrade secrets and other proprietary information, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, collaborators, CDMOs, CROs and others\nupon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or entity or made known to the\nindividual or entity by us during the course of the individual’s or entity’s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with\nemployees as well as our personnel policies also generally provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our\nexclusive property or that we may obtain full rights to such inventions at our election. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to\nprotect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, collaborators, CDMOs, CROs and others may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to\ncompetitors. We also face the risk that present or former employees could continue to hold rights to intellectual property used by us, demand the registration of intellectual\nproperty rights in their name, and seek payment of damages for our use of such intellectual property.\nEnforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained or is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. We may not have\nadequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the case of a breach of any such agreements and our\ntrade secrets and other proprietary information could be disclosed to third parties, including our competitors. Many of our partners also collaborate with our competitors and\nother third parties. The disclosure of our trade secrets to our competitors, or more broadly, would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our rights,\nand failure to maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. Courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop\nsubstantially equivalent or superior knowledge, methods and know-how, and the existence of our own trade secrets affords no protection against such independent discovery.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful and could result in a court or\nadministrative body finding our patents to be invalid or unenforceable.\nEven if the patent applications we own or license are issued, third parties may challenge or infringe upon our patents. To counter infringement, we may be required to file\ninfringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are\ncommonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including novelty, non-obviousness (or inventive\nstep), written description or enablement. In addition, patent validity challenges may, under certain circumstances, be based upon non-statutory obviousness-type double\npatenting, which, if successful, could result in a finding that the claims are invalid for obviousness-type double patenting or the loss of patent term if a terminal disclaimer is\nfiled to obviate a finding of obviousness-type double patenting. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the\npatent withheld information material to patentability from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution.\nThird parties may raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-\nexamination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition\nproceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation or cancellation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our current or future\nproducts or provide any competitive advantage. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. If a third party were to prevail on a\nlegal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we could lose part or all of the patent protection on one or more of our current or future products, which could result in our\ncompetitors and other third parties using our technology to compete with us. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\n43\nTable of Contents\nInterference proceedings, or other similar enforcement and revocation proceedings, provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of\ninventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it\nfrom the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or\ninterference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent,\nalone or with our licensors, infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those\nrights as fully as in the United States.\nIn an infringement proceeding, even one initiated by us, there is a risk that a court will decide that our patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other\nparty from using the inventions they describe. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground\nthat such other party’s activities do not infringe our rights to these patents.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In\naddition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to\ncontinue our operations. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us, especially as we\ngain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company.\nAn adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against competitors, affect our ability to receive royalties or\nother licensing consideration from our licensees, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making, using and selling similar or competitive products.\nAny of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIf we are sued for infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and\ncould prevent or delay us from developing or commercializing our current or future products.\nOur products may infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, one or more claims of an issued patent or may fall within the scope of one or more claims in a published patent\napplication that may be subsequently issued and to which we do not hold a license or other rights.\nBecause patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and\npublications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our\nissued patents or our pending applications, or that we were the first to invent the technology. Others, including our competitors, may have filed, and may in the future file, patent\napplications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain\nrights to issued patents by others covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an\ninterference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that\nsuch efforts would be unsuccessful if, unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a\nloss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nAdditionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our current or future\nproducts or the use of our current or future products. After issuance, the scope of patent claims remains subject to construction based on interpretation of the law, the written\ndisclosure in a patent and the patent’s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect. In addition,\nthird parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. These third parties could bring claims against us or our\ncollaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages.\nThe life sciences industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products\nor methods of use. Because the patent granting process is imperfect, the manufacture, distribution, or sale of our products may require us to challenge intellectual property rights\nby third parties that we believe to have been improperly granted. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If\nwe are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that\nthe patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing\nevidence in trial court litigation to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Third parties have, and may\n44\nTable of Contents\nin the future have, U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending patent applications that may cover our current or future products. Such a third party may claim that we or our\nmanufacturing or commercialization partners are using inventions covered by the third party’s patent rights and may go to court or a tribunal to stop us from engaging in our\nnormal operations and activities, including making or selling our current or future products. In the event that any of these patent rights were asserted against us, we believe that\nwe have defenses against any such action, including that such patents would not be infringed by our current or future products and/or that such patents are not valid. However, if\nany such patent rights were to be asserted against us and our defenses to such assertion were unsuccessful, unless we obtain a license to such patents, we could be liable for\ndamages, which could be significant and include treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to willfully infringe such patents, and we could be precluded from\ncommercializing any future products that were ultimately held to infringe such patents, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIf we are found to infringe the patent rights of a third party, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose or be required to seek a license from a third\nparty and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. In particular, any of our competitors that control\nintellectual property that we are found to infringe may be unwilling to provide us a license under any terms. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the\nrights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a\nproduct, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter\ninto licenses on acceptable terms. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully\ninfringed a patent. Further, if a patent infringement suit is brought against us or our third-party service providers and if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required\nthird-party intellectual property, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our current or future products, or to develop or license replacement\ntechnology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis, and may delay or require us to abandon our development, manufacturing or sales activities\nrelating to our current or future products. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our future products or force us to cease some of our business\noperations, which could harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative\nimpact on our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIntellectual property litigation and other proceedings could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our, our licensors’ or other third parties’ intellectual property claims may\ncause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant\nmanagement time. If not resolved in our favor, litigation may require us to pay any portion of our opponents’ legal fees. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially\nincrease our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient\nfinancial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and\nproceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from our participation in patent litigation or other proceedings\ncould have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in certain jurisdictions in\nconnection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There\ncould also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to\nbe negative, the perceived value of our current or future products or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under any license agreements, disagree over contract interpretation, or otherwise experience disruptions to our business\nrelationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary to our business.\nWe rely, in part, on intellectual property and technology which we have in-licensed. We may also need to obtain additional licenses in the future to advance our research or\nallow commercialization of our future products and it is possible that we may be unable to do so at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. Moreover, such licenses\nmay not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or\ncommercialize our future products.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, our existing license agreements impose, and any future license agreements we enter into may impose, various development, commercialization, funding, milestone,\nroyalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. Our license agreements, and any future license agreement we enter\ninto, may also impose restrictions on our ability to license certain of our intellectual property to third parties or to develop or commercialize certain current or future products or\ntechnologies. In spite of our best efforts, our counterparties may conclude that we have breached our obligations under our agreements, or that we have used the intellectual\nproperty licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, in which case, we may be required to pay damages and the counterparty may have the right to terminate the agreement. Any\nof the foregoing could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed intellectual property or technology, or enable a\ncompetitor to gain access to the licensed intellectual property or technology.\nWe might not have the necessary rights or the financial resources to develop, manufacture or market our current or future products without the rights granted under our license\nagreements, and the loss of sales or potential sales in current or future products covered by such license agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nDisputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to license agreements, including:\n• the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation related issues;\n• the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the license agreement;\n• the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n• our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n• our financial obligations under the license agreement;\n• the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n• the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology to or from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements\nmay be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our\nrights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed\nprevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize\nthe affected future products.\nIn some cases, we may not have primary control over prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of patents and patent applications that we have in-licensed from third\nparties, and instead we rely on our licensors for these activities. We cannot be certain that such activities have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations or in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If we do undertake any enforcement of our in-licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the\ninvalidity of such patents, such actions may be subject to the cooperation of our licensors or other third parties. If our licensors or other third parties fail to prosecute, maintain,\nenforce and defend intellectual property licensed to us, or lose their own rights to such intellectual property, the rights we have licensed may be impaired or eliminated and our\nability to develop and commercialize any of our products that are subject to such rights could be adversely affected.\nIn-licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property is a competitive area and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or\nacquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary for our business. These companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to\ntheir size, cash resources and greater capabilities with respect to clinical development and commercialization. Furthermore, companies that perceive us as a competitor may be\nunwilling to assign or license rights to us. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual\nproperty rights we have on reasonable terms or at all, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or current or future product and our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could suffer.\n46\nTable of Contents\nChanges to the patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and\nthe enforcement or defense of our issued patents, thereby impairing our ability to protect our technologies and current or future products.\nAs is the case with other life sciences companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the life\nsciences industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in\ninterpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the\nenforcement or defense of issued patents.\nFor example, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “America Invents Act”), was signed into law on September 16, 2011, and many of the substantive changes became\neffective on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications\nand the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nSpecifically, the America Invents Act reforms United States patent law in part by changing the U.S. patent system from a “first to invent” system to a “first inventor to file”\nsystem. Under a “first inventor to file” system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled\nto the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor was the first to invent the invention. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from\ninvention to filing of a patent application and be diligent in filing patent applications. Circumstances may arise that could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on\nour inventions and allow third parties to file patents claiming our inventions before we are able to do so. The America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes\nthat affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during\npatent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by the USPTO administered post grant proceedings, including reexamination proceedings, inter\npartes review, post grant review and derivation proceedings. These adversarial proceedings at the USPTO review patent claims without the presumption of validity afforded to\nU.S. patents in lawsuits in U.S. federal courts, and use a lower burden of proof than used in litigation in U.S. federal courts. Therefore, it is generally considered easier for a\ncompetitor or third party to have a U.S. patent invalidated in a USPTO post-grant review or inter partes review proceeding than in a litigation in a U.S. federal court.\nIn addition, the patent positions of companies in the life sciences industry are particularly uncertain. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent\nprotection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to\nthe validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations\ngoverning patents could change in unpredictable ways. In addition, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws have also increased in recent years. Complying with\nthese laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by\ngovernmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and patent applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various\ngovernment patent agencies outside the United States over the lifetime of our patents and patent applications and any patent rights we may own or license in the future.\nAdditionally, the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside the United States require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and\nother similar provisions during the patent application process. In certain cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with\nrules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application,\nresulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering or otherwise\nprotecting our current or future products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, to the extent that we have responsibility for taking any action\nrelated to the prosecution or maintenance of patents or patent applications in-licensed from a third party, any failure on our part to maintain the in-licensed intellectual property\ncould jeopardize our rights under the relevant license and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nprospects.\n47\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees, consultants, independent contractors or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or\nclaiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property and proprietary technology.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other life science, biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential\ncompetitors. We try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us. We may, however, be subject to claims that\nwe or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary information of any such employee’s former\nemployer or that patents and applications we have filed to protect inventions of these individuals, even those related to one or more of our current or future products, are\nrightfully owned by their former or concurrent employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending ourselves, such\nlitigation could result in substantial costs to us or be distracting to our management. If we fail to defend any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose\nvaluable intellectual property rights or personnel or we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license\nmay not be available on an exclusive basis or on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and independent contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute\nagreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we\nregard as our own, or such agreements may be breached or alleged to be ineffective, and the assignment may not be self-executing, which may result in claims by or against us\nrelated to the ownership of such intellectual property or may result in such intellectual property becoming assigned to third parties. If we fail in enforcing or defending any such\nclaims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims,\nlitigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our senior management and scientific personnel. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on current or future products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries\nmay not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, patent scope or coverage varies between countries based on the differences between\nthe respective patent laws in each country or jurisdiction. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the\nUnited States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Third parties may use our technologies in\njurisdictions where we have not obtained or are unable to adequately enforce patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing\nproducts to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our\npatents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries,\nparticularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to\nbiotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property\nand proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our\nefforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not\nissuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may\nnot be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant\ncommercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the\nenforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially\ndiminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive\nposition may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on confidentiality agreements that, if breached, may be difficult to enforce and could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position.\nOur policy is to enter agreements relating to the non-disclosure and non-use of confidential information with third parties, including our contractors, consultants, advisors and\nresearch collaborators, as well as agreements that purport to require the disclosure and assignment to us of the rights to the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions of\nour employees and consultants while we employ them. However, these agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce. Moreover, to the extent that our contractors,\nconsultants, advisors and research collaborators apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects, disputes may arise as to the\nproprietary rights to the intellectual property. If a dispute arises, a court may determine that the right belongs to a third party, and enforcement of our rights can be costly and\nunpredictable. In addition, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, contractors,\nconsultants, advisors or others. Despite the protective measures we employ, we still face the risk that:\n• these agreements may be breached;\n• these agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach; or\n• our trade secrets or proprietary know-how will otherwise become known.\nAny breach of our confidentiality agreements or our failure to effectively enforce such agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive\nposition.\nIf our trademarks, trade dress, and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur trademarks, trade dress, or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able\nto protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names or marks which we need for name recognition by potential partners or\ncustomers in our markets of interest. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we would be given an opportunity to respond to those\nrejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an\nopportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks,\nand our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete\neffectively and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects may be adversely affected.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our proprietary and intellectual property rights is uncertain because such rights offer only limited protection and may not adequately\nprotect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n• others may be able to develop products that are similar to, or better than, our current or future products in a way that is not covered by the claims of the patents we\nlicense or may own currently or in the future;\n• we, or our licensing partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by issued patents or pending patent\napplications that we license or may own currently or in the future;\n• we, or our licensing partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications for certain of our or their inventions;\n• our pending owned or in-licensed patent applications may not lead to issued patents;\n• we may choose not to file a patent for certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property;\n• our competitors or other third parties might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information\nlearned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n• it is possible that there are prior public disclosures that could invalidate our or our licensors’ patents;\n49\nTable of Contents\n• the patents of third parties or pending or future applications of third parties, if issued, may have an adverse effect on our business;\n• any patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may ultimately be found not to be owned by us, invalid or unenforceable; or\n• we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, financial conditions, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur existing level of indebtedness may increase and adversely affect our business and growth prospects, growth prospects, and financial condition, as well as our ability to\nraise additional capital on favorable terms, which could, in turn, limit our ability to develop or acquire new products, services, technologies and methodologies.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total current and long-term indebtedness outstanding of approximately $524.1 million, including term loans of $533.1 million, and\nunamortized debt issuance costs of $9.0 million. We may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. If we increase our current indebtedness levels, the risks related\nto our indebtedness as set forth herein could intensify.\nOur indebtedness, or any additional indebtedness we may incur, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. If\nwe cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain necessary funds. We\ndo not know whether we will be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all.\nOur indebtedness, the cash flow needed to satisfy our debt and the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement have important consequences, including:\n• limiting funds otherwise available for financing our capital expenditures by requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt\nand the interest on this debt;\n• limiting our ability to incur or prepay existing indebtedness, pay dividends or distributions, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or\nother investments and make changes in the nature of the business, among other things;\n• making us more vulnerable to rising interest rates, as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement, bear variable rates of interest; and\n• making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business.\nOur level of indebtedness may place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing\ncosts. Increases in interest rates may directly impact the amount of interest we are required to pay and reduce earnings accordingly. In addition, tax laws, including the\ndisallowance or deferral of tax deductions for interest paid on outstanding indebtedness, could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, cash flows and prospects. Further, our Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain restrictions on operations that\ncould impose operating and financial limitations and restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to enter into particular transactions and to engage in other actions that\nwe may believe are advisable or necessary for our business.\nVariable rate indebtedness that we have incurred or may in the future incur will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase\nsignificantly.\nCertain borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear variable rates of interest. Increase in interest rates directly increase the amount of interest we are required to pay, and\nnegatively impacts our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness more generally.\n50\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt service obligations, which\nactions may not be adequate or may impose additional restrictions on us.\nOur ability to make scheduled debt service payments or to refinance outstanding debt obligations depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to\nprevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and certain financial, business, economic and other factors beyond our control, including those discussed under\n“Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy” above. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal,\npremium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If we cannot meet our debt service obligations, the holders of our indebtedness would have the right to accelerate such\nindebtedness and, to the extent such indebtedness is secured, foreclose on our assets. This could have serious consequences to our business, financial condition and results of\noperations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent. Even if this does not occur, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding\nindebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our creditworthiness, which would also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures and acquisitions, sell\nassets, raise additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we issue additional equity to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness, our shareholders\nmay experience significant dilution of their equity interests. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more\nonerous covenants, including the requirement to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If these\nalternative measures are not successful, we may be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service obligations. Further, we may not be able to\nconsummate these asset sales (including as a result of restrictions imposed on us under the Credit Agreement) or sell assets at prices and on terms that we believe are fair, and\nany proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nThe terms of the financing documents governing our Credit Agreement restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take\ncertain actions.\nThe financing documents governing our Credit Agreement contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may\nlimit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:\n• incur additional indebtedness;\n• incur liens;\n• merge, dissolve, liquidate, amalgamate, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n• declare or pay certain dividends, payments or distribution or repurchase or redeem certain capital stock;\n• permit our subsidiaries to enter into agreements restricting their ability to pay dividends, make loans, incur liens and sell assets; and\n• make certain investments.\nThese restrictions could limit, potentially significantly, our operational flexibility and affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute our\nbusiness strategy.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nOur principal asset is our interest in Maravai Topco Holdings LLC (“Topco LLC”), and, accordingly, we depend on distributions from Topco LLC to pay our taxes and\nexpenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Topco LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of equity interests in Topco LLC. As such, we have no independent means of generating\nrevenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes, satisfy our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay operating expenses or declare and pay dividends, if\nany, in the future depends on the financial results and cash flows of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from Topco LLC. There can be no assurance\nthat Topco LLC and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative\ncovenants in debt instruments of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries, will permit such distributions.\n51\nTable of Contents\nTopco LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. For U.S. federal income tax\npurposes, taxable income of Topco LLC is allocated to the LLC Unitholders of Topco LLC, including us. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our distributive share of any\nnet taxable income of Topco LLC. Under the terms of the Topco LLC operating agreement (the “LLC Operating Agreement”), Topco LLC is obligated to make tax distributions\nto LLC Unitholders, including us. In addition to tax and dividend payments, we also incur expenses related to our operations, including obligations to make payments under the\nTax Receivable Agreement. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot estimate the likely tax benefits we may realize as a result of our purchase of LLC Units in\nTopco LLC (the “LLC Units”) and LLC Unit exchanges, and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to LLC Unitholders pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement;\nhowever, such payments may be substantial. Under the LLC Operating Agreement, tax distributions shall be made on a pro rata basis among the LLC Unitholders, and will be\ncalculated without regard to any applicable basis adjustment under Section 743(b) of The Internal Revenue Code (“the Code”).\nWe expect Topco LLC will continue to make cash distributions to the owners of LLC Units in amounts sufficient to (1) fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of\ntaxable income allocated to them and (2) cover our operating expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nHowever, Topco LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would violate either\nany contract or agreement to which Topco LLC or its subsidiaries is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering\nTopco LLC or its subsidiaries insolvent. In addition, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, liability for adjustments to a partnership’s tax return may be\nimputed on the partnership itself in certain circumstances, absent an election to the contrary. Topco LLC may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this legislation and\nrelated guidance if, for example, its calculations of taxable income are incorrect. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations, we\nmay have to borrow funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To\nthe extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. Nonpayment\nfor a specified period, however, may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement, unless, generally, such nonpayment is due to a lack of sufficient funds.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions we determine. Although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to\nchallenge existing tax basis, a tax basis increase or other tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, if any subsequent disallowance of tax basis or other benefits\nwere so determined by the IRS, we would not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the applicable Tax Receivable Agreement (although we would reduce\nfuture amounts otherwise payable under such Tax Receivable Agreement). In addition, the actual state or local tax savings we realize may be different than the amount of such\ntax savings we are deemed to realize under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which will be based on an assumed combined state and local tax rate applied to our reduction in\ntaxable income as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, payments could be\nmade under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of the tax savings we realize in respect of the attributes to which the Tax Receivable Agreement relate.\nConflicts of interest could arise between our shareholders and Maravai Life Sciences Holdings, LLC (“MLSH 1”), which may impede business decisions that could benefit\nour shareholders.\nMLSH 1, which is controlled by GTCR, LLC (“GTCR”) and is the only holder of LLC Units other than us, has the right to consent to certain amendments to the LLC Operating\nAgreement, as well as to certain other matters. MLSH 1 may exercise these voting rights in a manner that conflicts with the interests of our shareholders. Circumstances may\narise in the future when the interests of MLSH 1 conflict with the interests of our shareholders. As we control Topco LLC, we have certain obligations to MLSH 1 as an LLC\nUnitholder in Topco LLC that may conflict with fiduciary duties our officers and directors owe to our shareholders. These conflicts may result in decisions that are not in the\nbest interests of shareholders.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement requires us to make cash payments to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and we\nexpect that the payments we may be required to make could be substantial.\nPursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement we are required to make cash payments to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we\nactually realize, or, in some circumstances, are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) certain increases in the tax basis of assets of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from\npurchases or exchanges of LLC Units, (ii) certain tax attributes related to the LLC Units held by the corporations that merged into our corporate structure as part of the\nOrganizational Transactions (as discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements), Topco LLC and subsidiaries of Topco LLC that existed prior to our initial public\noffering and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments that we make under the Tax\n52\nTable of Contents\nReceivable Agreement. Any payments made by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that\nmight have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, such payments generally will be deferred\nand will accrue interest until paid. Nonpayment for a specified period, however, may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement and\ntherefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, unless, generally, such nonpayment is due to a lack of sufficient funds. Furthermore, our future\nobligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use\nsome or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also not conditioned\nupon MLSH 1 maintaining a continued ownership interest in Topco LLC.\nEstimating the amount and timing of our realization of tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise. The actual amount and timing of any\npayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges by MLSH 1, the amount of gain recognized by\nMLSH 1, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the federal tax rates then applicable. Accordingly, estimating the amount and timing of\npayments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreement is also by its nature imprecise.\nWe expect that the aggregate payments that we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be substantial. Assuming no material changes in the relevant\ntax law, we expect that probable future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement relating to the purchase by Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. of LLC Units from\nMLSH 1 and the corresponding tax attributes to be approximately $7.1 million. This determination is based on our estimate of taxable income for the year ended December 31,\n2023. Future payments in respect of subsequent exchanges or financings and tax attributes relating to the purchase by the Company of LLC Units from MLSH 1 would be in\naddition to this amount and may be substantial. The foregoing numbers are merely estimates—the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions\nor events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments. There may be a material negative effect on our\nliquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax\nattributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and/or distributions to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. by Topco LLC are not sufficient to permit Maravai LifeSciences\nHoldings, Inc. to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement after it has paid taxes.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine. Although we are not aware of any issue that would cause the\nInternal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to challenge a tax basis increase or the availability of tax attributes of the corporations merged into our corporate structure as part of the\nOrganizational Transactions, if any, we will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement if\nany tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently disallowed, in whole or in part, by the IRS or other applicable taxing authority. For example, if the IRS later asserts that\nwe did not obtain a tax basis increase or disallows (in whole or in part) the availability of Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”) due to a potential ownership change under Section\n382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC” or “the Code”), among other potential challenges, then we would not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to MLSH\n1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement with respect to such tax benefits that we had initially claimed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us pursuant\nto the Tax Receivable Agreement will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable\nAgreement. Nevertheless, any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not be disallowed for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged\nearly, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivable\nAgreement. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient future cash payments against which to net. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex, and there can be no\nassurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement liability is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as a contingent liability under ASC 450, “Liabilities,” and reflects management’s\nassessment that positive future taxable income and realization of cash tax savings are probable. Management’s assessment of whether payment of the Tax Receivable\nAgreement liability is probable is generally based on the determination as to whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. We evaluate the\nrealizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establish valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not\nbe realized. As of December 31, 2023, we established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and derecognized the remaining non-current liability under the\nTax Receivable Agreement after concluding it was not probable that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets that would result in\npayments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If revised forecasts of our future taxable income or other relevant factors result in us releasing all or a portion of the\nvaluation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets applicable to the aforementioned tax attributes in a future period, the remaining Tax Receivable Agreement liability\nmay be\n53\nTable of Contents\nconsidered probable at that time and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and within earnings. It is impossible to predict when and to what extent, if at all, such valuation\nallowance will be released, and therefore whether we would again be required to recognize all or a portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability, which would adversely\nimpact our future results of operations, possibly in a material manner.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to provide MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 with a schedule setting forth the calculation of payments that are due under the TRA\nwith respect to each taxable year in which a payment obligation arises within ninety (90) days after the extended due date of our U.S. federal income tax return for such taxable\nyear. This calculation will be based upon the advice of our tax advisors. The calculation will become final thirty (30) days after it is provided assuming that no objections are\nmade. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally be made within five (5) business days after this schedule becomes final pursuant to the procedures set forth\nin the Tax Receivable Agreement. Interest on such payments will begin to accrue at a rate of Intercontinental Exchange London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) for a period of\none month (or, if LIBOR ceases to be published, at a rate selected by us in good faith, with characteristics similar to LIBOR or consistent with market practices generally, any\nsuch rate, a “Replacement Rate”) plus 100 basis points from the due date (without extensions) of such tax return. Generally, any late payments that may be made under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement will continue to accrue interest at LIBOR (or a Replacement Rate, as applicable) plus 500 basis points until such payments are made, including any late\npayments that we may subsequently make because we did not have enough available cash to satisfy our payment obligations at the time at which they originally arose. Given\nthe cessation of LIBOR, we have transitioned to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the applicable Replacement Rate as allowable under the Tax Receivable\nAgreement.\nThe amounts that we may be required to pay to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated in certain circumstances and may also\nsignificantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that if (1) certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination or other changes of control were to occur, (2) we breach\nany of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or (3) at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then the Tax Receivable\nAgreement will terminate and our obligations, or our successor’s obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would accelerate and become\nimmediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in that circumstance is based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable\nincome to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or\notherwise.\nAs a result of a change in control, material breach or our election to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, (1) we could be required to make cash payments to MLSH 1\nand MLSH 2 that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable\nAgreement and (2) we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement\ndiscounted in accordance with the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits.\nIn these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying,\ndeferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance\nour obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 that will not benefit the other common\nshareholders to the same extent as they will benefit MLSH 1 and MLSH 2.\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon MLSH 1, as the only other LLC Unitholder in Topco LLC, and MLSH 2\nthat will not benefit the other holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent. We have entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, which\nwill provide for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are\ndeemed to realize, as a result of (i) certain increases in the tax basis of assets of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from purchases or exchanges of LLC Units, (ii) certain\ntax attributes of certain of the entities through which GTCR and other existing members of MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 held their ownership interests in MLSH 1, Topco LLC and\nsubsidiaries of Topco LLC that existed prior to our initial public offering and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including\ntax benefits attributable to payments that we make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot estimate the likely tax benefits we\nwill realize as a result of purchases of LLC Units and LLC Unit exchanges, and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the Tax\nReceivable Agreement; however, we estimate that such payments may be substantial. Although\n54\nTable of Contents\nwe will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for the Class A\ncommon stock.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are currently expected to result from the tax attributes covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement and\nfrom payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nOur ability to realize the tax benefits that we currently expect to be available as a result of the attributes covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement, the payments made pursuant\nto the Tax Receivable Agreement, and the interest deductions imputed under the Tax Receivable Agreement all depend on a number of assumptions, including that we earn\nsufficient taxable income each year during the period over which such deductions are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations.\nAdditionally, if our actual taxable income were insufficient or there were additional adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a\nportion of the expected tax benefits and our cash flows and shareholders’ equity could be negatively affected.\nIn certain circumstances, Topco LLC will be required to make distributions to us and MLSH 1 and the distributions may be substantial.\nTopco LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to its\nmembers, including us. We expect Topco LLC will continue to make tax distributions quarterly to the LLC Unitholders in Topco LLC (including us), in each case on a pro rata\nbasis based on Topco LLC’s net taxable income and without regard to any applicable basis adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code. Funds used by Topco LLC to satisfy\nits tax distribution obligations will not be available for reinvestment in our business. Moreover, these tax distributions may be substantial, and will likely exceed (as a\npercentage of Topco LLC’s income) the overall effective tax rate applicable to a similarly situated corporate taxpayer. As a result, it is possible that we will receive distributions\nsignificantly in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. While our Board may choose to distribute such cash\nbalances as dividends on our Class A common stock, they will not be required to do so, and may in their sole discretion choose to use such excess cash for any purpose\n(including an investment of such cash into Topco LLC) depending upon the facts and circumstances at the time of determination. See “Dividend Policy.”\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results\nand financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future\neffective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n• changes in the amount and realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n• changes in any tax valuation allowances;\n• expiration of, or detrimental changes in, research and development tax credit laws; or\n• changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state and foreign authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an\nadverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act if it (1) is, or holds itself\nout as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (2) is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the\nbusiness of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of\nits total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an “investment company,” as such term is\ndefined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\nAs the sole managing member of Topco LLC, we will control and manage Topco LLC. On that basis, we believe that our interest in Topco LLC is not an “investment security”\nunder the 1940 Act. Therefore, we have less than 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) in “investment securities.”\nHowever, if we were to lose the\n55\nTable of Contents\nright to manage and control Topco LLC, interests in Topco LLC could be deemed to be “investment securities” under the 1940 Act.\nWe intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed to be an investment company. However, if we were deemed to be an investment company, restrictions\nimposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as\ncontemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nRisks Related to Being a Public Company\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in order to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We\nmay not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or to the extent these internal controls are determined by us or our\nauditors to not be operating effectively, investor confidence in us and the value of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Developing the system and\nprocessing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is a costly and challenging process. If we are\nunable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which\ncould cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. This assessment must be made yearly and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. We also must disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis. Further, our independent registered public accounting firm\nmust report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our independent registered public accounting\nfirm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating, which could cause the price of\nour Class A common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nAdditionally, the existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any\nsuch material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in a timely manner.\nThe existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our\nfinancial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause shareholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nGTCR controls us, and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2023, investment entities affiliated with GTCR collectively controlled approximately 56% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and\ntherefore GTCR controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders. This control enables GTCR to control the election of the members of the Board and\nall other corporate decisions. Even when GTCR ceases to control a majority of the total voting power, for so long as GTCR continues to own a significant percentage of our\nClass A common stock, GTCR will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our Board and the approval of actions requiring shareholder approval.\nAccordingly, for such period of time, GTCR will have significant influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal\nof our officers, decisions on whether to raise future capital and amending our charter and bylaws, which govern the rights attached to our Class A common stock. In particular,\nfor so long as GTCR continues to own a significant percentage of our Class A common stock, GTCR will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of us or a change in the\ncomposition of our Board and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of us. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for\nyour shares of Class A common stock as part of a sale of us and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe entered into a Director Nomination Agreement with GTCR that provides GTCR the right to nominate to the Board a number of designees equal to at least: (i) 100% of the\ntotal number of directors comprising the Board, so long as GTCR\n56\nTable of Contents\nbeneficially owns shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock representing at least 40% of the total amount of shares of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock it beneficially owned as of November 19, 2020, (ii) 40% of the total number of directors, in the event that GTCR beneficially owns shares of Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock representing at least 30% but less than 40% of the total amount of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock it owned as of\nNovember 19, 2020, (iii) 30% of the total number of directors, in the event that GTCR beneficially owns shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock\nrepresenting at least 20% but less than 30% of the total amount of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock it owned as of November 19, 2020, (iv) 20% of\nthe total number of directors, in the event that GTCR beneficially owns shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock representing at least 10% but less than\n20% of the total amount of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock it owns as of November 19, 2020 and (v) one director, in the event that GTCR\nbeneficially owns shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock representing at least 5% of the total amount of shares of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock it owned as of November 19, 2020. The Director Nomination Agreement provides that GTCR may assign such right to a GTCR affiliate. The Director\nNomination Agreement prohibits us from increasing or decreasing the size of our Board without the prior written consent of GTCR.\nGTCR and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in our industry generally. In the ordinary course of their business activities, GTCR and\nits affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our other shareholders, such as investing in or advising businesses that directly\nor indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours. Our certificate of incorporation provides that none of GTCR, any of its\naffiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or\nits affiliates has any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate.\nGTCR also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In\naddition, GTCR may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such\ntransactions might involve risks to you or may not prove beneficial.\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of NASDAQ and, as a result, we qualify for and rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance\nrequirements. You will not have the same protections as those afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such governance requirements.\nCurrently, GTCR controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate\ngovernance requirements of NASDAQ. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group\nor another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ, including:\n• the requirement that a majority of our Board is composed of “independent directors” as defined under NASDAQ rules;\n• the requirement that we have a nominations committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n• the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nFrom time to time, we may rely on these exceptions. Although a majority of our Board is currently composed of independent directors, neither our Compensation and\nLeadership Development Committee, nor our Nominating, Governance and Risk Committee, consists entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you may not have the\nsame protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.\nProvisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our\ncurrent management, even if beneficial to our shareholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to\nacquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. Among other things:\n• these provisions allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued\nwithout shareholder approval, and which may include supermajority voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of\nshareholders;\n• these provisions provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n• these provisions provide that, at any time when GTCR controls, in the aggregate, less than 40% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, directors may\nonly be removed for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of\n57\nTable of Contents\nholders of at least 66 2⁄3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class;\n• these provisions prohibit shareholder action by written consent from and after the date on which GTCR controls, in the aggregate, less than 35% in voting power of our\nstock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors;\n• these provisions provide that for as long as GTCR controls, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of\ndirectors, any amendment, alteration, rescission or repeal of our bylaws by our shareholders will require the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the\noutstanding shares of our capital stock and at any time when GTCR controls, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting power of all outstanding shares of our stock\nentitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any amendment, alteration, rescission or repeal of our bylaws by our shareholders will require the affirmative vote\nof the holders of at least 66 2⁄3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and\n• these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at\nshareholder meetings; provided, however, at any time when GTCR controls, in the aggregate, at least 10% in voting power of our stock entitled to vote generally in the\nelection of directors, such advance notice procedure will not apply to GTCR.\nWe opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any\ninterested shareholder for a period of three years following the date on which the shareholder became an interested shareholder. However, our certificate of incorporation\ncontains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203, and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person (excluding GTCR and any\nof its direct or indirect transferees and any group as to which such persons are a party) who acquires at least 85% of our Class A common stock for a period of three years from\nthe date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or shareholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition. These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent\na transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to\nelect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire, including actions that you may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price\nof our Class A common stock. In addition, because our Board is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any\nattempt by our shareholders to replace current members of our management team.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of\nour Board or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board, including actions to delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company.\nThe existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our\nshareholders and the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forum for litigation arising under the Securities Act, which could limit our shareholders’\nability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and\nexclusive forum for any claims in state court for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty\nowed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our shareholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL,\nour certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that for the avoidance\nof doubt, the forum selection provision that identifies the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation, including any “derivative\naction,” will not apply to suits to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”) or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that, unless we consent\nin writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause\nof action arising under the Securities Act. Our certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of\nour capital stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. The forum selection provisions in our certificate\nof incorporation may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors and officers and may limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum\nfor disputes with us. If the enforceability of our forum selection provisions were to be challenged, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such challenge. While\nwe currently have no basis to expect any such challenge would be successful, if a court were to find our forum selection provisions to be\n58\nTable of Contents\ninapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of these specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with having to litigate in\nother jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects and result in a diversion of the time\nand resources of our employees, management and board of directors.\nOur stock price may be volatile for reasons unrelated to our operating performance and financial condition.\nCapital markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant volatility, including as a result of the current challenging macroeconomic\nenvironment, fiscal and monetary policy uncertainty, as well as political instability and continued or worsening hostilities or military conflicts in certain regions. This market\nvolatility, as well as other general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the trading price of our Class A common stock to wide price fluctuations regardless of\nour underlying operating performance and financial position.\nIf our existing investors sell a significant portion of our total outstanding shares of Class A common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock could drop\nsignificantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time. As of December 31, 2023, we had 132,227,632 outstanding\nshares of Class A common stock, 21,681,033 of which held by MLSH 2, and further, as of December 31, 2023, an additional 119,094,026 shares of Class A common stock are\nissuable upon the exchange by MLSH 1 of its interest in Topco. Because each of MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 is controlled by GTCR and is considered an “affiliate” of ours, the\nshares of Class A common stock held by MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 are subject to certain restrictions on resale imposed by U.S. federal securities laws. However, pursuant to a\nregistration rights agreement, MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 have the right to request that we register these shares in which case the shares would be able to be freely sold in the public\nmarket without such restrictions. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of Class A common stock intend to sell shares, could\nreduce the market price of our Class A common stock.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay regular cash dividends on our Class A common, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A\ncommon stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe do not anticipate paying any regular cash dividends on our Class A common stock. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of\nour Board and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board\nmay deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is, and may be, limited by covenants of existing and any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries\nincur. Therefore, any return on investment in our Class A common stock is solely dependent upon the appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock on the open\nmarket, which may not occur.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our\nClass A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative\nrights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our\nshareholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance\nof preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially adversely\naffect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nOur cybersecurity risk management processes include technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems, contractual arrangements, tools and\nrelated services, and management oversight to assess, identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats. We implement risk-based controls to protect our information,\ninformation systems, business operations, and products and related services. We have adopted security-control principles based on the National Institute of\n59\nTable of Contents\nStandards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST), other global standards, and contractual requirements, as applicable. We also leverage government partnerships,\nindustry and government associations, third-party benchmarking, audits, threat intelligence feeds, and other similar resources to inform our cybersecurity efforts and allocate\nresources.\nWe maintain an information security program that includes physical, administrative and technical safeguards, and we maintain plans and procedures whose objective is to help\nus prevent and timely and effectively respond to cybersecurity incidents. Through our cybersecurity risk management process, we continuously monitor cybersecurity\nvulnerabilities and potential attack vectors and evaluate the potential operational and financial effects of cybersecurity risk countermeasures made to defend against such\nthreats. This process has been integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management program and our Compliance Risk Management program, both of which are overseen by our\nBoard of Directors. In addition, we engage third-party consultants to assist us in assessing, enhancing, implementing, and monitoring our cybersecurity risk management\nprograms, including conducting penetration testing, phishing campaigns, and vulnerability assessments, and responding to any incidents.\nWe also assess the risks from cybersecurity threats of our suppliers and third-party service providers. We also require our suppliers and third-party service providers to adopt\nsecurity-control principles based on NIST or similar global standards.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, whether directly or through our supply chain or other channels, cybersecurity incidents. While prior incidents have not\nhad a material impact on us, future incidents could have a material impact on our business, operations, and reputation. Although our cybersecurity risk management processes\nare designed to help prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate the impact of such incidents, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the risk of a\ncyberattack or the potentially serious reputational, operational, legal or financial impacts that may result. See “Our internal computer systems, or those of our customers,\ncollaborators or other contractors, have been and may in the future be subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product\ndevelopment programs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects” within Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOur Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight. Oversight of certain of the Company’s key risks is specifically allocated to Board committees based on their respective\nareas of expertise. The Nominating, Governance and Risk Committee assists the Board in overseeing risks specific to cybersecurity. Pursuant to its written charter, the\nNominating, Governance and Risk Committee is charged with overseeing our management’s efforts to identify, evaluate and mitigate major risks related to cybersecurity, data\nprotection controls, business continuity/disaster recovery systems and other information security matters, and periodically reviews our approach to the identification, evaluation\nand mitigation of such risks with the Board. Our Vice President, Information Technology (“VP of IT”), together with our General Counsel, briefs the Nominating, Governance\nand Risk Committee on cybersecurity risks at selected meetings. These briefings include assessments of the threat landscape, updates on incidents, and reports on our\ninvestments in cybersecurity risk mitigation and governance. To the extent that a significant cybersecurity event occurs, the Nominating, Governance and Risk Committee\nwould also receive periodic updates from senior management, including the VP of IT, the General Counsel, and the relevant Company third-party consultants on any significant\ncybersecurity events. Such updates would include, as applicable and relevant, the nature, scope and timing of the event; the type and scale of information or data has been\naccessed, exfiltrated or encrypted; the systems involved; what is known about the threat actor, such as capabilities and demands, if any; management’s ongoing assessment of\nthe impacts or likely impacts of the intrusion; the possibility of litigation or regulatory investigations or actions; and any other information that management finds relevant and\nthat would aid in the assessment of the materiality of the impact of the intrusion.\nOur Information Technology (IT) Department and Legal Department work together and are jointly responsible for developing and coordinating our enterprise-wide\ncybersecurity policy and strategy, including managing our cybersecurity risk management processes. The VP of IT and the General Counsel report to the Company’s senior\nleadership team on progress towards specific cybersecurity objectives.\nVijay Mani is our VP of IT. He is responsible for managing our information security, developing cybersecurity strategy, and implementing effective information and\ncybersecurity programs. Mr. Mani has 16 years of experience working in leadership roles in information technology, as well as relevant degrees and certifications, including an\nAdvanced Computer Security Certificate from Stanford University. He reports directly to our Chief Financial Officer and meets periodically with the Nominating, Governance\nand Risk Committee.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters and certain of our research and development operations are located in San Diego, California. The facilities serve as the principal hub of operations\nfor our nucleic acid production business and were purpose built to expand the capacity of this business segment while adding specialized capabilities in the form of clean rooms,\nair handling, waste and\n60\nTable of Contents\nsolvent handling, and GMP capabilities. Our facility leases expire at varying dates through 2038, not including renewals that are at our option.\nAll facilities are leased. A summary of our facilities is listed below.\nLocation Approx.

Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and\nclaims are inherently unpredictable and uncertain, we are not currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, are believed to,\neither individually or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, litigation\nhas the potential to have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our audited consolidated financial statements and related\nnotes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis reflects our historical consolidated results of operations and financial position, and\ncontain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by these forward-looking\nstatements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” Please also see the\nsection titled “Forward Looking Statements.” We were incorporated in August 2020 and, pursuant to the organizational transactions described in Note 1 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements, became a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Topco LLC. As the sole managing member of Topco LLC, we operate\nand control the business and affairs of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, we consolidate Topco LLC in our consolidated financial statements and report a non-\ncontrolling interest related to the portion of Topco LLC not owned by us. Because the organizational transactions were considered transactions between entities under common\ncontrol, the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the organizational transactions and the initial public offering have been adjusted to combine the previously\nseparate entities for presentation purposes. Unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we,” “us” or “our”\nrefer to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThis discussion and analysis generally addresses 2023 and 2022 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-over-year\ncomparisons between 2022 and 2021 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed\nwith the SEC on February 28, 2023.\n63\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nWe are a leading life sciences company providing critical products to enable the development of drug therapies, diagnostics, novel vaccines and support research on human\ndiseases. Our customers include the top global biopharmaceutical companies ranked by research and development expenditures according to industry consultants, and many\nother emerging biopharmaceutical and life sciences research companies, as well as leading academic research institutions and in vitro diagnostics companies. Our products\naddress the key phases of biopharmaceutical development and include complex nucleic acids for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, antibody-based products to detect\nimpurities during the production of biopharmaceutical products, and products to detect the expression of proteins in tissues of various species.\nWe have and will continue to build a transformative life sciences products company by acquiring businesses and accelerating their growth through capital infusions and industry\nexpertise. Biomedical innovation is dependent on a reliable supply of reagents in the fields of nucleic acid production, biologics safety testing and protein labeling. From\ninventive startups to the world’s leading biopharmaceutical, vaccine, diagnostics and gene and cell therapy companies, these customers turn to us to solve their complex\ndiscovery challenges and help them streamline and scale their supply chain needs beginning from research and development through clinical trials to commercialization.\nOur primary customers are biopharmaceutical companies who are pursuing novel research and product development programs. Our customers also include a range of\ngovernment, academic and biotechnology institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed a team of over 650 employees, approximately 24% of whom have advanced degrees. As of January 5, 2024, following the completion\nof a reduction in force (as described under “Restructuring” below), we had approximately 570 employees, approximately 25% of whom have advanced degrees.\nWe primarily utilize a direct sales model for our sales to our customers in North America. Our international sales, primarily in Europe and Asia Pacific, are effected through a\ncombination of third-party distributors as well as via a direct sales model. The percentage of our total revenue derived from customers in North America was 48.8% and 38.4%\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe generated revenue of $288.9 million and $883.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTotal revenue by segment was $224.8 million in Nucleic Acid Production and $64.2 million in Biologics Safety Testing for the year ended December 31, 2023. Total revenue\nby segment was $813.1 million in Nucleic Acid Production and $69.9 million in Biologics Safety Testing for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe focus a substantial portion of our resources supporting our core business segments. We are actively pursuing opportunities to expand our customer base both domestically\nand internationally by fostering strong relationships with both existing and new customers and distributors. Our management team has experience working with\nbiopharmaceutical, vaccine, diagnostics and gene and cell therapy companies as well as academic and research scientists. We also intend to continue making investments in our\noverall infrastructure and business segments to support our growth. We incurred aggregate selling, general, and administrative expenses of $151.4 million and $129.3 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur research and development efforts are geared towards meeting our customers’ needs. We incurred research and development expenses of $17.3 million and $18.4 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We intend to continue to invest in research and development and new products and technologies to support our\ncustomers’ needs for the foreseeable future.\n2023 and Recent Developments\nAcquisition\nIn January 2023, we completed the acquisition of Alphazyme, LLC (“Alphazyme”), a privately-held original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and provider of custom,\nscalable, molecular biology enzymes to customers in the genetic analysis and nucleic acid synthesis markets, for a total purchase consideration of $75.3 million. As a result of\nthe acquisition, we own all the outstanding equity interest in Alphazyme. Our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 include the operating\nresults of Alphazyme from the acquisition date. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRestructuring\nIn November 2023, the Company implemented a cost realignment plan (the “Cost Realignment Plan”) that included the termination of approximately 15% of the Company’s\nworkforce, the termination of certain leases, and other actions to reduce expenses, all as part of a plan to optimize business operations and match them to current market\nconditions. The reduction in\n64\nTable of Contents\nforce was completed on January 5, 2024, following the end of the sixty-day notification period required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The\nCompany expects the remaining actions under the Cost Realignment Plan to be substantially complete during the first quarter of 2024.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred restructuring costs of $6.5 million, primarily related to severance and other employee-related costs, facility and other\nexit costs, professional fees and other restructuring costs. We do not expect to incur any additional restructuring costs, however, we expect to recognize a benefit of $1.2 million\nduring the first quarter of 2024 relating to equity award forfeitures associated with employee terminations. We expect the Cost Realignment Plan to yield certain cost savings of\napproximately $30.0 million annually, of which $23.0 million relates to labor costs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nCOVID-19 Related Revenue Trends and Uncertainties\nOur results of operations and cash flows during each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 substantially benefited from the demand for COVID-19 related\nproducts and services, including our proprietary CleanCap® analogs and highly modified RNA products, particularly mRNA, which are used by our customers in the production\nof COVID-19 vaccines. As a result of the general decrease in market demand for COVID-19 related products and services, including the supply and manufacture of COVID-19\nvaccines, and in particular, following the end of U.S. federal public health emergency declaration and World Health Organization declaration of the end of the pandemic in early\nMay 2022, we expect to experience further declines in COVID-19 related revenue, as discussed in further detail below.\nWe estimate that revenue from COVID-19 related products and services represented approximately 21.0% and 67.9% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe that the second quarter of 2022 will have represented the highest revenue quarter for revenue attributable to our COVID-19 related\nproducts and services, and have experienced substantial declines in COVID-19 related revenue since such quarter as a result of the general market trend of reduced demand for\nCOVID-19 related products and services as the pandemic subsides, including the supply and manufacture of COVID-19 related vaccines, and the World Health Organization\ndeclaring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect further declines in COVID-19 related revenue for these reasons, as well as a result of unused inventory of our products\nthat our customers have on hand. We are currently unable to fully estimate the impact of this unused inventory on our future COVID-19 related revenue, nor are we able to\npredict when our customers will resume purchasing COVID-19 related products given that our customers generally have not provided us with detailed inventory data. Our\nlonger-term revenue prospects for COVID-19 related products are highly uncertain but are expected to be substantially less than pandemic highs. The factors that could\ninfluence longer-term COVID-19 related revenue include: the emergence, duration and intensity of new virus variants; regional resurgences of the virus globally; competition\nfaced by our customers from other COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers and the development and availability of antiviral therapeutic alternatives; the availability and\nadministration of pediatric and booster vaccinations, vaccine supply constraints, vaccine hesitancy and the effectiveness of vaccines against new virus strains; and the U.S.\neconomy and global economy, including impacts resulting from supply chain constraints, labor market shortages and inflationary pressures. This contraction in COVID-19\nrelated demand will significantly decrease our revenue and cash flow, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition in the\nfuture.\nOther Trends and Uncertainties\nWhile we believe that the long-term trend of biopharmaceutical customers relying on outside parties to provide important inputs and services for their clinical research and\nmanufacturing remains a long-term growth driver for us, we believe that recent industry trends and uncertainties, including changes in our customers’ spending priorities and\nbudgetary policies and practices, which negatively impacted our revenue and operating results in the year ended December 31, 2023, may continue and result in slower growth\nand/or cause a further decline in our revenues during the year ending December 31, 2024. These trends and uncertainties, which we primarily attribute to lower levels of\ninvestment in the research and development funding of early-stage biotechnology companies and declines and uncertainties in the capital markets amidst ongoing negative\nmacroeconomic challenges, has and may continue to cause those companies to take action to conserve capital, resulting in a potential reduction in research and development\nspending across the markets in which we participate.\nOur businesses also continue to see headwinds from a general contraction in economic activity in Asia, particularly in China, which may negatively impact our revenue derived\nfrom those markets. See more information under Part I, Item 1. Business.\n65\nTable of Contents\nHow We Assess Our Business\nWe consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of our business. The key measures we use to determine how our business is performing\nare revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net (loss) income adjusted for interest, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity-\nbased compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA reflects further adjustments to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items, that we do\nnot consider representative of our ongoing operating performance. We also present Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP measure that we define as Adjusted\nEBITDA less capital expenditures.\nManagement uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the financial performance of our business and the effectiveness of our business strategies. We present Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow because we believe they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, and they\nfacilitate comparisons on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Further, we believe they are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results because they exclude\nitems that are not indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of the financial covenant under our credit agreement that governs our\nability to access more than $63.0 million in aggregate letters of credit and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In addition, if we borrow more than\n$63.0 million, we are required to maintain a specified net leverage ratio. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources of Liquidity—Debt Covenants” for a discussion of this\nfinancial covenant.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as\nreported under GAAP. We may in the future incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. In particular, we expect to incur meaningful\nshare-based compensation expense in the future. Other limitations include that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not reflect:\n• all expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n• changes in our working capital needs;\n• provision for income taxes, which may be a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate;\n• the costs of replacing the assets being depreciated, which will often have to be replaced in the future;\n• the non-cash component of employee compensation expense; and\n• the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be reflective, on a recurring basis, of our ongoing operations.\nIn addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different\nindustries.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nOur revenue consists primarily of product revenue and, to a much lesser extent, service revenue. We generated total consolidated revenue of $288.9 million and $883.0 million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, through the following segments: (i) Nucleic Acid Production and (ii) Biologics Safety Testing.\nNucleic Acid Production Segment\nOur Nucleic Acid Production segment focuses on the manufacturing and sale of highly modified nucleic acids products to support the needs of customers’ research, therapeutic\nand vaccine programs. This segment also provides research products for labeling and detecting proteins in cells and tissue samples.\nBiologics Safety Testing Segment\nOur Biologics Safety Testing segment focuses on manufacturing and selling biologics safety and impurity tests and assay development services that are utilized by our\ncustomers in their biologic drug manufacturing activities.\n66\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue associated with our products primarily consists of manufacturing related costs incurred in the production process, including personnel and related costs, equity-\nbased compensation expense, inventory write-downs, costs of materials, labor and overhead, packaging and delivery costs and allocated costs, including facilities, information\ntechnology, depreciation, and amortization of intangibles. Cost of revenue also includes adjustments for excess, obsolete or expired inventory, and idle capacity. Cost of revenue\nassociated with our services primarily consists of personnel and related costs, equity-based compensation expense, cost of materials and allocated costs, including facilities and\ninformation technology costs. Costs of services were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation expense for our employees in our commercial sales\nfunctions, marketing, executive, accounting and finance, legal and human resource functions as well as travel expenses, professional services fees, such as consulting, audit, tax\nand legal fees, general corporate costs and allocated costs, including facilities, information technology and amortization of intangibles.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will gradually increase in future periods, primarily due to expanding facilities footprint to support anticipated\nlong-term growth in the business, costs incurred in increasing our presence globally, and increases in marketing activities to drive awareness and adoption of our products and\nservices.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of salaries, benefits, equity-based compensation expense, outside contracted services, cost of supplies, in-process research and\ndevelopment costs from asset acquisitions and allocated facilities costs for employees engaged in research and development of products and services. We expense all research\nand development costs in the period in which they are incurred. Payment made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are recognized as\nprepaid assets until the goods are received or services are rendered.\nWe expect our research and development costs to increase to support our research and development efforts, including meeting our customers’ needs.\nChange in Estimated Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration consists of fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities associated with completed acquisitions. These\nadjustments are based on our assessment of the probability of achieving certain revenue thresholds and other probability factors.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring costs primarily consist of severance and other employee-related costs, facility and other exit costs, professional fees and other restructuring costs resulting from\nthe Cost Realignment Plan.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consist of interest costs and the related amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs on our outstanding debt. Interest expense also consists of\nchanges in the fair value of our interest rate cap agreement.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash balances and short-term investments in money market funds held at financial institutions.\nChange in Payable to Related Parties Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we determined that making a payment under the Tax Receivable Agreement for subsequent years was not probable under\nAccounting Standards Codification 450 - Contingencies as a result of a valuation allowance having been recorded against our deferred tax assets, and therefore, that it is more\nlikely than not that we will not\n67\nTable of Contents\ngenerate sufficient future taxable income to utilize related tax benefits that would result in a payment under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, we remeasured the non-\ncurrent portion of the liability due under the Tax Receivable Agreement to zero, as of December 31, 2023, and recorded a corresponding gain on Tax Receivable Agreement\nliability remeasurement.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAs a result of our ownership of LLC Units in Topco LLC, we are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income\nof Topco LLC and will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition, we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and establish\nvaluation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset may not be realized. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a\nfull valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and recorded a corresponding income tax expense.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss, net assets and comprehensive income or loss of our consolidated subsidiaries that is not allocable to the\nCompany based on our percentage of ownership of such entities. Income or loss attributed to the non-controlling interests is based on the LLC Units outstanding during the\nperiod and is presented on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023, we held approximately 52.6% of the outstanding LLC Units of Topco LLC, and\nMLSH 1 held approximately 47.4% of the outstanding LLC Units of Topco LLC.\n68\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nRevenue $ 288,945 $ 883,001 (67.3)%\nOperating expenses:\nCost of revenue (1) 148,743 168,957 (12.0)%\nSelling, general and administrative (1) 151,390 129,259 17.1 %\nResearch and development (1) 17,280 18,369 (5.9)%\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (3,286) (7,800) (57.9)%\nRestructuring (1) 6,466 — *\nTotal operating expenses 320,593 308,785 3.8 %\n(Loss) income from operations (31,648) 574,216 (105.5)%\nOther income (expense), net 649,384 (22,744) (2955.2)%\nIncome before income taxes 617,736 551,472 12.0 %\nIncome tax expense 756,111 60,809 1143.4 %\nNet (loss) income $ (138,375) $ 490,663 (128.2)%\nNet (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests (19,346) 270,458 (107.2)%\nNet (loss) income attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. $ (119,029) $ 220,205 (154.1)%\nNet (loss) income per Class A common share attributable to Maravai LifeSciences\nHoldings, Inc.:\nBasic $ (0.90) $ 1.67\nDiluted $ (0.90) $ 1.67\nWeighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding:\nBasic 131,919 131,545\nDiluted 131,919 255,323\nNon-GAAP measures:\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 65,309 $ 637,800\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow $ 12,621 $ 586,052\n____________________\n* Not meaningful\n(1) Includes equity-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 Change\nCost of revenue $ 7,324 $ 4,192 74.7 %\nSelling, general and administrative 24,650 13,349 84.7 %\nResearch and development 2,715 1,129 140.5 %\nRestructuring (101) — *\nTotal equity-based compensation expense $ 34,588 $ 18,670 85.3 %\n69\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nConsolidated revenue by segment was as follows for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, Percentage of Revenue\n2023 2022 Change 2023 2022\nNucleic Acid Production $ 224,769 $ 813,069 (72.4)% 77.8 % 92.1 %\nBiologics Safety Testing 64,176 69,932 (8.2)% 22.2 % 7.9 %\nTotal revenue $ 288,945 $ 883,001 (67.3)% 100.0 % 100.0 %\nTotal revenue was $288.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $883.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of $594.1\nmillion, or 67.3%.\nNucleic Acid Production revenue decreased from $813.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a\ndecrease of $588.3 million, or 72.4%. The decrease in Nucleic Acid Production was primarily driven by decreased revenue from our proprietary CleanCap analogs as demand\ndecreased from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we estimate that approximately $60.8 million, or 54.7%, of our $111.1 million\nCleanCap revenue was a result of customer demand attributable to COVID-19 vaccines or other COVID-19 related commercial products or developmental programs. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that approximately $599.8 million, or 90.8%, of our $660.5 million CleanCap revenue was a result of customer demand attributable\nto COVID-19 vaccines or other COVID-19 related commercial products or developmental programs.\nBiologics Safety Testing revenue decreased from $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a\ndecrease of $5.8 million, or 8.2%. The decrease was primarily due to an industry-wide weak demand environment and slowdowns in biologics manufacturing, which continued\nto impact demand for our HCP ELISA kits.\nSegment Information\nManagement has determined that adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization is the profit or loss measure used to make resource allocation decisions\nand evaluate segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA assists management in comparing the segment performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision-\nmaking by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the core operations and, therefore, are not included in measuring segment\nperformance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, certain non-cash items and other adjustments that we do\nnot consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance from period to period. Corporate costs, net of eliminations, are managed on a standalone basis and are not\nallocated to segments.\nWe do not allocate assets to our reportable segments as they are not included in the review performed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker for purposes of assessing segment\nperformance and allocating resources.\nAs of December 31, 2023, all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe following schedule includes revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each of our reportable operating segments (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue:\nNucleic Acid Production $ 224,769 $ 813,076\nBiologics Safety Testing 64,179 69,932\nTotal reportable segments’ revenue 288,948 883,008\nIntersegment eliminations (3) (7)\nTotal $ 288,945 $ 883,001\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\nNucleic Acid Production $ 82,658 $ 638,337\nBiologics Safety Testing 46,908 54,841\nTotal reportable segments’ adjusted EBITDA 129,566 693,178\nReconciliation of total reportable segments’ adjusted EBITDA to income before income taxes\nAmortization (27,356) (24,269)\nDepreciation (12,898) (7,566)\nInterest expense (45,892) (20,414)\nInterest income 27,727 2,338\nCorporate costs, net of eliminations (64,257) (55,378)\nOther adjustments:\nAcquisition contingent consideration 3,286 7,800\nAcquisition integration costs (12,695) (13,362)\nEquity-based compensation (34,588) (18,670)\nMerger and acquisition related expenses (4,392) (2,416)\nFinancing costs — (1,078)\nAcquisition related tax adjustment (1,293) (349)\nTax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment 668,886 (4,102)\nChief Executive Officer transition costs (28) (2,426)\nRestructuring costs (1) (6,567) —\nOther (1,763) (1,814)\nIncome before income taxes 617,736 551,472\nIncome tax expense (756,111) (60,809)\nNet (loss) income $ (138,375) $ 490,663\n___________________\n(1) Equity-based compensation benefit of $0.1 million related to forfeited equity awards in connection with the restructuring is included on the equity-based compensation line item.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, intersegment revenue was immaterial between the Nucleic Acid Production and Biologics Safety Testing segments. The\nintersegment sales and the related gross margin on inventory recorded at the end of the period are eliminated for consolidation purposes. Internal selling prices for intersegment\nsales are consistent with the segment’s normal retail price offered to external parties. There was no commission expense recognized for intersegment sales for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\n71\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, is set forth below (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet (loss) income $ (138,375) $ 490,663\nAdd:\nAmortization 27,356 24,269\nDepreciation 12,898 7,566\nInterest expense 45,892 20,414\nInterest income (27,727) (2,338)\nIncome tax expense 756,111 60,809\nEBITDA 676,155 601,383\nAcquisition contingent consideration (1) (3,286) (7,800)\nAcquisition integration costs (2) 12,695 13,362\nEquity-based compensation (3) 34,588 18,670\nMerger and acquisition related expenses (4) 4,392 2,416\nFinancing costs (5) — 1,078\nAcquisition related tax adjustment (6) 1,293 349\nTax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment (7) (668,886) 4,102\nChief Executive Officer transition costs (8) 28 2,426\nRestructuring costs (9) 6,567 —\nOther (10) 1,763 1,814\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 65,309 $ 637,800\n____________________\n(1) Refers to the change in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration related to completed acquisitions.\n(2) Refers to incremental costs incurred to execute and integrate completed acquisitions, and retention payments in connection with these acquisitions.\n(3) Refers to non-cash expense associated with equity-based compensation.\n(4) Refers to diligence, legal, accounting, tax and consulting fees incurred associated with acquisitions that were pursued but not consummated.\n(5) Refers to transaction costs related to the refinancing of our long-term debt that are not capitalizable.\n(6) Refers to non-cash expense associated with adjustments to the carrying value of the indemnification asset recorded in connection with the acquisition of MyChem, LLC (“MyChem”),\nwhich was completed in January 2022.\n(7) For the year ended December 31, 2023, refers to the adjustment of our Tax Receivable Agreement liability primarily due to remeasuring the non-current portion of the liability to zero as\nwe no longer consider the payments under the agreement to be probable.

We revised our capital\nexpenditures definition in the quarter ended March 31, 2023 to exclude the portions in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses include the following for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, Percentage of Revenue\n2023 2022 Change 2023 2022\nCost of revenue $ 148,743 $ 168,957 (12.0)% 51.5 % 19.1 %\nSelling, general and administrative 151,390 129,259 17.1 % 52.4 % 14.7 %\nResearch and development 17,280 18,369 (5.9)% 6.0 % 2.1 %\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (3,286) (7,800) (57.9)% (1.1)% (0.9)%\nRestructuring 6,466 — * 2.2 % — %\nTotal operating expenses $ 320,593 $ 308,785 3.8 % 111.0 % 35.0 %\n____________________\n* Not meaningful\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue decreased by $20.2 million from $169.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $148.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or 12.0%. The\ndecrease in cost of revenue compared to the prior period was primarily attributable to a decrease of $42.2 million in direct product costs driven by overall decreased revenues.\nThis was partially offset by an increase of $14.3 million in personnel costs primarily driven by retention payment accruals associated with the acquisition of MyChem,\nadditional headcount to support expanded manufacturing capacity and additional headcount related to the acquisition of Alphazyme, an increase of $6.0 million in depreciation\nand amortization expense primarily due to new equipment and newly acquired intangible assets, and an increase of $1.6 million in facilities costs driven by new facilities.\nGross profit decreased by $573.8 million from $714.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $140.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in\ngross profit margin as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in volume, unfavorable product mix shift, an overall increase in the cost of revenue as a\npercentage of sales as the result of higher labor and facility costs, and depreciation and amortization.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $22.1 million from $129.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $151.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, or 17.1%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $22.7 million in personnel costs largely due to additional headcount from the acquisition of\nAlphazyme and incremental equity-based compensation expense.\n73\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $1.1 million from $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023, or 5.9%. The decrease in expenses compared to the prior period was primarily driven by a decrease of $1.8 million in personnel costs largely due to certain retention\npayment accruals now being included in cost of revenue. This is partially offset by an increase of $0.6 million in facilities costs driven by new facilities.\nChange in Estimated Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nThe change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration changed by $4.5 million from $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $3.3 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023, or 57.9%. The changes were due to the decreases in estimated fair value of the liability for the contingent payments associated with the acquisitions\nof Alphazyme and MyChem. These were due to changes in estimates associated with revenue projections relative to defined revenue targets or thresholds that would trigger\ncontingent payments per the Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and sellers of Alphazyme and the Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and\nthe sellers of MyChem. See Notes 2 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 relate to the Cost Realignment Plan, which was implemented in November 2023. These include severance and other\nemployee-related costs of $4.3 million, offset by a $0.1 million equity-based compensation benefit, facility and other exit costs of $2.0 million, and professional fees and other\nassociated costs of $0.3 million. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) includes the following for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nYear Ended December 31, Percentage of Revenue\n2023 2022 Change 2023 2022\nInterest expense $ (45,892) $ (20,414) 124.8 % (15.9)% (2.3)%\nInterest income 27,727 2,338 1085.9 % 9.6 % 0.2 %\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — (208) * — % 0.0 %\nChange in payable to related parties pursuant to the Tax\nReceivable Agreement 668,886 (4,102) * 231.5 % (0.5)%\nOther expense (1,337) (358) 273.5 % (0.5)% 0.0 %\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 649,384 $ (22,744) * 224.7 % (2.6)%\n____________________\n* Not meaningful\nOther expense was $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to Other income of $649.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a\nchange of $672.1 million. The overall change in Other income (expense) was primarily attributable to a $668.9 million gain related to the payable to related parties pursuant to\nthe Tax Receivable Agreement as we concluded that it was not probable that we will be able to realize the remaining tax benefits based on estimates of future taxable income.\nThis was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in Other expense relating to the indemnification asset recorded in connection with the acquisition of MyChem.\nRelationship with GTCR, LLC (“GTCR”)\nAs of December 31, 2023, investment entities affiliated with GTCR collectively controlled approximately 56% of the voting power of our common stock, which enables GTCR\nto control the vote of all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders and to control the election of members of the Board and all other corporate decisions.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company made distributions of $9.6 million and $150.2 million, respectively, for tax liabilities to MLSH 1.\nWe are also a party to a Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, with MLSH 1, who is primarily owned by GTCR, and MLSH 2 (see Note 14 to our consolidated financial\nstatements). The TRA provides for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some\ncircumstances are deemed to\n74\nTable of Contents\nrealize, from exchanges of LLC Units (together with the corresponding shares of Class B common stock) for Class A common stock, as a result of (i) certain increases in the tax\nbasis of assets of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from purchases or exchanges of LLC Units, (ii) certain tax attributes of the entities acquired from MLSH 1 and\nMLSH 2 in connection with the Organizational Transactions, Topco LLC and subsidiaries of Topco LLC that existed prior to the IPO, and (iii) certain other tax benefits related\nto our entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments that we make under the TRA (collectively, the “Tax Attributes”). Payment obligations under the\nTRA are not conditioned upon any Topco LLC unitholders maintaining a continued ownership interest in us or Topco LLC, and the rights of MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 under the\nTRA are assignable. There is no stated term for the TRA, and the TRA will continue until all tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate\nthe TRA for an agreed-upon amount.\nWe recognize the amount of TRA payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months and classify this amount as current. This determination was based on our estimate of\ntaxable income for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, our current liability under the TRA was $7.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has derecognized the remaining non-current liability under the TRA after concluding it was not probable that the Company will be able\nto realize the remaining tax benefits based on estimates of future taxable income. The estimation of liability under the TRA is by its nature imprecise and subject to significant\nassumptions regarding the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income in the future. If the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets applicable to the\ntax attributes referenced above is released in a future period, the remaining TRA liability may be considered probable at that time and recorded on the consolidated balance\nsheet and within earnings.\nWe made payments of $42.6 million to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the TRA during the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $0.4 million is related to interest. This\ndetermination was based on our taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2022. We made payments of $35.3 million to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the TRA\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022, of which $1.1 million is related to interest. This determination was based on our taxable income for the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have financed our operations primarily from cash flow from operations, borrowings under long-term debt agreements and, to a lesser extent, the sale of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $575.0 million and retained earnings of $285.7 million. We had a net loss of $138.4 million for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023. We also had positive cash flow from operations of $126.2 million.\nWe have relied on revenue derived from product and services sales, and equity and debt financings to fund our operations to date.\nOur principal uses of cash have been to fund operations, acquisitions and capital expenditures, as well as make tax distributions to MLSH 1, make TRA payments to MLSH 1\nand MLSH 2 and make interest payments and mandatory principal payments on our long-term debt.\nWe plan to utilize our existing cash on hand, together with cash generated from operations, primarily to fund our commercial and marketing activities associated with our\nproducts and services, continued research and development initiatives, and ongoing investments into our manufacturing facilities to create efficiencies and build capacity. We\nbelieve our cash on hand, cash generated from operations and continued access to our credit facilities, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months\nand beyond.\nWe expect to spend approximately $2.8 million in restructuring costs primarily during the first quarter of 2024 associated with the Cost Realignment Plan using existing cash on\nhand.\nAs a result of our ownership of LLC Units in Topco LLC, the Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable\nincome of Topco LLC and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations and we may be\nrequired to make payments under the TRA with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. Due to the uncertainty of various factors, we cannot precisely quantify the likely tax benefits we will\nrealize as a result of LLC Unit exchanges and the resulting amounts we are likely to pay out to LLC Unitholders of Topco LLC pursuant to the TRA. Assuming no changes in\nthe relevant tax law, we expect that probable future payments under the TRA relating to the purchase by the Company of LLC Units from MLSH 1 and the corresponding tax\nattributes to be approximately $7.1 million. This determination is based on our estimate of taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we determined that making a payment under the non-current\n75\nTable of Contents\nportion of the TRA was not probable under Accounting Standards Codification 450 - Contingencies since a valuation allowance has been recorded against our deferred tax\nassets and we do not believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize related tax benefits and result in a payment under the TRA. If we had determined that\nmaking a payment under the TRA and generating sufficient future taxable income was probable, we would have also recorded a liability pursuant to the TRA, net of current\nportion, of approximately $665.3 million in the consolidated balance sheet. Future payments in respect of subsequent exchanges or financings and tax attributes relating to the\npurchase by the Company of LLC Units from MLSH 1 would be in addition to this amount and may be substantial. The foregoing numbers are estimates and the actual\npayments could differ materially. We expect to fund these payments using cash on hand and cash generated from operations.\nAs a result of a change of control, material breach, or our election to terminate the TRA early, (1) we could be required to make cash payments to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 that are\ngreater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the TRA, and (2) we will be required to make an\nimmediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the TRA, which payment may be made significantly in advance of\nthe actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and could have\nthe effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we\nwill be able to finance our obligations under the TRA.\nIn addition to payments to be made under the TRA, we are also required to make tax distributions to MLSH 1 pursuant to the LLC Operating Agreement for the portion of\nincome passing through to them from Topco LLC. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company made distributions of $9.6 million and $150.2 million,\nrespectively, for tax liabilities to MLSH 1 under this agreement.\nCredit Agreement\nThe Credit Agreement among Intermediate, Cygnus and TriLink, as the borrowers, Topco LLC, as holdings, the lenders from time-to-time party thereto and Morgan Stanley\nSenior Funding, Inc., as administrative and collateral agent (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the “Credit Agreement”), provides us with a term-loan facility\n(the “Term Loan”) totaling $600.0 million and a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) of $180.0 million for letters of credit and loans to be used for\nworking capital and other general corporate financing purposes. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Topco LLC, along with the existing\nand future material domestic subsidiaries of Topco LLC (subject to certain exceptions) as specified in the respective guaranty agreements, and are secured by a lien and security\ninterest in substantially all of the assets of existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of Topco LLC that are loan parties.\nIn January 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to refinance the term loan and to replace London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) with a\nTerm Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based rate.\nCommencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Credit Agreement requires that we make mandatory prepayments on the Term\nLoan principal out of certain excess cash flow, subject to certain step-downs based on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio. The mandatory prepayment shall be reduced to\n25% or 0% of the calculated excess cash flow if the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio was equal to or less than 4.75:1.00 or 4.25:1.00, respectively; however, no\nprepayment is required to the extent excess cash flow calculated for the respective period is equal to or less than $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, our first lien net\nleverage ratio was less than 4.25:1.00. Thus, a mandatory prepayment on the Term Loan out of excess cash flow was not required.\nThe Term Loan became repayable in quarterly payments of $1.4 million beginning in March 2022, with all remaining outstanding principal due in October 2027. The Term\nLoan includes prepayment provisions that allow us, at our option, to repay all or a portion of the principal amount at any time. The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to repay\nand borrow from time to time until October 2025, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, we are required to repay\nborrowings under the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility with the proceeds of certain occurrences, such as the incurrence of debt, certain equity contributions and certain\nasset sales or dispositions.\nAccrued interest under the Credit Agreement is payable by us (a) quarterly in arrears with respect to Base Rate loans, (b) at the end of each interest rate period (or at each three-\nmonth interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months) with respect to Term SOFR Rate loans, (c) on the date of any repayment or prepayment and\n(d) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). An annual commitment fee is applied to the daily unutilized amount under the Revolving Credit Facility at 0.375% per\nannum, with one stepdown to 0.25% per annum based on Intermediate’s first lien net leverage ratio.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Credit Agreement includes financial covenants. One financial covenant is a consolidated first lien coverage ratio measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. Another\nrequires that, if as of the end of any fiscal quarter the aggregate amount of\n76\nTable of Contents\nletters of credit obligations and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility outstanding as of the end of such fiscal quarter (excluding cash collateralized letters of credit\nobligations and letter of credit obligations in an aggregate amount not in excess of $5.0 million at any time outstanding and for the first four fiscal quarters ending after October\n2020, borrowings of revolving credit loans made before October 2020) exceeds 35% of the aggregate amount of all Revolving Credit Commitments in effect as of such date,\nthen the net leverage ratio of Intermediate may not be greater than 8.00 to 1.00. For purposes of this covenant, the net leverage ratio is calculated by dividing outstanding first\nlien indebtedness (net of cash) by Adjusted EBITDA over the preceding four fiscal quarters.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains negative and affirmative covenants in addition to the financial covenant, including covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things,\nincur or prepay certain indebtedness, pay dividends or distributions, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments, and make\nchanges in the nature of the business. The Credit Agreement contains certain events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment of principal, interest or other\nobligations, violation of the covenants, insolvency, court ordered judgments and certain changes of control. The Credit Agreement also requires the Company to provide audited\nconsolidated financial statements to the lenders no later than 120 days after year-end.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2023, interest rate on the Term Loan was 8.40%.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe are a party to the TRA with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. The TRA provides for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, of 85% of the amount of certain tax\nbenefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of the Organizational Transactions, IPO and any subsequent purchases or\nexchanges of LLC Units of Topco LLC.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our current liability under the TRA was $7.1 million, representing 85% of the calculated tax savings we expect to utilize for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a gain of $668.9 million, in connection with a TRA liability adjustment due to remeasuring the\nnon-current portion of the liability to zero as we no longer consider the payments under the agreement to be probable. We may record additional liabilities under the TRA when\nLLC Units are exchanged in the future and as our estimates of the future utilization of the Tax Attributes, net operating losses and other tax benefits change. We expect to make\npayments under the TRA, to the extent they are required, within 125 days after the extended due date of our U.S. federal income tax return for such taxable year. Interest on\nsuch payments will begin to accrue from the due date (without extensions) of such tax return at a rate of LIBOR (or, if LIBOR ceases to be published, a Replacement Rate) plus\n100 basis points. Generally, any late payments will continue to accrue interest at LIBOR (or a Replacement Rate, as applicable) plus 500 basis points until such payments are\nmade. Given the cessation of LIBOR, we have transitioned to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the applicable Replacement Rate as allowable under the Tax\nReceivable Agreement.\nThe payment obligations under the TRA are obligations of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. and not of Topco LLC. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments\nthat may be made under the TRA will vary, the aggregate payments that we will be required to make to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 may be substantial. Any payments made by us\nunder the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to Topco LLC and, to the extent that we are unable to\nmake payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. We anticipate funding ordinary course payments\nunder the TRA from cash flow from operations of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries, available cash and/or available borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we determined that making a payment under the non-current portion of the TRA was not probable underA ccounting Standards\nCodification 450 - Contingencies as a result of a valuation allowance having been recorded against our deferred tax assets, and therefore, that it is more likely than not that we\nwill not generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize related tax benefits that would result in a payment under the TRA. If we had determined that making a payment\nunder the TRA and generating sufficient future taxable income was probable, we would have also recorded a liability pursuant to the TRA, net of current portion, of\napproximately $665.3 million in the consolidated balance sheet.\n77\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 126,224 $ 535,977\nInvesting activities (122,310) (267,612)\nFinancing activities (61,090) (187,499)\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (57,176) $ 80,866\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $126.2 million, which was primarily attributable to a net cash inflow from the change in our\noperating assets and liabilities of $97.8 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization of $40.3 million, non-cash amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of $8.5\nmillion, non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs of $2.9 million, non-cash equity-based compensation of $34.6 million, and non-cash deferred income taxes of $754.9\nmillion. These were partially offset by a net loss of $138.4 million, non-cash gain on the change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration of $3.3 million, and non-cash\ngain on the revaluation of liabilities under the TRA of $668.9 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $536.0 million, which was primarily attributable to a net income of $490.7 million, non-\ncash depreciation and amortization of $31.8 million, non-cash amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets of $6.3 million, non-cash amortization of deferred financing\ncosts of $2.8 million, non-cash equity-based compensation of $18.7 million, non-cash deferred income taxes of $42.3 million, and non-cash loss on the revaluation of liabilities\nunder the TRA of $4.1 million. These were partially offset by a non-cash loss on the change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration $7.8 million, and a net cash\noutflow from the change in our operating assets and liabilities of $45.1 million, which is net of government funding of $17.0 million. The net cash outflow from the change in\nour operating assets includes $13.4 million relating to an increase in prepaid lease payments for Flanders I (as defined in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $122.3 million, which was primarily comprised of $69.8 million for the net cash consideration\npaid for the acquisition of Alphazyme and cash outflows of $65.6 million for property and equipment purchases. These were partially offset by proceeds from government\nassistance allocated to property and equipment of $12.9 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $267.6 million, which was primarily comprised of $239.0 million for the net cash consideration\npaid for the acquisition of MyChem, net cash outflows of $17.1 million for property and equipment purchases, and $13.3 million of prepaid lease payments for Flanders II (as\ndefined in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $61.1 million, which was primarily attributable to $42.2 million of payments to MLSH 1 and\nMLSH 2 pursuant to the TRA, a $9.7 million payment of acquisition consideration holdback relating to the acquisition of MyChem, $9.6 million of distributions for tax\nliabilities to non-controlling interest holders, required pursuant to the terms of the LLC Operating Agreement, and $5.4 million of principal repayments of long-term debt. This\nwas partially offset by proceeds from derivative instruments of $6.2 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $187.5 million, which was primarily attributable to $150.2 million of distributions for tax\nliabilities to non-controlling interest holders, required pursuant to the terms of the LLC Operating Agreement, $34.2 million of payments to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to\nthe TRA, and $13.9 million of principal repayments of long-term debt. This was partially offset by proceeds from borrowings of long-term debt of $8.5 million.\n78\nTable of Contents\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $52.7 million, which is net of government funding of $12.9 million. Capital expenditures for the year ending\nDecember 31, 2024 are projected to be in the range of $30.0 million to $35.0 million, which is net of anticipated government funding recognized. This includes leasehold\nimprovements and equipment primarily for the Flanders San Diego Facility.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nPayments due by period\nTotal 1 year 2 - 3 years 4 - 5 years 5+ years\nOperating leases (1) $ 65,533 $ 10,224 $ 20,431 $ 17,228 $ 17,650\nFinance leases (2) 34,517 3,327 6,957 7,380 16,853\nDebt obligations (3) 533,120 5,440 10,880 516,800 —\nTRA payments (4) 7,069 7,069 — — —\nUnconditional purchase obligations (5) 3,300 3,300 — — —\nMyChem retention payments (6) 20,000 20,000 — — —\nTotal $ 663,539 $ 49,360 $ 38,268 $ 541,408 $ 34,503\n_______________\n(1) Represents operating lease payment obligations, excluding any renewal options we are reasonably certain to execute and have recognized as lease liabilities.

See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(6) Represents certain payments to the sellers of MyChem as of the second anniversary of the closing of the acquisition date as long as they continue to be employed by TriLink. See Note 2 to\nour consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nTax distributions are required under the terms of the Topco LLC Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, we have made tax distributions equal to the estimated obligation due for\n2023. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding tax distributions.\nCommencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Credit Agreement requires that we make mandatory prepayments of the Term\nLoan principal upon certain excess cash flow, subject to certain step-downs based on our first lien net leverage ratio. The mandatory prepayment shall be reduced to 25% or 0%\nof the calculated excess cash flow if the first lien net leverage ratio was equal to or less than 4.75:1.00 or 4.25:1.00, respectively; however, no prepayment shall be required to\nthe extent excess cash flow calculated for the respective period is equal to or less than $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, our first lien net leverage ratio was less than\n4.25:1.00.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Alphazyme, we may be required to make additional payments of up to $75.0 million to the sellers of Alphazyme dependent upon meeting\nor exceeding defined revenue targets during fiscal years 2023 through 2025. We may also be required to make certain payments of $9.3 million to its sellers and certain\nemployees as of various dates but primarily through December 31, 2025 as long as these individuals continue to be employed by the Company. We cannot, at this time,\ndetermine when or if the related targets will be achieved or whether the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur. Therefore, such payments were\nnot included in the table above. See Notes 2 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our estimates are based on\nhistorical\n79\nTable of Contents\nexperience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions\nand any such difference may be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following discussion addresses our most\ncritical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which require subjective and complex judgments.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. We are the controlling member of Topco LLC, which has been, and will continue to be, treated as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal and state income tax purposes. Topco LLC’s previously wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, Maravai Life Sciences, Inc. (“Maravai Inc.”) and its subsidiaries, were\ntaxpaying entities in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Maravai Inc.’s subsidiaries were sold and Maravai Inc. ceased to be a regarded entity and was deemed liquidated for U.S.\ntax purposes during the year ended December 31, 2021. Topco LLC’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Maravai LifeSciences International Holdings, Inc., is a taxpaying entity for\nU.S. and foreign jurisdictions and had limited activity subject to a transfer pricing arrangement during the year ended December 31, 2023. Topco LLC’s other subsidiaries are\ntreated as pass-through entities for federal and state income tax purposes. The income or loss generated by these entities is not taxed at the LLC level. As required by U.S. tax\nlaw, income or loss generated by these LLCs passes through to their owners. As such, our tax provision consists solely of the activities of Maravai Inc. and its subsidiaries, prior\nto their disposal, and Maravai LifeSciences International Holdings, Inc., as well as our share of income or loss generated by Topco LLC. We anticipate this structure to remain\nin existence for the foreseeable future.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to\ndifferences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle\nthose temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the\nenactment date. We reduce the measurement of a deferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the\ndeferred tax asset.\nThe realizability of the Company’s deferred tax asset related to its investment in Topco LLC depends on the Company receiving allocations of tax deductions for its tax basis in\nthe investment and on the Company generating sufficient taxable income to fully offset such deductions. We believe it is more likely than not that the Company will not\ngenerate sufficient taxable income in the future to fully realize any deductions allocated to it from Topco LLC associated with the reversal of its tax basis as of December 31,\n2023. In addition, a portion of the deferred tax asset may only be realizable through the sale or liquidation of the investment and our ability to generate sufficient capital gains.\nAs such, a valuation allowance of $642.2 million has been recorded as of December 31, 2023 to reflect the deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to not be realized.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the\nposition will be sustained upon examination.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the accounting for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, many transactions and calculations arise where the ultimate\ntax outcome is uncertain. Our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to the accounting for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current\ntax laws, and possible outcomes of future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome\nof matters could be different from our assumptions and estimates used when determining the accounting for income taxes. Such differences, if identified in future periods, could\nhave a material effect on the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nPayable to Related Parties Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nIn November 2020, we entered into a TRA with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. The TRA provides for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, of 85% of the amount\nof tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize from exchanges of LLC Units (together with the corresponding share of Class B\nCommon stock), as a result of (i) certain increases in the tax basis of assets of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from purchases or exchanges of LLC Units, (ii) increase\nin the tax basis of assets of Topco LLC received form LLC Units held by entities acquired from MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 in connection with the Organizational Transactions,\nTopco LLC and subsidiaries of Topco LLC that existed prior to this offering and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the TRA, including tax benefits\nattributable to payments that we make under the TRA (collectively, the “Tax Attributes”). The payment obligations under the TRA are not\n80\nTable of Contents\nconditioned upon any LLC Unitholder maintaining a continued ownership interest in us or Topco LLC and the rights of MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 under the TRA are assignable.\nWe expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of the tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize.\nWe accrue a liability for the payable to related parties for the TRA and a reduction to stockholders’ equity, when it is deemed probable that the Tax Attributes will be used to\nreduce our taxable income, as the contractual percentage of the benefit of Tax Attributes that we expected to receive over a period of time. The current portion, if any, of the\nliability is the amount estimated to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date. For purposes of estimating the value of the payable to related parties for the TRA, the tax\nbenefit deemed realized by us and payable to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 is computed by taking 85% of the difference between undiscounted forecasted cash income tax liability\nover the term of benefit of the Tax Attributes and the forecasted amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no Tax Attributes (i.e. a with-and-\nwithout analysis); provided that, for purposes of determining the tax benefit with respect to state and local income taxes, use simplifying assumptions. The TRA will generally\napply to each of our taxable years, beginning with the taxable year that the TRA is entered into. There is no maximum term for the TRA and the TRA will continue until all such\ntax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the TRA for an agreed-upon amount equal to the estimated present value of the remaining\npayments to be made under the agreement (calculated with certain assumptions, including as to utilization of the Tax Attributes). We may record additional liabilities under the\nTRA when LLC Units of Topco LLC are exchanged in the future and as our estimates of the future utilization of the tax benefits change. If, due to a change in facts, these tax\nattributes are not utilized in future years, it is reasonably possible no amounts would be paid under the TRA. In this scenario, the reduction of the liability under the TRA would\nresult in a benefit to our consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent adjustments to the payable to related parties for the TRA based on changes in anticipated future\ntaxable income, which could include changes in estimated income allocated to the partners of Topco LLC or apportionment of state income taxes, are recorded in our\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nThe actual Tax Attributes, as well as any amounts paid to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 under the TRA, will vary depending on a number of factors, including:\n• the timing of any future exchanges—for instance, the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair value, which may fluctuate over time, of the\ndepreciable or amortizable assets of Topco LLC and its flow-through subsidiaries at the time of each exchange;\n• the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of any future exchanges—the increases and adjustments in our proportionate share of the existing tax basis\nof the assets of Topco LLC and its flow-through subsidiaries that are directly related to the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of future exchanges;\n• the extent to which such exchanges are taxable—if an exchange is not taxable for any reason, increased tax deductions as a result of legacy IRC Section 754 election in\nplace at Topco LLC will not be available to generate payments under the TRA;\n• the amount and timing of our income—the TRA generally will require us to pay 85% of the tax benefits as and when those benefits are treated as realized by us under the\nterms of the TRA. If we do not have taxable income in a particular taxable year, we generally will not be required (absent a change of control or other circumstances\nrequiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the TRA for that taxable year because no tax benefits will have been actually realized. Nevertheless,\nany tax benefits that do not result in realized tax benefits in a given taxable year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate tax benefits in future\n(and possibly previous) taxable years. The utilization of any such tax attributes will result in payments under the TRA; and\n• applicable tax rates—the tax rates in effect at the time a tax benefit is recognized.\nThe payment obligations under the TRA are obligations of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. and not of Topco LLC. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments\nthat may be made under the TRA will vary, we expect that the aggregate payments that we will be required to make to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 may be substantial. Any payments\nmade by us under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or to Topco LLC and, to the extent that we are\nunable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. We anticipate funding ordinary course\npayments under the TRA from cash flow from operations of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries, available cash and/or available borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nAssuming no changes in the relevant tax law, we expect that probable future payments under the TRA relating to the purchase by the Company of LLC Units from MLSH 1 and\nthe tax attributes to be approximately $7.1 million. This determination is based on our estimate of taxable income for the year ended December 31, 2023. To the extent there is\na change in the determination of the realizability of our deferred tax assets, this could impact the expected probable future payments under the TRA and the amount recorded in\nthe consolidated balance sheet. Future payments in respect of subsequent exchanges or\n81\nTable of Contents\nfinancings and tax attributes relating to the purchase by the Company of LLC Units from MLSH 1 would be in addition to this amount and may be substantial. The foregoing\nnumbers are estimates and the actual payments could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized\nand the corresponding TRA payments. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, the payments under the TRA\nexceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the TRA and/or distributions to us by Topco LLC are not sufficient to permit us to make payments\nunder the TRA after we have paid taxes.\nThe term of the TRA commenced upon the completion of our IPO and will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expire, unless we exercise our rights to\nterminate the agreements or payments under the agreements are accelerated in the event we materially breach any of our material obligations under the agreements.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying value. Such indicators could include, but are not limited to, current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market\ncapitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel. We perform our annual impairment test\nin the fourth quarter.\nWe first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If\nmanagement concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, management performs a quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test. In performing the quantitative impairment test, management considers a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, including an\nindependent valuation to conduct this test. The valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of a reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and\nratio comparisons of similar companies. We base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, or market participants. If the carrying value of a reporting\nunit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\nDue to the sustained decline in our stock price and the announcement of the Cost Realignment Plan in November 2023, we performed a quantitative analysis and compared our\nreporting units’ fair values to their respective carrying values to determine whether goodwill was impaired. We determined the fair values of our reporting units using a\ncombination of the income approach using discounted cash flows and the market approach utilizing data from comparable public companies. The assumptions and estimates,\nincluding management’s estimated future revenue growth rates, estimated future margins and discount rates, used in the quantitative analysis were based on management’s best\nestimate about current and future conditions. The result of the quantitative analysis showed that the reporting units’ fair values exceeded their carrying values and there was no\nimpairment of the recorded goodwill as of December 31, 2023. However, to the extent we continue to experience declines in our stock price or experience other impairment\nindicators, such as industry and market considerations or a decline in financial performance, or that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values, there\ncould be a risk of goodwill impairment of our reporting units in future periods.\nRecoverability and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the recoverability of our long-lived assets (including definite-lived intangible assets) if events or circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired. We measure\nrecoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying value of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, to be generated from\nsuch assets. If our analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable, we measure an impairment based on the amount by which the net carrying amount\nof the assets exceeds the fair values of the assets.\nIn conjunction with the goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2023, we also performed a recoverability assessment of our long-lived assets. The\nresults of the analysis did not result in an impairment charge.\nRecognition of Intangible Assets as Part of a Business Combination\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of acquired businesses be\nrecorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price, which includes the fair value of consideration transferred, is attributed to the fair value of\nthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price of the acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as\ngoodwill.\nDetermining the fair value of intangible assets acquired requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies,\nassumptions about future net cash flows, discount rates and market\n82\nTable of Contents\nparticipants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value attributed to the identifiable intangible asset acquired in a business combination.\nWe generally utilize a discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\nFor the acquisitions of Alphazyme, LLC and MyChem, LLC, the estimated fair values of the developed technology intangible assets were based on the multi-period excess\nearnings method. The estimated fair values were developed by discounting future net cash flows to their present value at market-based rates of return. We selected the\nassumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated revenue growth rates, management’s\nplans, and guideline companies. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair value of these intangible assets included revenue growth rates, discount\nrates and assumed technical obsolescent curves.\nThe use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value and amounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets acquired and future\namortization expense as well as goodwill.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2023, our primary exposure to interest rate risk was associated with our variable rate long-term debt. Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest\nat a rate equal to the Base Rate plus a margin of 2.00%, with respect to each Base Rate-based loan, or the Term SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin of\n3.00% with respect to each Term SOFR-based loan, subject in each case to an applicable Base Rate or Term SOFR floor (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements).\nInterest rates can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including changes in the fiscal and monetary policies or geopolitical events or changes in general economic conditions. This\ncould adversely affect our cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have an interest rate cap agreement in place to hedge a portion of our variable interest rate risk on our outstanding long-term debt. The agreement\nhas a contract notional amount of $500.0 million and entitles us to receive from the counterparty at each calendar quarter end the amount, if any, by which a specified floating\nmarket rate exceeds the cap strike interest rate. The floating interest rate is reset at the end of each three-month period. The contract expires on January 19, 2025.\nWe had $533.1 million of outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan and no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would have changed our interest expense by\napproximately $5.4 million.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $575.0 million as of December 31, 2023. Given the short-term nature of our investments, we do not believe there is any material risk to the\nvalue of our investments with increases or decreases in interest rates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nAll of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Although approximately 51.2% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was derived from international sales,\nprimarily in Europe and Asia Pacific, all of these sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. The majority of our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which they\nare incurred, which is primarily in the United States. As we expand our presence in international markets, to the extent we are required to enter into agreements denominated in\na currency other than the U.S. dollar, results of operations and cash flows may increasingly be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may\nbe adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign\ncurrency risk. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.\n83\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,\nand we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded goodwill of $326.0 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of potential\nimpairment exist. Under the goodwill impairment assessment, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an\nimpairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the amount of the excess carrying amount of the reporting unit over its fair\nvalue. During the current year the Company executed a quantitative assessment over the goodwill balance assigned to each reporting\nunit.\nAuditing the Company’s recoverability test for goodwill impairment assessment was challenging due to subjective estimates and\nassumptions used by the Company to determine fair value of the reporting units. The estimates were subject to higher uncertainty due\nto management judgements over significant assumptions, including revenue growth rates and valuation related discount rates.\n85\nTable of Contents\nHow We Addressed the Matter in We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill\nOur Audit impairment process, including controls over management’s review of its projected financial information utilized in the valuation of\nits reporting units.\nOur audit procedures over the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment included, among others, assessing the reasonableness of\nsignificant assumptions, specifically revenue growth rates, discount rates and assessing the completeness and accuracy of the\nunderlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We evaluated whether significant assumptions were reasonable by comparing\nthem to industry data and current market forecasts, and whether such assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other\nareas of the audit. We performed various sensitivity analyses around the assumptions to understand the impact on the fair value\ncalculation. We also involved our valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the reasonableness of the Company’s valuation\nmethodologies and certain significant assumptions used by the Company.\nPayable to related parties pursuant to a Tax Receivable Agreement\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 14 of the December 31, 2023 consolidated financial statements, the Company has a Tax Receivable\nAgreement (TRA) with certain related party investors (TRA investors). The TRA liability represents a contractual commitment to\ndistribute 85% of any tax benefits, realized or deemed to be realized by the Company to the TRA investors. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company has recorded a TRA liability of $7.1 million after concluding it was probable that, based on estimates of future\ntaxable income, the Company will owe a payment to the TRA investors. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has not recognized\nthe remaining $665.3 million liability under the TRA after concluding it was not probable that the Company will be able to realize\nbenefits based on estimates of future taxable income.\nAuditing management’s accounting for the TRA liability is complex because of the application of the tax laws used to determine the\ntax basis upon which to calculate the corresponding TRA liability and assumptions around the timing and amount of taxable income\nin the future which impacts the recognition of the TRA liability. These factors involved subjective auditor judgment and audit effort\nin performing procedures and evaluating the appropriateness of the calculation of the tax basis. In addition, the audit effort involved\nthe use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit\nevidence obtained from these procedures.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the computation and\nOur Audit recognition of the Company’s TRA liability, including testing management's controls over the completeness and accuracy of the\nunderlying data used in the valuation and recognition, and controls over management's review of the assumptions discussed above.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, testing the information used in the calculation and recognition of the TRA liability\nincluding projections of future taxable income and the involvement of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in\ndeveloping an independent calculation of the tax basis, comparing the independent calculation to management’s calculations to\nevaluate the reasonableness of the tax basis, assessing management’s application of the tax laws, and verifying the calculation of the\nTRA liability was in accordance with the terms set out in the TRA.\nRevenue with distributors\nDescription of the Matter During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s revenues were $288.9 million, of which a portion relates to products sold\nto distributors. Its distributor customers resell the products to end users. Revenues from product sales are recognized when control is\ntransferred to the Company’s customer.\n86\nTable of Contents\nAuditing the Company’s product sales to distributors was challenging, specifically related to the effort required to audit the respective\nsales activity to assess whether incentives were provided that were not properly recognized. This involved judgmentally assessing\nfactors including distributor customer ordering patterns, contractual terms, incentives offered and after shipment credits or free goods\nas described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s\nOur Audit process to monitor appropriate terms and conditions for these transactions. This includes testing relevant controls over the information\nsystems that are important to the initiation, recording and billing of revenue transactions as well as controls over the completeness and\naccuracy of the data used.\nOur audit procedures over the Company’s product sales to distributor customers included, among others, performing analytical\nprocedures to detect and investigate anomalies within the data. We also examined the terms and conditions of selected new or\namended contracts with distributor customers and its impact on the Company’s recognition model. We also confirmed the terms and\nconditions of contracts directly with a selection of distributor customers, including whether there are side agreements and terms not\nformally included in the contract that may impact the Company’s revenue recognition. In addition, we obtained written\nrepresentations from members of the commercial organization regarding the completeness of the terms and conditions reported to the\nlegal and accounting departments.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 29, 2024\n87\nTable of Contents\nMARAVAI LIFESCIENCES HOLDINGS,

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nMaravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”, and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Maravai”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) provides critical products to enable the\ndevelopment of drugs, therapeutics, diagnostics, vaccines and support research on human diseases. Our products address the key phases of biopharmaceutical development and\ninclude complex nucleic acids for diagnostic and therapeutic applications and antibody-based products to detect impurities during the production of biopharmaceutical products.\nThe Company is headquartered in San Diego, California and has historically operated in three principal businesses: Nucleic Acid Production, Biologics Safety Testing and\nProtein Detection. In September 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of its Protein Detection business (see Note 2). Our Nucleic Acid Production business\nmanufactures and sells products used in the fields of gene therapy, vaccines, nucleoside chemistry, oligonucleotide therapy and molecular diagnostics, including reagents used in\nthe chemical synthesis, modification, labelling and purification of deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) and ribonucleic acid (“RNA”). Our core Nucleic Acid Production offerings\ninclude messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”), long and short oligonucleotides, our proprietary CleanCap® capping technology and oligonucleotide building blocks, and\ncustom enzyme development and manufacturing. Our Biologics Safety Testing business sells highly specialized analytical products for use in biologic manufacturing process\ndevelopment, including custom product-specific development antibody and assay development services. Our Protein Detection business sold innovative labeling and detection\nreagents for researchers in immunohistochemistry.\nOrganization\nWe were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in August 2020 for the purpose of facilitating an initial public offering (“IPO”). Immediately prior to the IPO, we effected a\nseries of organizational transactions (the “Organizational Transactions”), which, together with the IPO, were completed in November 2020, that resulted in the Company\noperating, controlling all of the business affairs and becoming the ultimate parent company of Maravai Topco Holdings, LLC (“Topco LLC”) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nMaravai Life Sciences Holdings, LLC (“MLSH 1”), which is controlled by investment entities affiliated with GTCR, is the only other member of Topco LLC.\nThe Company is the sole managing member of Topco LLC, which operates and controls TriLink Biotechnologies, LLC (“TriLink”), Glen Research, LLC, MockV Solutions,\nLLC, Cygnus Technologies, LLC and Alphazyme, LLC (“Alphazyme”) and their respective subsidiaries. Prior to the Company’s divestiture of its Protein Detection business in\nSeptember 2021, Topco LLC also operated and controlled Vector Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Vector”).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Topco LLC, and, through Topco LLC and its subsidiaries, conducts its business. Because we manage and\noperate the business and control the strategic decisions and day-to-day operations of Topco LLC and also have a substantial financial interest in Topco LLC, we consolidate the\nfinancial results of Topco LLC, and a portion of our net (loss) income is allocated to the non-controlling interests in Topco LLC held by MLSH 1.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S.\nGAAP\") pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and include our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries.\nAll intercompany transactions and accounts between the businesses comprising the Company have been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company consolidates all entities that it controls through a majority voting interest or as the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). In determining\nwhether the Company is the primary beneficiary of an entity, the Company applies a qualitative approach that determines whether it has both (i) the power to direct the\neconomically significant activities of the entity and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to\nthat entity. The Company’s determination about whether it should consolidate such VIEs is made continuously as changes to existing relationships or future transactions may\nresult in a consolidation event.\n95\nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. These estimates form the basis for judgments the Company makes about the carrying values\nof assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are based on management’s knowledge about current events and expectations\nabout actions the Company may undertake in the future. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and\nrelated incremental borrowing rate, the payable to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined in Note 14), the realizability of our net deferred tax\nassets, and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue primarily from the sale of products, and to a much lesser extent, services in the fields of nucleic acid production and biologics safety testing.\nPrior to September 2021, the Company also generated revenue from its Protein Detection business. Products are sold primarily through a direct sales force and through\ndistributors in certain international markets where the Company does not have a direct commercial presence.\nRevenue is recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer or distributor in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity\nexpects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Distributors are the principal in all sales transactions with its customers. To determine revenue recognition for its\narrangements with customers, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the\ncontract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity\nsatisfies a performance obligation.\nThe majority of the Company’s contracts include only one performance obligation. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to\nthe customer and is defined as the unit of account for revenue recognition. The Company also recognizes revenue from other contracts that may include a combination of\nproducts and services, the provision of solely services, or from license fee arrangements which may be associated with the delivery of product. Where there is a combination of\nproducts and services, the Company accounts for the promises as individual performance obligations if they are concluded to be distinct. Performance obligations are\nconsidered distinct if they are both capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. In determining whether performance obligations meet the criteria for\nbeing distinct, the Company considers a number of factors, such as the degree of interrelation and interdependence between obligations, and whether or not the good or service\nsignificantly modifies or transforms another good or service in the contract. As a practical expedient, we do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a significant\nfinancing component if, at contract inception, the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is expected to be one year or less. Contracts with\ncustomers are evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis as contracts may include multiple types of goods and services as described below.\nRevenue from sales to customers through distributors are recognized consistent with the policies and practices for direct sales to customers, as described above.\nNucleic Acid Production\nNucleic Acid Production revenue is generated from the manufacture and sale of highly modified, complex nucleic acids products to support the needs of our of\ncustomers’ research, therapeutic and vaccine programs. The primary offering of products includes CleanCap, mRNA, specialized oligonucleotides, and enzymes.\nContracts typically consist of a single performance obligation. We also sell nucleic acid products for labeling and detecting proteins in cells and tissue samples research.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from these products in the period in which the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control to the customer or distributor.\nRevenue for nucleic acid catalog products is recognized at a single point in time, generally upon shipment to the customer or distributor. Revenue for contracts for\ncertain custom nucleic acid products, with an enforceable right to payment and a reasonable margin for work performed to date, is recognized over time, based on a cost-\nto-cost input method over the manufacturing period. Payments received from customers in advance of manufacturing their products is recorded as deferred revenue until\nthe products were delivered.\nBiologics Safety Testing\nThe Company’s Biologics Safety Testing revenue is associated with the sale of host cell protein, bioprocess impurity detection, viral clearance prediction kits and\nassociated products. We also enter into contracts that include custom\n96\nTable of Contents\nantibody development, assay development, antibody affinity extraction and mass spectrometry services. These products and services enable the detection of impurities\nthat occur in the manufacturing of biologic drugs and other therapeutics including cell and gene therapies. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of kits and\nproducts in the period in which the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control to the customer. Custom antibody development contracts consist of a single\nperformance obligation, typically with an enforceable right to payment and a reasonable margin for work performed to date. Revenue is recognized over time based on a\ncost-to-cost input method over the contract term. Where an enforceable right to payment does not exist, revenue is recognized at a point in time when control is\ntransferred to the customer. Assay development service contracts consist of a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized at a point in time when a successful\nantigen test and report is provided to the customer. Affinity extraction, mass spectrometry and other analytical services, which generally occur over a short period of\ntime, consist of a single performance obligation to perform the service and provide a summary report to the customer. Revenue is recognized upon delivery of the report\nto the customer.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length of one year or less. The Company had\nno material unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length greater than one year for any period presented.\nThe Company accepts returns only if the products do not meet customer specifications and historically, the Company’s volume of product returns has not been significant.\nFurther, no warranties are provided for promised goods and services other than assurance type warranties.\nRevenue for an individual contract is recognized at the related transaction price, which is the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the\nproducts and/or services. The transaction price for product sales is calculated at the contracted product selling price. The transaction price for a contract with multiple\nperformance obligations is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices for products are determined\nbased on the prices charged to customers, which are directly observable. Standalone selling price of services are mostly based on time and materials. Generally, payments from\ncustomers are due when goods and services are transferred. As most contracts contain a single performance obligation, the transaction price is representative of the standalone\nselling price charged to customers. Revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative amount recognized will not occur in\nfuture periods. Variable consideration has not been material to our consolidated financial statements.\nSales taxes\nSales taxes collected by the Company are not included in the transaction price as revenue as they are ultimately remitted to a governmental authority.\nShipping and handling costs\nThe Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products.\nAccordingly, revenue for shipping and handling is recognized at the same time that the related product revenue is recognized.\nContract costs\nThe Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred when the amortization period of the assets that otherwise would have been\nrecognized is one year or less. These costs are included in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. The costs to fulfill the contracts are determined to be\nimmaterial and are recognized as an expense when incurred.\nContract balances\nContract assets are generated when contractual billing schedules differ from revenue recognition timing and the Company records contract receivable when it has an\nunconditional right to consideration. There were no contract asset balances as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nContract liabilities include billings in excess of revenue recognized, such as customer deposits and deferred revenue. Customer deposits, which are included in accrued\nexpenses, are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance. Deferred revenue is recorded when the Company has unsatisfied performance\nobligations. Total contract liabilities were $5.5 million and $4.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Contract liabilities are expected to be recognized into\nrevenue within the next twelve months.\n97\nTable of Contents\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following tables summarize the revenue by segment and region for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nNucleic Acid Production Biologics Safety Testing Total\nNorth America $ 114,459 $ 26,596 $ 141,055\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa 34,390 15,532 49,922\nAsia Pacific 75,716 21,725 97,441\nLatin and Central America 204 323 527\nTotal revenue $ 224,769 $ 64,176 $ 288,945\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nNucleic Acid Production Biologics Safety Testing Total\nNorth America $ 312,119 $ 27,354 $ 339,473\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa 415,298 17,628 432,926\nAsia Pacific 85,508 24,286 109,794\nLatin and Central America 144 664 808\nTotal revenue $ 813,069 $ 69,932 $ 883,001\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nNucleic Acid Production Biologics Safety Testing Protein Detection Total\nNorth America $ 280,369 $ 25,686 $ 11,016 $ 317,071\nEurope, the Middle East and Africa 377,325 15,597 4,752 397,674\nAsia Pacific 54,114 26,471 3,068 83,653\nLatin and Central America 56 663 123 842\nTotal revenue $ 711,864 $ 68,417 $ 18,959 $ 799,240\nTotal revenue is attributed to geographic regions based on the bill-to location of the transaction. For all periods presented, the majority of our revenue was recognized at a point\nin time.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs, which are charged to customers, are included in revenue. Shipping and handling charges included in revenue were approximately$ 3.5 million, $3.2\nmillion and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Freight and supplies costs directly associated with shipping products to\ncustomers are included as a component of cost of revenue.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses include personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and equity-based compensation for laboratory personnel, outside contracted\nservices, and costs of supplies. R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in R&D are recognized as prepaid assets\nuntil the goods are received or services are rendered.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs incurred were approximately $2.9 million, $2.5 million and $1.3 million during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs relate to a cost realignment plan implemented by the Company in November 2023 to optimize business operations and match them to current market\nconditions. Restructuring costs are comprised of severance and other employee-related costs, facility and other exit costs, professional fees and other restructuring costs.\n98\nTable of Contents\nEmployee separation costs principally consist of one-time termination benefits and other post-employment benefits. One-time termination benefits are expensed at the date the\nentity notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide future service, in which case the benefits are expensed over the future service period. Other post-employment\nbenefits are expensed when the obligation is probable and the benefit amounts are estimable. Other costs associated with restructuring activities, including facility and other\nexist costs and professional fees, are expensed as they are incurred.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation for all equity awards made to employees based upon the awards’ estimated grant date fair value. For equity awards that\nvest subject to the satisfaction of service requirements, compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and expense is recognized on\na straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is typically between two to four years. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Stock-based compensation is\nclassified in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations based on the function to which the related services are provided.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of these awards,\nsuch as expected term, expected dividend yield, volatility and risk-free interest rate, represent management’s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the\napplication of management’s judgment. If actual results are not consistent with the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in making these estimates, the Company may\nbe required to increase or decrease compensation expense, which could be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations.\nThe fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted market price of the Company’s Class A common stock on\nthe date of grant.\nFor performance stock units (“PSUs”) which are subject to service and market conditions, compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the award on the date of\ngrant and expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period regardless if the market condition is satisfied. If the grantee is terminated prior to\nmeeting both conditions, any previously recognized expense is reversed. The Company estimates the fair value of PSUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The\nassumptions used in estimating the fair value of these awards, such as expected term, volatility and risk-free interest rate, represent management’s best estimates and involve\ninherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.\nFor PSUs which are subject to a performance condition, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period when the achievement of\nsuch performance condition is determined probable, and upon achieving such performance condition that was not previously considered as probable, records a cumulative\ncatch-up adjustment to reflect the portion of the grantee’s requisite service that has been provided to date. If a performance condition is not determined probable or is not met,\nno compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized expense is reversed. The fair value of such PSUs is determined based on the quoted market price of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock on the date of grant.\nUnit-Based Compensation\nUp until the IPO, MLSH 1 had granted unit-based awards to certain executives of Topco LLC who are also executives of the Company in the form of non-vested units. Topco\nLLC’s controlled subsidiary, MLSC, also granted unit-based awards only to certain employees of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Incentive Units”). All awards of Incentive\nUnits were measured based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for MLSH 1 awards in its consolidated financial\nstatements as MLSH 1 is considered to be the economic interest holder in Topco LLC. Compensation expense for the Incentive Units is recognized over their requisite service\nperiod. Forfeitures are recognized when they occur.\nThe grant date fair value of Incentive Unit awards was determined by the Company’s Board of Directors with the assistance of management and an independent third-party\nvaluation specialist.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. We are the controlling member of Topco LLC, which has been, and will continue to be, treated as a partnership for U.S.\nfederal and state income tax purposes. Topco LLC’s previously wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, Maravai Life Sciences, Inc. (“Maravai Inc.”) and its subsidiaries, were\ntaxpaying entities in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Maravai Inc.’s subsidiaries were sold and Maravai Inc. ceased to be a regarded entity and was deemed liquidated for U.S.\ntax purposes during the year ended December 31, 2021. Topco LLC’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Maravai LifeSciences International Holdings, Inc., is a taxpaying entity for\nU.S. and foreign jurisdictions and had limited activity subject to a transfer pricing arrangement during the year ended December 31, 2023. Topco LLC’s other subsidiaries are\ntreated as pass-through\n99\nTable of Contents\nentities for federal and state income tax purposes. The income or loss generated by these entities is not taxed at the LLC level. As required by U.S. tax law, income or loss\ngenerated by these LLCs passes through to their owners. As such, our tax provision consists solely of the activities of Maravai Inc. and its subsidiaries, prior to their disposal,\nand Maravai LifeSciences International Holdings, Inc., as well as our share of income or loss generated by Topco LLC.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting. Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income taxes expected to be\npayable or refundable for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax\nassets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize\nthe effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We reduce the measurement of a\ndeferred tax asset, if necessary, by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize some or all of the deferred tax asset.\nThe Company’s tax positions are subject to income tax audits. We account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when,\nbased upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Significant judgment is required in determining the accounting for\nincome taxes. In the ordinary course of business, many transactions and calculations arise where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Our judgments, assumptions and\nestimates relative to the accounting for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of future audits conducted\nby foreign and domestic tax authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of matters could be different from our assumptions and\nestimates used when determining the accounting for income taxes. Such differences, if identified in future periods, could have a material effect on the amounts recorded in our\nconsolidated financial statements. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements\nof operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any accruals that the Company believes are appropriate, as well as any related net interest and penalties.\nPayables to Related Parties Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nIn November 2020, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. The TRA provides for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2,\ncollectively, of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize from exchanges of LLC Units (together with\nthe corresponding shares of Class B common stock) for Class A common stock, as a result of (i) certain increases in the tax basis of assets of Topco LLC and its subsidiaries\nresulting from purchases or exchanges of LLC Units, (ii) certain tax attributes of the Organization Transactions and (iii) certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the\nTRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments that we make under the TRA (collectively, the “Tax Attributes”). The payment obligations under the TRA are not\nconditioned upon any LLC Unitholder maintaining a continued ownership interest in us or Topco LLC and the rights of MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 under the TRA are assignable.\nWe expect to benefit from the remaining 15% of the tax benefits, if any, that we may actually realize.\nWe accrue a liability for the payable to related parties for the TRA and a reduction to stockholders’ equity, when it is deemed probable that the Tax Attributes will be used to\nreduce our taxable income, as the contractual percentage of the benefit of Tax Attributes that we expected to receive over a period of time. The current portion, if any, of the\nliability is the amount estimated to be paid within one year of the consolidated balance sheet date. For purposes of estimating the value of the payable to related parties for the\nTRA, the tax benefit deemed realized by us and payable to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 is computed by taking 85% of the difference of between our undiscounted forecasted cash\nincome tax liability over the term of benefit of the Tax Attributes and the forecasted amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had there been no Tax\nAttributes. The TRA applies to each of our taxable years, beginning with the taxable year that the TRA is entered into. There is no maximum term for the TRA and the TRA will\ncontinue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless we exercise our right to terminate the TRA for an agreed-upon amount equal to the estimated present\nvalue of the remaining payments to be made under the agreement. We may record additional liabilities under the TRA when LLC Units of Topco LLC are exchanged in the\nfuture and as our estimates of the future utilization of the tax benefits change. If, due to a change in facts, these tax attributes are not utilized in future years, it is reasonably\npossible no amounts would be paid under the TRA. In this scenario, the reduction of the liability under the TRA would result in a benefit to our consolidated statements of\noperations. Subsequent adjustments to the payable to related parties for the TRA based on changes in anticipated future taxable income are recorded in our consolidated\nstatements of operations.\n100\nTable of Contents\nNon-Controlling Interests\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss, net assets and comprehensive (loss) income of our consolidated subsidiaries that is not allocable to the\nCompany based on our percentage of ownership of such entities.\nIn November 2020, following the completion of the Organizational Transactions, we became the sole managing member of Topco LLC. As of December 31, 2023, we held\napproximately 52.6% of the outstanding LLC Units of Topco LLC, and MLSH 1 held approximately 47.4% of the outstanding LLC Units of Topco LLC. Therefore, we report\nnon-controlling interests based on the percentage of LLC Units of Topco LLC held by MLSH 1 on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. Income or loss\nattributed to the non-controlling interest in Topco LLC is based on the LLC Units outstanding during the period for which the income or loss is generated and is presented on the\nconsolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.\nMLSH 1 is entitled to exchange LLC Units, together with an equal number of shares of our Class B common stock (together referred to as “Paired Interests”), for shares of\nClass A common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at our election, for cash, from a substantially concurrent public offering or private sale (based on the price of our Class A\ncommon stock in such public offering or private sale). As such, future exchanges of Paired Interests by MLSH 1 will result in a change in ownership and reduce or increase the\namount recorded as non-controlling interests and increase or decrease additional paid-in-capital when Topco LLC has positive or negative net assets, respectively.\nDistributions of $9.6 million, $150.2 million and $153.5 million for tax liabilities were made to MLSH 1 during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has historically operated in three reportable segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is\nevaluated regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The CODM allocates\nresources and assesses performance based upon discrete financial information at the segment level. All of our long-lived assets are located in the United States. After the\ndivestiture of Vector in September 2021, the Company no longer has the Protein Detection segment. The Company has reported the historical results of the Protein Detection\nbusiness as such discrete financial information evaluated by the CODM for the periods presented included the information for this legacy segment. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company operated in two reportable segments: Nucleic Acid Production and Biologics Safety Testing.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of these cash equivalents\napproximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits held at financial institutions and money market funds.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from customers for product sales and services. The Company’s expected credit losses are developed using an estimated\nloss rate method that considers historical collection experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nThe estimated loss rates are applied to trade receivables with similar risk characteristics such as the length of time the balance has been outstanding, liquidity and financial\nposition of the customer, and the geographic location of the customer. In certain instances, the Company may identify individual accounts receivable assets that do not share\nrisk characteristics with other accounts receivable, in which case the Company records its expected credit losses on an individual asset basis.\nThe allowance for credit losses was approximately $1.4 million and $2.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Write-offs of accounts receivable were $0.7\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2023. Write-offs of accounts receivable were not significant during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. There were $0.5\nmillion of recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2023. Recoveries were not significant during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nInventory\nInventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (weighted average cost) or net realizable value. Inventory\ncosts, which relate to the purchase or production of inventories, include materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead. The Company regularly monitors for excess and\nobsolete inventory based on its estimates of expected sales volumes, production capacity and expiration of raw materials, work-in-process and finished products, and reduces\nthe carrying value of inventory accordingly. The Company writes down inventory that has become\n101\nTable of Contents\nobsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value, and inventory in excess of expected manufacturing requirements. Any write-downs of\ninventories are charged to cost of revenue.\nA change in the estimated timing or amount of demand for the Company’s products could result in reduction to the recorded value of inventory quantities on hand. Any\nsignificant unanticipated changes in demand or unexpected quality failures could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and reported operating results. During all\nperiods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, there have been no material adjustments related to a revised estimate of our inventory valuations.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe consideration awarded to the Company by the U.S. Department of Defense is outside the scope of the contracts with customers, income tax, funded research and\ndevelopment, and contribution guidance. This is because the awarding entity is not considered to be a customer, the receipt of the funding is not predicated on the Company’s\nincome tax position, there are no refund provisions, and the entity is not receiving reciprocal value for their support provided to the Company. The Company’s elected policy is\nto recognize such assistance as a reduction to the carrying amount of the assets associated with the award when it is reasonably assured that the funding will be received as\nevidenced through the existence of an arrangement, amounts eligible for reimbursement are determinable and have been incurred or paid, the applicable conditions under the\narrangement have been met, and collectability of amounts due is reasonably assured.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nAssets Estimated Useful Life\nLeasehold improvements 12 years\nFurniture, fixtures, equipment and software 3 - 7 years\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the related lease term or useful life.\nMaintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred, while betterments or renewals are capitalized. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed\nof, the asset account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved, and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations.\nThe Company records certain government grants earned related to capital projects as a reduction to property and equipment.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not\namortized but is reviewed for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to the Company’s reporting units, which are components of our business for which discrete cash flow\ninformation is available one level below its operating segment. The Company conducts a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually and more frequently if changes in facts\nand circumstances indicate that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units may be less than carrying amount. In performing each annual impairment assessment and any\ninterim impairment assessment, the Company determines if it should qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying\namount (the qualitative impairment test). If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to\nperform the qualitative impairment test, the Company then performs a quantitative impairment test.\nThe quantitative impairment test is performed using a one-step process. The process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of a\nreporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill of the\nreporting unit is impaired and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess up to the total amount of goodwill included in the reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s finite-lived intangible assets represent purchased intangible assets and primarily consist of trade names, customer relationships, patents, and developed\ntechnology. Certain criteria are used in determining whether intangible assets acquired in a business combination must be recognized and reported separately. Finite-lived\nintangible assets are initially\n102\nTable of Contents\nrecognized at fair value, are subject to amortization and are subsequently stated at amortized cost. The Company’s finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using a method\nthat reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used. If that pattern cannot be reliably determined, the intangible\nassets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment along with other long-lived assets. Amortization related to\npatents and developed technology is allocated to cost of revenue whereas amortization associated with trade names and customer relationships is allocated to selling, general and\nadministrative expenses.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, including property and equipment, right-of-use lease assets and finite-lived intangible assets, to determine whether current\nevents or circumstances indicate that such carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If such facts or circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted\nfuture cash flows of these assets is compared to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether impairment exists. If the assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets. If we determine that events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining\nperiod of amortization or depreciation for a specific long-lived asset, its remaining estimated useful life will be revised, and the remaining carrying amount of the long-lived\nasset will be depreciated or amortized prospectively over the revised remaining estimated useful life. No impairment loss was recognized for long-lived or intangible assets for\nany period presented.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nCosts incurred in connection with obtaining new debt financing are deferred and amortized over the life of the related financing. If such financing is settled or replaced prior to\nmaturity with debt instruments that have substantially different terms, the settlement is treated as an extinguishment and the unamortized costs are charged to gain or loss on\nextinguishment of debt. If such financing is settled or replaced with debt instruments from the same lender that do not have substantially different terms, the new debt\nagreement is accounted for as a modification for the prior debt agreement and the unamortized costs remain capitalized, the new original issuance discount costs are capitalized,\nand any new third-party costs are charged to expense. Deferred costs are recognized as a direct reduction in the carrying amount of the debt instrument on the consolidated\nbalance sheets and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) and its components encompass all changes in equity other than those with stockholders or member. Comprehensive income (loss) for the\nCompany consists of foreign currency translation adjustments. There were no reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss during the periods presented.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. The Company follows accounting guidance that has a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the\nvaluation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. Instruments with readily available actively quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from actively\nquoted prices in an orderly market, will generally have a higher degree of market price transparency and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. The three\nlevels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\nLevel 2—Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace; and\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of current assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. The fair values of\nthe Company’s long-term debt approximate carrying value, excluding the effect of unamortized debt discount, as it is based on borrowing rates currently available to the\nCompany for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 inputs).\nAcquisitions\nThe Company evaluates mergers, acquisitions and other similar transactions to assess whether or not the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or an\nacquisition of assets. The Company first identifies the acquiring entity by determining if the target is a legal entity or a group of assets or liabilities. If control over a legal entity\nis being evaluated, the Company also evaluates if the target is a variable interest or voting interest entity. For acquisitions of voting interest entities, the\n103\nTable of Contents\nCompany applies a screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar\nidentifiable assets. If the screen test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an acquisition of assets. If the screen is not met, further determination is required as to whether or\nnot the Company has acquired inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs which would meet the definition of a business.\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of acquired\nbusinesses be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price, which includes the fair value of consideration transferred, is attributed to the\nfair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price may also include contingent consideration. The Company assesses whether such contingent\nconsideration is subject to liability classification and fair value measurement or meets the definition of a derivative. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at their\nestimated fair value on the acquisition date. Contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be compensatory in nature are recognized as post combination\nexpense in our consolidated statements of operations ratably over the implied service period beginning in the period it becomes probable such amounts will become payable. The\nexcess of the purchase price of the acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. The fair value of assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed twelve months from the\nacquisition date. The results of acquired businesses are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Transaction costs directly\nattributable to acquired businesses are expensed as incurred.\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation\nmethodologies and assumptions about future net cash flows, discount rates and market participants. Each of these factors can significantly affect the value attributed to the\nidentifiable intangible asset acquired in a business combination.\nContingent Consideration\nContingent consideration represents additional consideration that may be transferred to former owners of an acquired entity in the future if certain future events occur or\nconditions are met. Contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of a business is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. Such contingent consideration is re-\nmeasured to its estimated fair value at each reporting date with the change in fair value recognized within operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are classified as an adjustment to cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated\nstatements of cash flows because the change in fair value is an input in determining net (loss) income. Cash paid in settlement of contingent consideration liabilities are\nclassified as cash flows from financing activities up to the acquisition date fair value with any excess classified as cash flows from operating activities.\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with the acquisition of a business can result from updates to assumptions such as the expected timing\nor probability of achieving customer-related performance targets, specified sales milestones, changes in projected revenue or changes in discount rates. Judgment is used in\ndetermining those assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent reporting period. Therefore, any changes in the fair value will impact the Company’s results of\noperations in such reporting period, thereby resulting in potential variability in the Company’s operating results until such contingencies are resolved.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present at the inception of the arrangement and if such a\nlease is classified as a finance lease or operating lease. Finance leases with a term greater than one year are included in property and equipment, current portion of finance lease\nliabilities, and finance lease liabilities, less current portion on our consolidated balance sheets. Operating leases with a term greater than one year are included in other assets,\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The Company has elected not to recognize on the consolidated\nbalance sheet leases with terms of one year or less.\nRight-of-use (“ROU”) assets represents the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease contract. Lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease\nterm. In determining the net present value of lease payments, the interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes the\nappropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar\neconomic environment. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received and impairment charges if we\ndetermine the ROU asset is impaired.\n104\nTable of Contents\nThe Company considers a lease term to be the noncancelable period that it has the right to use the underlying asset, including any periods where it is reasonably assured the\nCompany will exercise the option to extend the contract. Periods covered by an option to extend are included in the lease term if the lessor controls the exercise of that option.\nThe Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Variable lease payments, for items such as maintenance and utilities, are not\nincluded in the calculation of the ROU asset and the related lease liability and are recognized as this lease expense is incurred.\nThe Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for its leased assets and accounts for all lease and non-lease components of its agreements as a single\nlease component. The lease components resulting in a ROU asset have been recorded on the balance sheet and amortized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. The Company\nmaintains the majority of its cash balances at multiple financial institutions that management believes are of high-credit quality and financially stable. Cash is deposited with\nmajor financial institutions in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. The Company believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk due\nto the financial strength of the depository institutions in which the cash is held. The Company provides credit, in the normal course of business, to international and domestic\ndistributors as well as certain customers, which are geographically dispersed. The Company attempts to limit its credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of its\ncustomers and maintaining adequate allowances for potential credit losses.\nThe following table summarizes revenue from each of our customers who individually accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue or accounts receivable for the periods\npresented:\nRevenue Accounts Receivable, net\nYears Ended December 31, As of December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022\nNacalai USA, Inc. 19.3 % * * 27.3 % 20.3 %\nCureVac N.V. * * 15.3 % 13.0 % 15.7 %\nBioNTech SE * 34.8 % 29.5 % * 12.0 %\nPfizer Inc. * 26.4 % 23.3 % * 19.2 %\n____________________\n* Less than 10%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, all of the revenue recorded for Nacalai USA, Inc. was generated by the Nucleic Acid Production Segment. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, substantially all of the revenue recorded for BioNTech SE and Pfizer Inc. was generated by our Nucleic Acid Production segment. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, substantially all of the revenue recorded for BioNTech SE, Pfizer Inc and CureVac N.V. was generated by our Nucleic Acid Production segment.\nNet (Loss) Income per Class A Common Share Attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.\nBasic net (loss) income per Class A common share attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to us by the\nweighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per Class A common share is calculated by giving effect to all potential\nweighted average dilutive stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and Topco LLC Units, that together with an equal number of shares of our Class B\ncommon stock are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards, if any, is reflected in diluted earnings per share by\napplication of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences\nHoldings, Inc., diluted net loss per Class A common share attributable to the Company is the same as basic net loss per Class A common share attributable to the Company,\nsince dilutive equity instruments are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company reported a net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences\nHoldings, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) -\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which improves segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant expenses. ASU 2023-07 requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each\n105\nTable of Contents\nreported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, any additional measures of a\nsegment’s profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources, and the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the\nreported measures of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU also requires all annual disclosures currently\nrequired by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements and\ndisclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). The amendments in this ASU\naddress investor requests for more transparency about income tax information through improvements to tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income\ntaxes paid information. The ASU also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective\napplication permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n2. Acquisitions and Divestiture\nAcquisitions\nAlphazyme, LLC\nOn January 18, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Alphazyme, LLC (“Alphazyme”), a privately-held original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and provider of\ncustom, scalable, molecular biology enzymes to customers in the genetic analysis and nucleic acid synthesis markets. The acquisition will expand the Company’s internal\nenzyme product portfolio and increase the Company’s differentiated mRNA manufacturing services and product offerings. Alphazyme’s ability to manufacture custom enzymes\nallows the Company to expand into near adjacent markets and raise our enzyme vertical.\nThe Company acquired Alphazyme for a total purchase consideration of $75.3 million, which is inclusive of net working capital adjustments. As a result of the acquisition, the\nCompany owns all the outstanding equity interest in Alphazyme. The total cash consideration was paid using existing cash on hand. The transaction was accounted for as an\nacquisition of a business as Alphazyme consisted of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that had the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $4.1 million in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Alphazyme, which were recorded within\nselling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred to acquire Alphazyme consisted of the following (in thousands):\nCash paid (1) $ 70,037\nFair value of contingent consideration 5,289\nTotal consideration transferred $ 75,326\n____________________\n(1) Represents cash consideration paid at closing of $70.1 million, net of a purchase price adjustment received in June 2023 of $0.1 million.\nPursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Alphazyme SPA”) between the Company and sellers of Alphazyme, additional payments to the sellers of Alphazyme are\ndependent upon meeting or exceeding defined revenue targets during fiscal years 2023 through 2025 (the “Alphazyme Performance Payments”). The Alphazyme SPA provides\nfor a total maximum Alphazyme Performance Payments of $75.0 million. The Alphazyme Performance Payments were recorded as contingent consideration and was included\nas part of the purchase consideration. The Company estimated the fair value of the Alphazyme Performance Payments contingent consideration based on a Monte-Carlo\nsimulation model which utilized an income approach. The estimated fair value was based on Alphazyme revenue projections, expected payout term, volatility and risk adjusted\ndiscount rates which are Level 3 inputs (see Note 5). The first performance period applicable to the Alphazyme Performance Payments ended on December 31, 2023, and it was\ndetermined that the defined revenue target was not achieved. Consequently, no payment was made to the sellers of Alphazyme.\n106\nTable of Contents\nThe Alphazyme SPA also provides that the Company will pay certain employees of Alphazyme an additional amount totaling $9.3 million (the “Alphazyme Retention\nPayments”) as of various dates but primarily through December 31, 2025 as long as these individuals continue to be employed by the Company. The Company considers the\npayment of the Alphazyme Retention Payments as probable and is recognizing compensation expense related to these payments in the post-acquisition period ratably over the\nservice period of approximately three years. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $2.2 million of compensation expense related to the Alphazyme\nRetention Payments within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Compensation expense related to the Alphazyme Retention\nPayments recorded within cost of revenue and research and development expenses were not material.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands):\nCash $ 288\nInventory 7,246\nOther current assets 660\nIntangible assets, net 31,680\nOther assets 5,043\nTotal identifiable assets acquired 44,917\nCurrent liabilities (482)\nOther long-term liabilities (11,470)\nTotal liabilities assumed (11,952)\nNet identifiable assets acquired 32,965\nGoodwill 42,361\nNet assets acquired $ 75,326\nWe recorded the preliminary purchase price allocation in the first quarter of 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, we recorded a measurement period adjustment resulting in a\ndecrease to goodwill of $0.4 million, with an equal offset to other long-term liabilities.\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, and therefore, the total purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible\nassets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Purchase consideration in excess of the amounts recognized for the net\nassets acquired was recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expanded synergies expected from the acquisition associated with a vertical supply integration.\nAll of the goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme was allocated to the Company’s Nucleic Acid Production segment. None of the goodwill\nrecognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nUpon closing of the acquisition, approximately $1.5 million was placed into escrow to cover potential working capital adjustments and approximately $3.0 million was placed\ninto escrow to secure certain representations and warranties pursuant to the terms of the Alphazyme SPA. These amounts are included in the total purchase consideration of\n$75.3 million. The $1.5 million was released from escrow during the second quarter of 2023, of which the Company received $0.1 million related to net working capital\nadjustments. Because the remaining $3.0 million held in escrow is not controlled by the Company, this amount is not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet\nas of December 31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of Alphazyme’s identifiable intangible assets as of the date of acquisition and their estimated useful lives:\nEstimated Fair Value Estimated Useful Life\n(in thousands) (in years)\nTrade names $ 220 5\nDeveloped technology 31,000 12\nCustomer relationships 460 12\nTotal $ 31,680\n107\nTable of Contents\nThe trade name and customer relationship intangible assets are related to Alphazyme’s name, customer loyalty and customer relationships. The developed technology intangible\nasset is related to its unique manufacturing process optimization capability to both scale production and achieve quality standards. The fair value of these intangible assets was\nbased on Alphazyme’s projected revenues and was estimated using an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method for trade names, the multi-period excess\nearnings method for developed technology, and the distributor method for customer relationships. Under the income approach, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the\npresent value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset. The estimated fair value was developed by discounting future net cash flows to their present\nvalue at market-based rates of return utilizing Level 3 inputs. The useful lives for these intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining period for which the assets\nwere expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows. Key quantitative assumptions used in the determination of fair value of the developed technology\nintangible included revenue growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 55.0%, a discount rate of 17.8% and an assumed technical obsolescent curve of 5.0%.\nThe carrying value of the remaining assets acquired or liabilities assumed was estimated to equal their fair values based on their short-term nature. These estimates were based\non the assumption that the Company believes to be reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nMyChem, LLC\nOn January 27, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of MyChem, LLC (“MyChem”), a privately-held San Diego, California-based provider of ultra-pure nucleotides\nto customers in the diagnostics, pharma, genomics and research markets. The acquisition will vertically integrate the Company’s supply chain and expand its product offerings\nfor inputs used in the development of therapeutics and vaccines.\nThe Company acquired MyChem for a total purchase consideration of $257.9 million, which is inclusive of net working capital adjustments. As a result of the acquisition, the\nCompany owns all the outstanding equity interest in MyChem. The total cash consideration was paid using existing cash on hand. The transaction was accounted for as an\nacquisition of a business as MyChem consisted of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that had the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $3.5 million in transaction costs associated with the acquisition of MyChem, which were recorded within selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe acquisition date fair value of consideration transferred to acquire MyChem consisted of the following (in thousands):\nCash paid (1) $ 240,145\nConsideration payable 10,000\nFair value of contingent consideration 7,800\nTotal consideration transferred $ 257,945\n____________________\n(1) Represents cash consideration paid at closing of $240.0 million and a purchase price adjustment paid in November 2022 of $0.1 million.\nPursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “MyChem SPA”) between the Company and sellers of MyChem, additional payments to the sellers of MyChem are\ndependent upon meeting or exceeding defined revenue targets during fiscal 2022 (the “MyChem Performance Payment”). The MyChem SPA provides for a total maximum\nPerformance Payment of $40.0 million. The MyChem Performance Payment was recorded as contingent consideration and was included as part of the purchase consideration.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the MyChem Performance Payment contingent consideration based on a Monte-Carlo simulation model which utilized an income\napproach. The estimated fair value was based on MyChem revenue projections, expected payout term, volatility and risk adjusted discount rates which are Level 3 inputs (see\nNote 5). The performance period applicable to the MyChem Performance Payment ended as of December 31, 2022 and it was determined that none of the defined revenue\nthresholds were achieved. Consequently, no payment was made to the sellers of MyChem.\nThe MyChem SPA also provides that the Company will pay to the sellers of MyChem an additional $20.0 million (the “MyChem Retention Payment”) as of the second\nanniversary of the closing of the acquisition date as long as two senior employees who are also the sellers of MyChem continue to be employed by TriLink. The Company\nconsiders the payment of the Retention Payment as probable and is recognizing compensation expense related to this payment in the post-acquisition period ratably over the\nexpected service period of two years. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $4.3 million of compensation expense related to the MyChem Retention\nPayment within cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $5.1 million and $9.3\n108\nTable of Contents\nmillion, respectively, of compensation expense related to the MyChem Retention Payment within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nThe MyChem SPA further provides that the Company will pay to the sellers of MyChem an additional amount of up to $10.0 million subject to the completion of certain\ncalculations associated with acquired inventory, which has been recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December\n31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, but subsequent to the end of the measurement period, these calculations were completed and a payment of $9.7 million was made by\nthe Company to the sellers. The remaining $0.3 million was recorded as non-cash gain within current year operations.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date (in thousands):\nCash $ 1,176\nCurrent assets 2,741\nIntangible assets, net 123,360\nOther assets 8,585\nTotal identifiable assets acquired 135,862\nCurrent liabilities (420)\nOther long-term liabilities (8,399)\nTotal liabilities assumed (8,819)\nNet identifiable assets acquired 127,043\nGoodwill 130,902\nNet assets acquired $ 257,945\nWe recorded the preliminary purchase price allocation in the first quarter of 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded measurement period adjustments resulting in\nan increase to goodwill of $0.1 million and a decrease to other assets and current liabilities of $0.7 million.\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, and therefore, the total purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible\nassets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Purchase consideration in excess of the amounts recognized for the net\nassets acquired was recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expanded synergies expected from the acquisition associated with a vertical supply integration.\nThere were no tax impacts associated with the acquisition due to the pass-through income tax treatment of MyChem. All of the goodwill acquired in connection with the\nacquisition of MyChem was allocated to the Company’s Nucleic Acid Production segment and is deductible to Topco LLC for income tax purposes.\nUpon closing of the acquisition, approximately $1.0 million was placed into escrow to cover potential working capital adjustments and approximately $12.5 million was placed\ninto escrow to secure certain representations and warranties pursuant to the terms of the MyChem SPA. These amounts are included in the total purchase consideration of $257.9\nmillion. The Company released the $1.0 million in escrow and paid out an additional $0.1 million related to net working capital adjustments during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, but subsequent to the end of the measurement period, $12.4 million of the amounts in escrow to secure certain representations and warranties\nwas released to the sellers and the remaining $0.1 million was released to the Company for indemnification of pre-closing liabilities, which was recorded within current year\noperations.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of MyChem’s identifiable intangible assets as of the date of acquisition and their estimated useful lives:\nEstimated Fair Value Estimated Useful Life\n(in thousands) (in years)\nTrade names $ 460 3\nDeveloped technology 121,000 12\nCustomer relationships 1,900 12\nTotal $ 123,360\n109\nTable of Contents\nThe trade name and customer relationship intangible assets are related to MyChem’s name, customer loyalty and customer relationships. The developed technology intangible\nasset is related to processes and techniques for synthesizing and developing ultra-pure nucleotides. The fair value of these intangible assets was based on MyChem’s projected\nrevenues and was estimated using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. Under the income approach, an intangible asset’s fair value is\nequal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset. The estimated fair value was developed by discounting future net cash flows to\ntheir present value at market-based rates of return utilizing Level 3 inputs. The useful lives for these intangible assets were determined based upon the remaining period for\nwhich the assets were expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows. Key quantitative assumptions used in the determination of fair value of the developed\ntechnology intangible included revenue growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 30.6%, a discount rate of 16.5% and an assumed technical obsolescent curve range of 5.0% to 7.5%.\nPursuant to the terms of the MyChem SPA, the Company recognized an indemnification asset of $8.0 million within other assets, which represented the seller’s obligation to\nreimburse pre-acquisition income tax liabilities assumed in the acquisition and was recorded within other long-term liabilities.\nThe carrying value of the remaining assets acquired or liabilities assumed was estimated to equal their fair values based on their short-term nature.\nDivestiture\nVector Laboratories, Inc.\nIn August 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell Vector to Voyager Group Holdings, Inc. (“Voyager”), a third-party unrelated to the Company, for an all\ncash sale price of $124.0 million, subject to purchase price adjustments. The Company determined that the fair value of Vector, less estimated costs to sell, exceeded the book\nvalue of the Vector Disposal Group and there were no other indicators of asset impairment prior to the sale. The divestiture was completed in September 2021, and final net\nproceeds were $120.7 million, which were inclusive of working capital adjustments.\nAs a result of the divestiture, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $11.2 million, net of transactions costs of $0.9\nmillion, in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company’s Protein Detection segment was comprised of Vector. The sale of Vector represents a strategic shift as the Company will no longer be in the protein detection\nbusiness after the sale. However, the sale did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations since the sale of the Protein Detection segment did not have a major effect\non the Company’s operations or financial results.\nIn connection with the divestiture, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”) with Voyager to help support its ongoing operations. Under the TSA, the\nCompany will provide certain transition services to Voyager, including information technology, finance and ERP, marketing and commercial, human resources, employee\nbenefits, and other limited services. Depending on the service, the initial period ranges from one month to five months and the extension period ranges from one month to eight\nmonths. Income from performing services under the TSA was recorded within other income in the consolidated statements of operations and was not significant for the year\nended December 31, 2021.\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with an executive of Vector whereby the executive received incentive units of MLSH 1. In connection with the\ndivestiture, MLSH 1 amended this executive’s incentive units resulting in the recognition of incremental unit-based compensation expense in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements of $2.4 million. This unit-based compensation expense was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of\noperations for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n3. Restructuring\nIn November 2023, the Company implemented a cost realignment plan (the “Cost Realignment Plan”) that included the termination of approximately1 5% of the Company’s\nworkforce, the termination of certain leases, and other actions to reduce expenses, all as part of a plan to optimize business operations and match them to current market\nconditions. The reduction in force was completed on January 5, 2024, following the end of the sixty-day notification period required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining\nNotification Act. The Company expects the remaining actions under the Cost Realignment Plan to be substantially complete during the first quarter of 2024.\n110\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s restructuring charges by segment and unallocated corporate costs, which are recorded as restructuring expenses on the consolidated statements of operations,\nwere as follows for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nStock-Based\nSeverance and Other Compensation Facility and Other Professional Fees and\nEmployee Costs Expense (Benefit) Exit Costs Other Total\nNucleic Acid Production $ 2,470 $ 168 $ 638 $ 190 $ 3,466\nCorporate 1,833 (269) 1,351 85 3,000\nTotal $ 4,303 $ (101) $ 1,989 $ 275 $ 6,466\nThe following table summarizes the activity for accrued restructuring costs, which is recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets, for the period presented (in thousands):\nStock-Based\nSeverance and Other Compensation Expense Facility and Other Professional Fees and\nEmployee Costs (Benefit) Exit Costs Other Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCharges 4,303 (101) 1,989 275 6,466\nNon-cash charges — 101 — — 101\nCash payments (1,760) — (1,989) (4) (3,753)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,543 $ — $ — $ 271 $ 2,814\nThe Company does not expect to incur additional restructuring costs relating to the Cost Realignment Plan, however the Company expects an additional benefit totaling $1.2\nmillion for the forfeiture of equity awards upon the termination of certain impacted employees in January 2024, of which $0.8 million relates to the Nucleic Acid Production\nsegment and $0.4 million relates to unallocated corporate costs.\n4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company’s goodwill of $326.0 million and $283.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, represents the excess of purchase consideration over the fair\nvalue of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had four reporting units, three of which are contained in the Nucleic Acid Production\nsegment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded goodwill of $42.4 million in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme that was completed in\nJanuary 2023 (see Note 2). As of December 31, 2022, the Company had three reporting units, two of which were contained in the Nucleic Acid Production segment.\nDue to the sustained decline in its stock price and the announcement of the Cost Realignment Plan in November 2023, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill\nimpairment analysis on each of its four reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2023 and concluded that the fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value. The\nCompany has not recognized any goodwill impairment charges in any of the periods presented.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the Company’s goodwill by segment for the period presented (in thousands):\nNucleic Acid Production Biologics Safety Testing Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 163,740 $ 119,928 $ 283,668\nAcquisition 42,361 — 42,361\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 206,101 $ 119,928 $ 326,029\nIntangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis, which reflects the expected pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being obtained, over\nan estimated useful life ranging from 3 to 14 years.\n111\nTable of Contents\nThe following are components of finite-lived intangible assets and accumulated amortization as of the periods presented (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted\nAverage\nGross Net Estimated Remaining\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Useful Amortization\nAmount Amortization Amount Life Period\n(in thousands) (in years) (in years)\nTrade Names $ 7,800 $ 6,369 $ 1,431 3 - 10 2.8\nPatents and Developed Technology 319,649 109,800 209,849 10 - 14 8.9\nCustomer Relationships 22,313 12,606 9,707 10 - 12 5.9\nTotal $ 349,762 $ 128,775 $ 220,987 8.7\nDecember 31, 2022\nWeighted\nAverage\nGross Net Estimated Remaining\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Useful Amortization\nAmount Amortization Amount Life Period\n(in thousands) (in years) (in years)\nTrade Names $ 7,580 $ 5,746 $ 1,834 3 - 10 3.5\nPatents and Developed Technology 288,649 85,058 203,591 10 - 14 9.5\nCustomer Relationships 21,853 10,615 11,238 10 - 12 6.5\nTotal $ 318,082 $ 101,419 $ 216,663 9.3\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded intangible assets of $31.7 million in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme that was completed in January 2023\n(see Note 2).\nThe Company recognized $24.8 million, $21.5 million and $12.4 million of amortization expense from intangible assets directly linked with revenue generating activities\nwithin cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of\nthe periods presented (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nMoney market funds $ 418,685 $ — $ — $ 418,685\nInterest rate cap — 8,559 — 8,559\nTotal assets $ 418,685 $ 8,559 $ — $ 427,244\nLiabilities\nCurrent portion of contingent consideration $ — $ — $ 131 $ 131\nContingent consideration, non-current — — 1,872 1,872\nTotal liabilities $ — $ — $ 2,003 $ 2,003\nFair Value Measurements as of December 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nInterest rate cap $ — $ 11,362 $ — $ 11,362\nContingent Consideration\nIn connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme (see Note 2), the Company is required to make contingent payments to the sellers of up to $75.0 million, subject to achieving\ncertain revenue thresholds. The preliminary fair value of the liability for the contingent payments recognized upon the acquisition as part of the purchase accounting opening\nbalance sheet totaled $5.3 million. The preliminary fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation-based model discounted to\npresent value. Assumptions used in this calculation are expected revenue, a discount rate of 17.8% and various probability factors. The ultimate settlement of the contingent\nconsideration could deviate from current estimates based on the actual results of these financial measures. The contingent consideration has three performance payments\nspanning over three years beginning 2024. This liability is considered to be a Level 3 financial liability that is remeasured each reporting period. Changes in fair value of\ncontingent consideration are recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of\noperations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a decrease of $3.3 million in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. This was due to\na change in estimates associated with Alphazyme revenue projections reaching thresholds that would trigger a contingent payment per the Alphazyme SPA.\nIn connection with the acquisition of MyChem (see Note 2), the Company is required to make contingent payments to the sellers of up to $40.0 million, subject to achieving\ncertain revenue thresholds. The preliminary fair value of the liability for the contingent payments recognized upon the acquisition as part of the purchase accounting opening\nbalance sheet totaled $7.8 million. The preliminary fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation-based model discounted to\npresent value. Assumptions used in this calculation are expected revenue, a discount rate of 16.9% and various probability factors. The ultimate settlement of the contingent\nconsideration could deviate from current estimates based on the actual results of these financial measures. The contingent consideration projected year of payment was 2023.\nThis liability is considered to be a Level 3 financial liability that is remeasured each reporting period. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized as a gain\nor loss and recorded within change in estimated fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations. During the second quarter of 2022, the\nCompany recorded a $7.8 million decrease in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration. This was due to a change in the estimate associated with MyChem revenue\nprojections reaching thresholds that would trigger a contingent payment per the MyChem SPA. The contingent consideration expired as of December 31, 2022 and the revenue\nthresholds were not achieved.\n113\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the periods presented\n(in thousands):\nContingent Consideration\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ —\nContingent consideration related to the acquisition of MyChem 7,800\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (7,800)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 —\nContingent consideration related to the acquisition of Alphazyme 5,289\nChange in estimated fair value of contingent consideration (3,286)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,003\n6.

Government Assistance\nCooperative Agreement\nIn May 2022, TriLink entered into a cooperative agreement (the “Cooperative Agreement”) with the U.S. Department of Defense, as represented by the Joint Program Executive\nOffice for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense on behalf of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”), within the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), to advance the development of domestic manufacturing capabilities and to expand TriLink’s domestic production capacity\nin its San Diego manufacturing campus (the “Flanders San Diego Facility”) for products critical to the development and manufacture of mRNA vaccines and therapeutics. The\nCooperative Agreement has since transitioned from the U.S. Department of Defense to the HHS as of January 2023. The Flanders San Diego Facility consists of two buildings\n(“Flanders I” and “Flanders II”), however, the Cooperative Agreement is exclusively involved in Flanders I.\n115\nTable of Contents\nThe Cooperative Agreement requires the Company to provide the U.S. Government with conditional priority access and certain preferred pricing obligations for a 10-year period\nfrom the completion of the construction project for the production of a medical countermeasure (or a component thereof) that the Company manufactures in the Flanders San\nDiego Facility during a declared public health emergency.\nPursuant to certain requirements, BARDA awarded TriLink an amount equal to $38.8 million or 50% of the construction and validation costs currently budgeted for the\nFlanders San Diego Facility. The contract period of performance is May 2022 through January 2034, which is the effective date of the Cooperative Agreement through the\nanticipated expiration of the 10-year conditional priority access period. Amounts reimbursed are subject to audit and may be recaptured by the HHS in certain circumstances.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has received $12.9 million of reimbursements under the Cooperative Agreement with an equal offset recorded to\nproperty and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded a receivable of $1.1 million, with an equal offset to property\nand equipment on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has received $18.1 million of reimbursements under the Cooperative Agreement, with offsets recorded to: (i) prepaid\nlease payments associated with Flanders I within other assets of $17.0 million; and (ii) property and equipment of $1.1 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has\nrecorded a receivable of $8.2 million, with an equal offset recorded to prepaid lease payments associated with Flanders I within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\n8. Leases\nAll of the Company's facilities, including office, laboratory and manufacturing space, are occupied under long-term non-cancelable lease arrangements with various expiration\ndates through 2038, some of which include options to extend up to 20 years. The Company does not have any leases that include residual value guarantees.\nIn January 2023, the Company assumed Alphazyme’s existing facility lease in Jupiter, Florida, in connection with the acquisition of Alphazyme (see Note 2). The lease term\nbegan in January 2023 and will end in January 2032. The lease is for 10 years with the option to extend for one additional 5-year period.\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to expand the existing Alphazyme facility lease for additional space. The lease term will run concurrently with and as\npart of the initial lease term.\nIn March 2023 and June 2023, the Company’s leases for Flanders I and Flanders II, respectively, commenced. The Company entered into the lease agreement in August 2021.\nThe leases are for eleven years with the option to extend for one additional 5-year period. The Company is reasonably certain to execute the renewal option and has, therefore,\nrecognized this as part of its ROU assets and lease liabilities. The lease includes tenant improvement provisions, rent abatement clauses, and escalating rent payments over the\nlife of the lease.\nIn December 2023, as part of the Cost Realignment Plan, the Company terminated a facility lease in San Diego, California and recorded a non-cash loss for early lease\ntermination in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 3).\nThe Company has a $0.5 million outstanding letter of credit as security for a lease agreement for a facility in San Diego, California, which reduced the availability of credit\nunder the Revolving Credit Facility (see Note 10).\n116\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company's leases as of the periods presented below (in thousands):\nLine Item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRight-of-use assets\nFinance leases Property and equipment, net $ 75,382 $ —\nOperating leases Other assets 59,746 63,896\nTotal right-of-use assets $ 135,128 $ 63,896\nCurrent lease liabilities\nFinance leases Current portion of finance lease liabilities $ 633 $ —\nOperating leases Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 6,780 6,269\nTotal current lease liabilities $ 7,413 $ 6,269\nNon-current lease liabilities\nFinance leases Finance lease liabilities, less current portion $ 31,897 $ —\nOperating leases Other long-term liabilities 47,510 51,556\nTotal non-current lease liabilities $ 79,407 $ 51,556\nThe components of the net lease costs reflected in the Company's consolidated statements of operations were as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nFinance lease costs:\nDepreciation of leased assets $ 3,217 $ — $ —\nInterest on lease liabilities 1,696 — —\nTotal finance lease costs 4,913 — —\nOperating lease costs 12,417 8,800 8,792\nVariable lease costs 3,940 2,742 1,759\nTotal lease costs $ 21,270 $ 11,542 $ 10,551\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate related to the Company's ROU assets and lease liabilities for its leases were as follows as of the\nperiods presented below:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years):\nFinance leases 14.2 *\nOperating leases 7.3 7.9\nWeighted average discount rate:\nFinance leases 8.4 % *\nOperating leases 6.7 % 6.5 %\n____________________\n* The Company did not have any finance leases as of December 31, 2022.\n117\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental information concerning the cash flow impact arising from the Company's leases recorded in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows is detailed in the\nfollowing table for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in lease liabilities:\nFinancing cash flows used for finance leases $ 332 $ — $ —\nOperating cash flows used for finance leases 1,696 — —\nOperating cash flows used for operating leases 10,306 7,049 6,335\nNon-cash transactions:\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities $ 32,862 $ — $ —\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 3,931 17,513 —\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company expects that its future minimum lease payments will become due and payable as follows (in thousands):\nFinance Leases Operating Leases Total\n2024 $ 3,327 $ 10,224 $ 13,551\n2025 3,427 10,392 13,819\n2026 3,530 10,039 13,569\n2027 3,636 8,561 12,197\n2028 3,745 8,666 12,411\nThereafter 40,357 25,432 65,789\nTotal minimum lease payments 58,022 73,314 131,336\nLess: interest (25,492) (19,024) (44,516)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 32,530 $ 54,290 $ 86,820\n9. Commitments and Contingencies\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are\nenforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include provisions with respect to quantities, pricing and timing of purchases.\nAmounts purchased under these obligations totaled $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Such amounts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022\nand 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2023, future minimum commitments under these obligations totaled $3.3 million which relates to the year ending December 31, 2024.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The Company accrues for a loss contingency when it determines that it is\nprobable, after consultation with counsel, that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes that the results of\nany such contingencies, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or\ncash flows.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, customers and other parties with respect to certain matters\nincluding, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or\n118\nTable of Contents\nfrom intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties, and losses arising from breach of representations, warranties and covenants to counterparties set forth in\nagreements with such parties. We have also agreed to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under applicable state laws pursuant to standard director and\nofficer indemnification agreements and our corporate charter and bylaws. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these\nindemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. We have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and are not currently aware of any\nindemnification claims.\n10. Long-Term Debt\nCredit Agreement\nIn October 2020, Maravai Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“Intermediate”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Topco LLC, along with certain of its subsidiaries (together with\nIntermediate, the “Borrowers”), entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), which provides for a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility. In\nJanuary 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to refinance the term loan and to replace London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) with a Term\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based rate.\nAs amended, the Credit Agreement provides for a $600.0 million term loan facility, maturing October 2027 (the “Tranche B Term Loan”), and a $180.0 million revolving credit\nfacility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). The interest rate margins applicable to the Tranche B Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility is 3.00%, with respect to each Term\nSOFR-based loan, and 2.00%, with respect to each Base Rate-based loan. Further, the interest rate floor for Base Rate term loans, Term SOFR-based term loans, and Term\nSOFR-based revolving loans are 1.50%, 0.50% and 0.00%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the Tranche B Term Loan was8 .40% per annum.\nThe Credit Agreement also provides for a $20.0 million limit for letters of credit. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a $0.5 million outstanding letter of credit as\nsecurity for a lease agreement, which reduced the availability of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility by $0.5 million.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by Topco LLC, together with the existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of Topco LLC\n(subject to certain exceptions), as specified in the respective guaranty agreements. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are also secured by a first-priority lien and security\ninterest in substantially all of the assets (subject to certain exceptions) of existing and future material domestic subsidiaries of Topco LLC that are loan parties.\nThe accounting related to entering into the Amendment was evaluated on a creditor-by-creditor basis to determine whether each transaction should be accounted for as a\nmodification or extinguishment. Certain creditors under the Tranche B Term Loan did not participate in this refinancing transaction, were repaid their principal and interest of\n$8.5 million and ceased being creditors of the Company and the repayment of their related outstanding debt balances has been accounted for as an extinguishment of debt.\nProceeds of borrowings from new lenders of $8.5 million were accounted for as a new debt financing. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.2 million\nin the accompanying consolidated statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2022. For the remainder of the creditors, this transaction was accounted for as a\nmodification because the change in present value of cash flows between the two term loans before and after the transaction was less than 10% on a creditor-by-creditor basis. As\npart of the refinancing, the Company incurred $0.9 million of various costs, of which an insignificant amount was related to an original issuance discount, and were all\ncapitalized in the accompanying balance sheet within long-term debt and are subject to amortization over the term of the refinanced debt as an adjustment to interest expense\nusing the effective interest method.\nWe also incurred $0.3 million of financing-related fees related to the Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the debt refinancing activities in January 2022. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, unamortized debt issuance costs totaled $1.4 million and are recorded as assets within other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as there\nis no balance outstanding related to the Revolving Credit Facility.\nCommencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Credit Agreement requires that we make mandatory prepayments on the\nTranche B Term Loan principal upon certain excess cash flow, subject to certain step-downs based on the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio. The excess cash flow shall be\nreduced to 25% or 0% of the calculated excess cash flow if the Company’s first lien net leverage ratio was equal to or less than4 .75:1.00 or 4.25:1.00, respectively, however, no\nprepayment shall be required to the extent excess cash flow calculated for the respective period is equal to or less than $10.0 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s\nfirst lien net leverage ratio was less than 4.25:1.00. Thus, a mandatory prepayment on the Tranche B Term Loan out of our excess cash flow was not required.\nThe Tranche B Term Loan is repayable in quarterly payments of $1.4 million which began in March 2022, with all remaining outstanding principal due in October 2027. The\nTranche B Term Loan includes prepayment provisions that allow the Company,\n119\nTable of Contents\nat our option, to repay all or a portion of the principal amount at any time. The Revolving Credit Facility allows the Company to repay and borrow from time to time until\nOctober 2025, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, we are required to repay borrowings under the Tranche B Term\nLoan and Revolving Credit Facility with the proceeds of certain occurrences, such as the incurrence of debt, certain equity contributions and certain asset sales or dispositions.\nAccrued interest under the Credit Agreement is payable by us (a) quarterly in arrears with respect to Base Rate loans, (b) at the end of each interest rate period (or at each three-\nmonth interval in the case of loans with interest periods greater than three months) with respect to Term SOFR Rate loans, (c) on the date of any repayment or prepayment and\n(d) at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). An annual commitment fee is applied to the daily unutilized amount under the Revolving Credit Facility at 0.375% per\nannum, with one stepdown to 0.25% per annum based on Intermediate’s first lien net leverage ratio calculation.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including, among other things, covenants limiting our ability to incur or prepay certain indebtedness, pay dividends or\ndistributions, dispose of assets, engage in mergers and consolidations, make acquisitions or other investments and make changes to the nature of the business. Additionally, the\nCredit Agreement also requires us to maintain a certain net leverage ratio if the outstanding debt balance on the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 35.0% of the aggregate\namount of available credit of $180.0 million. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2023.\nInterest Rate Cap\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement to manage a portion of its variable interest rate risk on its outstanding long-term debt. The\ncontract, which was effective March 31, 2021, entitles the Company to receive from the counterparty at each calendar quarter end the amount, if any, by which a specified\ndefined floating market rate exceeds the cap strike interest rate, applied to the contract’s notional amount of $415.0 million The floating rate of interest is reset at the end of each\nthree month period. The contract was set to expire on March 31, 2023.\nIn May 2022, the Company amended the interest rate cap agreement, effective June 30, 2022, to increase the contract’s notional amount to $500.0 million and to extend the\nmaturity date to January 19, 2025. Additionally, the floating rate option changed from a LIBOR-based rate to a SOFR-based rate. Other provisions remained unchanged as a\nresult of the amendment. Premiums paid to amend the interest rate cap agreement were immaterial.\nThe interest rate cap agreement has not been designated as a hedging relationship and has been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value of $8.6 million within\nother assets with changes in fair value recognized within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Proceeds from the interest rate cap agreement are\nreflected in cash flows used in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe Company’s long-term debt consisted of the following as of the periods presented (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nTranche B Term Loan $ 533,120 $ 538,560\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (8,973) (11,123)\nTotal long-term debt 524,147 527,437\nLess: current portion (5,440) (5,440)\nTotal long-term debt, less current portion $ 518,707 $ 521,997\nThere were no balances outstanding on the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate future principal maturities of the Company’s debt obligations based on contractual due dates were as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 5,440\n2025 5,440\n2026 5,440\n2027 516,800\nTotal long-term debt $ 533,120\n120\nTable of Contents\n11. Stockholders’ Equity\nAmendment and Restatement of Certificate of Incorporation\nIn November 2020, in connection with the Organizational Transactions, the Company’s certificate of incorporation was amended and restated to, among other things, provide\nfor the (i) authorization of 500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share; (ii) authorization of 300,000,000 shares of Class B common stock\nwith a par value of $0.01 per share; (iii) authorization of 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share.\nHolders of Class A and Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Except as otherwise required in the Certificate of Incorporation or by applicable law, the\nholders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are generally entitled to vote. Holders of\nthe Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, and upon the Company’s dissolution or liquidation, after payment in full of all amounts required to be paid to\ncreditors and to the holders of preferred stock having liquidation preferences, if any, the holders of shares of Class A common stock will be entitled to receive the Company’s\npro rata remaining assets available for distribution.

We may issue\nshares of Class B common stock only to the extent necessary to maintain these ratios. Shares of Class B common stock are transferable only together with an equal number of\nLLC Units if we, at the election of MLSH 1, exchange LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock. All Class B common stock that is transferred shall be automatically\nretired and cancelled and shall no longer be outstanding.\nExchanges and Secondary Offerings\nApril 2021 Exchange and Secondary Offering\nIn April 2021, MLSH 1 executed an exchange of 17,665,959 Topco LLC units (the “LLC Units”) (paired with the corresponding shares of Class B common stock) in return for\n17,665,959 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock. The corresponding shares of Class B common stock were subsequently cancelled and retired. The Company\nimmediately completed a secondary offering (“April 2021 Secondary Offering”) of 20,700,000 shares of its Class A common stock by MLSH 1 and Maravai Life Sciences\nHoldings 2, LLC (“MLSH 2”), which included 3,034,041 shares of Class A common stock previously held by MLSH 2, which included the full exercise of the underwriters’\noption to purchase up to 2,700,000 additional shares of Class A common stock, at a price of $31.25 per share.\nThe selling stockholders were responsible for the underwriting discounts and commissions of the April 2021 Secondary Offering and received all of the net proceeds of $624.2\nmillion from the sale of shares of Class A common stock. The Company was responsible for the offering costs associated with the April 2021 Secondary Offering of $1.0\nmillion which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSeptember 2021 Exchange and Secondary Offering\nIn September 2021, MLSH 1 executed an exchange of 17,068,559 LLC Units (paired with the corresponding shares of Class B common stock) in return for1 7,068,559 shares\nof the Company’s Class A common stock.

Shortly after the exchange, the\nCompany completed a secondary offering (“September 2021 Secondary Offering”) of 20,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock by MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, which\nincluded 2,931,441 shares of Class A common stock previously held by MLSH 2 at a price of $50.00 per share.\nThe selling stockholders were responsible for the underwriting discounts and commissions of the September 2021 Secondary Offering and received all of the net proceeds of\n$977.5 million from the sale of shares of Class A common stock. The Company was responsible for the offering costs associated with the September 2021 Secondary Offering\nof $0.9 million which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nCash Contribution, Exchange, and Forfeiture Agreement\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a Cash Contribution, Exchange and Forfeiture Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with Topco LLC and MLSH 1, a\nrelated party. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, the Company contributed $110.0 million of cash to Topco LLC in exchange for 2,732,919 newly-issued units LLC Units\nof Topco LLC at a price per unit of $40.25, which was equal to the 50-day volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock as\n121\nTable of Contents\ncalculated on December 31, 2021. Immediately following the contribution, the Company and MLSH 1 agreed to forfeit 2.036% of their respective LLC Units of Topco LLC\nand an equal number of shares of the Company’s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for no consideration. The purpose of the Contribution Agreement was to\nreduce the excess cash that had accumulated at the Company as a result of quarterly tax distributions it has received from Topco LLC since its IPO.\nStructuring Transactions\nIn connection with the Company’s acquisition of Alphazyme (see Note 2), the Company undertook a series of structuring transactions (the “Structuring Transactions”),\nincluding:\n• On January 18, 2023, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Alphazyme (see Note 2).\n• On January 19, 2023, the Company entered into a contribution agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with Alphazyme Holdings, Inc. (“Alphazyme Holdings”), a\nwholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which the Company contributed all such membership interests in Alphazyme (the “Alphazyme Membership\nInterest”) to Alphazyme Holdings.\n• On January 22, 2023, Alphazyme Holdings entered into a contribution and exchange agreement (the “Contribution and Exchange Agreement”) with Topco LLC,\npursuant to which it contributed all of the Alphazyme Membership Interests to TopCo LLC in exchange for 5,059,134 newly-issued LLC Units of Topco LLC at a price\nper unit of $13.87, which was equal to the 50-day volume-weighted average price of the Company’s Class A common stock as calculated on January 18, 2023 (the\n“Contribution and Exchange”).\n• Immediately following the Contribution and Exchange, the Company entered into a forfeiture agreement (the “Forfeiture Agreement”) with Alphazyme Holdings, TopCo\nLLC and MLSH 1, a related party, pursuant to which each of the Company (together with Alphazyme Holdings) and MLSH 1 agreed to forfeit 5,059,134 and 4,871,970\nLLC Units, respectively, representing 3.7% of the Company’s (together with Alphazyme Holdings) and MLSH 1’s respective LLC Units of Topco LLC, and an equal\nnumber of shares of the Company’s Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, were forfeited by MLSH 1, in each case for no consideration.\nThese were considered transactions between entities under common control. As a result, the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the these transactions have\nbeen adjusted to combine the previously separate entities for presentation purposes.\n12. Net (Loss) Income Per Class A Common Share Attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.\nBasic net (loss) income per Class A common share has been calculated by dividing net (loss) income for the period, adjusted for net (loss) income attributable to non-\ncontrolling interests, by the weighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss) income per Class A common share gives\neffect to potentially dilutive securities by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable. Diluted net (loss) income per Class A common share\nattributable to the Company is computed by adjusting the net (loss) income and the weighted average number of Class A common shares outstanding to give effect to\npotentially diluted securities. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc., diluted net loss per Class A common share\nattributable to the Company is the same as basic net loss per Class A common share attributable to the Company, since dilutive equity instruments are not assumed to have been\nissued if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company reported a net loss attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n122\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net (loss) income per common share attributable to the Company for the periods presented (in thousands,\nexcept per share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) income $ (138,375) $ 490,663 $ 469,250\nLess: loss (income) attributable to common non-controlling interests 19,346 (270,458) (287,213)\nNet (loss) income attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.—basic (119,029) 220,205 182,037\nNet (loss) income effect of dilutive securities:\nEffect of dilutive employee stock purchase plan, RSUs and options $ — 87 132\nEffect of the assumed conversion of Class B common stock — 205,984 220,187\nNet (loss) income attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.—diluted $ (119,029) $ 426,276 $ 402,356\nDenominator:\nWeighted average Class A common shares outstanding—basic 131,919 131,545 114,791\nWeighted average effect of dilutive securities:\nEffect of dilutive employee stock purchase plan, RSUs and options — 109 153\nEffect of the assumed conversion of Class B common stock — 123,669 142,859\nWeighted average Class A common shares outstanding—diluted 131,919 255,323 257,803\nNet (loss) income per Class A common share attributable to Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.:\nBasic $ (0.90) $ 1.67 $ 1.59\nDiluted $ (0.90) $ 1.67 $ 1.56\nShares of Class B common stock do not share in the earnings or losses of the Company, and are therefore not participating securities. As such, a separate presentation of basic\nand diluted net (loss) income per share for Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been presented.\nThe following table presents potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted net (loss) income per share for the periods presented because their effect\nwould have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRestricted stock units 3,181 74 —\nStock options 4,246 2,769 355\nShares estimated to be purchased under employee stock purchase plan — 13 12\nShares of Class B common stock 119,094 — —\nTotal 126,521 2,856 367\nShares underlying contingently issuable awards that have not met the necessary conditions as of the end of a reporting period are not included in the calculation of diluted net\n(loss) income per Class A common share attributable to the Company for that period. The Company had contingently issuable PSUs outstanding that did not meet the market\nand performance conditions as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and, therefore, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss) income per Class A common share\nattributable to the Company. The maximum number of potentially dilutive shares that could be issued upon vesting for such awards was insignificant as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022. These amounts were also excluded from the potentially dilutive securities in the table above. The Company had no contingently issuable PSUs outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n123\nTable of Contents\n13. Equity Incentive Plans\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors adopted the 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2020 Plan”). The 2020 Plan provides for an automatic increase in the\nnumber of shares reserved for issuance thereunder on January 1 of each of the first 10 calendar years during the term of the 2020 Plan, by the lesser of (i)4 % of the total number\nof shares of Class A common stock outstanding on each December 31 immediately prior to the date of increase or (ii) such number of shares of Class A common stock\ndetermined by our board of directors or compensation committee. Shares of Class A common stock subject to an award that expires or is cancelled, forfeited, exchanged, settled\nin cash or otherwise terminated without delivery of shares and shares withheld to pay the exercise price of, or to satisfy the withholding obligations with respect to, an award\nwill again be available for delivery pursuant to other awards under the 2020 Plan.\nAll awards granted under the 2020 Plan are intended to be treated as (i) stock options, including incentive stock options (“ISOs”), (ii) stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), (iii)\nrestricted share awards (“RSAs”), (iv) restricted stock units (“RSUs”), (v) performance awards, (vi) dividend equivalents, or (vii) other stock or cash awards as may be\ndetermined by the plan’s administrator from time to time. The term of each option award shall be no more than 10 years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock\noption shall not be less than 100% (or, in the case of an ISO granted to a ten percent stockholder, 110%) of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, only stock options, RSUs and PSUs have been issued.\nIn November 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) to assist employees in acquiring a stock ownership interest in the Company and\nto encourage them to remain in the employment of the Company. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase shares of Class A common stock at a discount through\npayroll deductions during specified six-month purchase periods. The price of shares purchased under the ESPP is equal to the lower of the grant date price less a 15% discount\nor a 15% discount to the market closing price on the date of purchase.\nCompensation expense recognized for the ESPP was insignificant for all periods presented.\nThe Company began issuing PSUs during 2022 to certain executive employees under the 2020 Plan. Certain PSUs vest only if the executive employee satisfies a service-based\nvesting condition and market condition. The executive employee must remain employed through the third anniversary of the grant date. The award is eligible to vest based on\nthe achievement of certain price targets of the Company’s stock price over a defined performance period. Certain other PSUs are subject to a performance condition being\nsatisfied. The award is eligible to vest upon achievement of certain revenue-based performance goals and are subject to continued service over a defined performance period.\nCompensation expense recognized for these PSUs were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. There wasn o compensation expense related to PSUs\nduring the year ended December 31, 2021.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes information related to stock options:\nWeighted Average\nWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Aggregate Intrinsic\nNumber of Stock Options Exercise Price per Life Value\n(in thousands) Stock Option (in years) (in thousands)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022 2,893 $ 26.45 8.9 $ —\nGranted 2,270 14.76\nCancelled (858) 25.11\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 4,305 $ 20.55 8.5 $ 19\nExercisable as of December 31, 2023 1,456 $ 24.76 7.7 $ —\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant or any other measurement date. The assumptions\nand estimates are as follows:\n• Expected term - The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method. Our\nhistorical share option exercise information is limited due to a lack of sufficient data points and does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected\nterm.\n124\nTable of Contents\n• Expected volatility - The expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of peer public companies within our industry that are considered to be\ncomparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards, since our stock trading history is limited.\n• Risk-free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with\nmaturities approximately equal to the stock-based awards’ expected term.\n• Expected dividend yield - The expected dividend yield is zero as we have no plans to make dividend payments.\nA summary of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock option grants for the years presented is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nExpected volatility 48.0 % 51.3 % 57.2 %\nRisk-free interest rate 3.6 % 2.8 % 1.0 %\nExpected term (in years) 6.5 6.1 6.1\nExpected dividend yield — % — % — %\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $11.5 million, $8.1 million and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The total fair value of stock options vested was $11.9 million, $7.7 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation related to stock options was $26.3 million, which is expected be recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of approximately 2.7 years.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company has granted restricted stock unit awards to employees and non-employee directors and contractors. The following table summarizes information related to RSUs:\nRestricted Stock Units Weighted Average Fair Value\n(in thousands) per RSU at Grant Date\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 1,331 $ 21.04\nGranted 3,507 13.66\nVested (278) 23.66\nForfeited (616) 20.30\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 3,944 $ 15.35\nStock-based compensation expense related to RSUs was $20.2 million, $8.2 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The\ntotal fair value of RSUs vested was $5.0 million, $1.0 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total unrecognized equity-based compensation related to RSUs was $43.7 million, which is expected be recognized over a weighted-average\nperiod of approximately 2.0 years.\nUnit-Based Compensation\nPrior to the IPO, the Company’s parent, MLSH 1, granted unit-based awards (“MLSH 1 Incentive Units”) to certain executives of the Company in the form of non-vested units.\nMLSH 1 Incentive Units\nPrior to the Organizational Transactions, Topco LLC entered into agreements with certain executives and board members whereby those employees and board members were\ngranted incentive units in MLSH 1, a related party. All MLSH 1 Incentive Unit awards were subject to a market condition which is subject to the achievement of a certain\ninvestment return threshold that increased on a compounding basis annually and a service condition subject to their continued employment. Certain MLSH 1 Incentive Unit\nawards contained a performance condition tied to the achievement of certain cash distribution multiples. All vested MLSH 1 Incentive Unit awards are subject to repurchase for\nfair value at MLSH 1’s option upon a voluntary or involuntary separation event that is not deemed to be for cause.\n125\nTable of Contents\nThe MLSH 1 Incentive Unit awards that include market and service conditions provide for cliff-vesting generally overf our or five years. The MLSH 1 Incentive Unit awards\nthat include market and performance conditions provide for full vesting upon meeting the performance condition. The fair value of MLSH 1 Incentive Unit awards was\nmeasured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the requisite service period for the awards.\nIn connection with the divestiture of its Protein Detection business, the Company recognized incremental unit-based compensation expense of $2.4 million related to an\namended agreement with an executive of Vector (see Note 2). This unit-based compensation expense was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nUnit-based compensation expense related to MLSH 1 Incentive Unit awards was approximately $0.2 million, $0.7 million and $3.9 million for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nMLSH 1 Incentive Unit award activity during year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nNumber of Unvested MLSH 1\nIncentive Units Weighted Average Grant Date\n(in thousands) Fair Value Per Unit\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 77 $ 24.34\nForfeited (12) 20.08\nVested (33) 22.24\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 32 $ 28.15\nAs of December 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested MLSH 1 Incentive Units subject to service condition is $0.1 million which is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted average period of 1.0 year.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes the total equity-based compensation expense included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (in\nthousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nCost of sales $ 7,324 $ 4,192 $ 1,915\nSelling, general and administrative 24,650 13,349 8,263\nResearch and development 2,715 1,129 280\nRestructuring (101) — —\nTotal equity-based compensation $ 34,588 $ 18,670 $ 10,458\n14.

Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to\nestimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective evidence evaluated during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 was our current year and projected future pre-tax losses. Due to our recent history of current year and projected near-term pre-tax losses, we\ndetermined that the negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence and so it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized, and therefore the\nCompany recorded a full valuation allowance on its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. The objective negative evidence is difficult to overcome and limits the ability to\nconsider other subjective evidence, such as projections of future growth. It is possible in the foreseeable future that there may be sufficient positive evidence, and that the\nobjective negative evidence related to pre-tax losses will no longer be present, in which event the Company could release a portion or all of the valuation allowance. Release of\nany amount of valuation allowance would result in a benefit to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded, which could have a material impact on net earnings.\nAlphazyme was treated as a regarded corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes at the time of acquisition. The Company recorded the initial contribution of\nAlphazyme to Topco LLC through its deferred tax asset related to the investment in Topco LLC, which was offset by a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. The\nCompany also recorded a deferred tax liability for the difference between book basis and tax basis in the net assets of Alphazyme through purchase accounting. However, for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, Alphazyme became a disregarded entity for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, which became effective immediately following the\nacquisition and prior to the contribution to Topco LLC. The change in Alphazyme’s tax status resulted in an income tax benefit of $8.8 million from the reversal of the\nCompany’s deferred tax liability related to its ownership of Alphazyme, as well as an income tax expense of $17.1 million from the impact of the reversal to the Company’s\ndeferred tax asset for its investment in Topco LLC.\nNet operating loss (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nAmount Expiration Years\nNet operating losses, federal $ 36.3 Does not expire\nNet operating losses, state 4.7 Varies by state\nCapital loss carryforward 3.3 2026\nTax credits, federal 0.3 2043\nTax credits, state 0.3 CA - Do not expire\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $5.2 million and $6.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.\nThe Company expects our unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by $2.6 million in the next twelve months due to statute expiration. The Company recognizes interest related\nto uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense, including $0.3 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance, beginning of year $ 6,257 $ 241 $ 220\nGross increases based on tax positions related to current year 99 130 232\nGross increases based on tax positions related to prior years — 6,775 —\nGross decreases based on tax positions related to prior years (1,158) (889) (211)\nBalance, end of year $ 5,198 $ 6,257 $ 241\n128\nTable of Contents\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and is not under audit by taxing authorities in any of these jurisdictions. With exceptions\nfor certain states, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2020.\nPayable to Related Parties Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nWe are a party to a TRA with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. The TRA provides for the payment by us to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2, collectively, of 85% of the amount of certain tax\nbenefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of the Organizational Transactions, IPO and any subsequent purchases or\nexchanges of LLC Units of Topco LLC. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of any cash tax savings that it realizes.\nWe recognize the amount of TRA payments expected to be paid within the next 12 months and classify this amount as current. This determination is based on our estimate of\ntaxable income for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the current liability under the TRA was $7.1 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has derecognized the remaining $665.3 million non-current liability under the TRA after concluding it was not probable that the\nCompany will be able to realize the remaining tax benefits based on estimates of future taxable income. The estimation of liability under the TRA is by its nature imprecise and\nsubject to significant assumptions regarding the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income in the future. If the Company concludes in a future period that the tax\nbenefits are more likely than not to be realized and releases its valuation allowance, the corresponding TRA liability amounts may be considered probable at that time and\nrecorded on the consolidated balance sheet and within earnings.\nWe made payments of $42.6 million to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the TRA during the year ended December 31, 2023, of which $0.4 million is related to interest. We\nmade payments of $35.3 million to MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 pursuant to the TRA during the year ended December 31, 2022, of which $1.1 million was related to interest. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, our liabilities under the TRA were $7.1 million and $718.2 million, respectively.\nTax Distributions to Topco LLC’s Owners\nTopco LLC is subject to an operating agreement put in place at the date of the Organizational Transactions (“LLC Operating Agreement”). The LLC Operating Agreement has\nnumerous provisions related to allocations of income and loss, as well as timing and amounts of distributions to its owners. This agreement also includes a provision requiring\ncash distributions enabling its owners to pay their taxes on income passing through from Topco LLC. These tax distributions are computed based on an assumed income tax\nrate equal to the sum of (i) the maximum combined marginal federal and state income tax rate applicable to an individual and (ii) the net investment income tax. The assumed\nincome tax rate ranges from 46.7% to 54.1% in certain cases where the qualified business income deduction is unavailable.\nIn addition, under the tax rules, Topco LLC is required to allocate taxable income disproportionately to its unit holders. Because tax distributions are determined based on the\nholder of LLC Units who is allocated the largest amount of taxable income on a per unit basis, but are made pro rata based on ownership, Topco LLC is required to make tax\ndistributions that, in the aggregate, will likely exceed the amount of taxes Topco LLC would have otherwise paid if it were taxed on its taxable income at the assumed income\ntax rate. Topco LLC is subject to entity level taxation in certain states and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to entity level U.S. and foreign income taxes. As a result, the\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations include income tax expense related to those states and to U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where Topco LLC or any of our\nsubsidiaries are subject to income tax.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, Topco LLC paid tax distributions of $20.3 million to its owners, including $10.7 million to us. During the year ended December 31,\n2022, Topco LLC paid tax distributions of $310.0 million to its owners, including $159.8 million to us. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Topco LLC paid tax\ndistributions of $283.2 million to its owners, including $129.7 million to us.\nAs of December 31, 2023, no amounts for tax distributions have been accrued as such payments were made during the period.\n15. Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) plan (the “Maravai LifeSciences 401(k) Plan”) pursuant to which eligible employees can elect to contribute to the 401(k) Plan, subject to\ncertain limitations, on a pretax basis. The Company provides for a cash match of up to 50% of employee contributions up to the first 6% of salary.\nTotal contributions by the Company to the Maravai LifeSciences 401(k) Plan was approximately $2.1 million, $1.6 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n129\nTable of Contents\n16. Related Party Transactions\nMLSH 1’s majority owner is GTCR, LLC (“GTCR”). The Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and General Counsel are executives\nof MLSH 1 and MLSH 2.\nRegistration Rights Agreement with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2\nIn connection with the IPO, Company entered into a registration rights agreement with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 are entitled to request that the Company\nregister their shares of capital stock on a long-form or short-form registration statement on one or more occasions in the future, which registrations may be “shelf registrations.”\nMLSH 1 and MLSH 2 are also entitled to participate in certain of our registered offerings, subject to the restrictions in the registration rights agreement. During 2021, the\nCompany registered shares of Class A shares held by MLSH 1 which were subsequently sold in an offering as selling shareholders as well as facilitated secondary offering\ntransactions related to the exchanges (see Note 11).\nExchange Agreement with MLSH 1\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company entered into an exchange agreement with MLSH 1, whereby MLSH 1 may surrender their LLC Units to Topco LLC or, at our\nelection, exchange its LLC Units for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, or, at our election, for cash from a substantially concurrent public offering or\nprivate sale. MLSH 1 is also required to deliver to us an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock to effectuate an exchange. MLSH 1 executed two exchanges\nunder this agreement during 2021 (see Note 11).\nPayable to Related Parties Pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement\nConcurrent with the completion of the IPO, the Company entered into a TRA with MLSH 1 and MLSH 2. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the\nCompany made TRA payments to both MLSH 1 and MLSH 2 (see Note 14).\nCash Contribution, Exchange and Forfeiture Agreement with MLSH 1\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a Cash Contribution, Exchange and Forfeiture Agreement with MLSH 1 (see Note 11).\nTopco LLC Operating Agreement\nMLSH 1 is party to the Topco LLC operating agreement put in place at the date of the Organizational Transactions. This agreement includes a provision requiring cash\ndistributions enabling its owners to pay their taxes on income passing through from Topco LLC. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company\nmade distributions of $9.6 million, $150.2 million and $153.5 million for tax liabilities to MLSH 1 under this agreement, respectively.\nContract Development and Manufacturing Agreement with Curia Global\nGTCR has significant influence over Curia Global (“Curia”). During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid insignificant amounts to Curia for\ncontract manufacturing and development services. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $7.4 million to Curia. Such amounts were included in research\nand development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nMaravai LifeSciences Foundation\nIn December 2021, the Company established a new charitable foundation to promote causes tied to Maravai’s mission. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the\nCompany contributed $2.0 million to the Foundation. The Company does not control the Foundation’s activities, and accordingly, does not consolidate the Foundation.\n17. Segments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision\nmaker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. When determining the reportable segments, the Company aggregated\noperating segments based on their similar economic and operating characteristics. Segment results are presented in the same manner as we present our operations internally to\nmake operating decisions and assess performance. The accounting policies for the segments are the\n130\nTable of Contents\nsame as those described in Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 1). The Company’s financial performance is reported in three segments. A description of each segment\nfollows:\n• Nucleic Acid Production: focuses on the manufacturing and sale of highly modified nucleic acids products to support the needs of customers’ research, therapeutic and\nvaccine programs. This segment also provides research products for labeling and detecting proteins in cells and tissue samples.\n• Biologics Safety Testing: focuses on the manufacturing and sale of host cell protein, bioprocess impurity detection, viral clearance prediction kits and associated products.\nThis segment also provides services for custom antibody development, assay development, antibody affinity extraction and mass spectrometry that are utilized by our\ncustomers in their biologic drug manufacturing spectrum.\n• Protein Detection: focused on manufacturing and selling labeling and visual detection reagents to scientific research customers for their tissue-based protein detection and\ncharacterization needs. The Company completed the divestiture of its Protein Detection business in September 2021 (see Note 2).\nThe Company has determined that adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is the profit or loss measure that the CODM uses\nto make resource allocation decisions and evaluate segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA assists management in comparing the segment performance on a consistent basis\nfor purposes of business decision-making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the core operations and, therefore, are not\nincluded in measuring segment performance. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, certain non-\ncash items and other adjustments that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance from period to period. Corporate costs, net of eliminations, are\nmanaged on a standalone basis and not allocated to segments.\n131\nTable of Contents\nThe following schedule includes revenue and adjusted EBITDA for each of the Company’s reportable operating segments (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenue:\nNucleic Acid Production $ 224,769 $ 813,076 $ 712,520\nBiologics Safety Testing 64,179 69,932 68,417\nProtein Detection — — 18,959\nTotal reportable segments’ revenue 288,948 883,008 799,896\nIntersegment eliminations (3) (7) (656)\nTotal $ 288,945 $ 883,001 $ 799,240\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\nNucleic Acid Production $ 82,658 $ 638,337 $ 565,254\nBiologics Safety Testing 46,908 54,841 54,440\nProtein Detection — — 6,391\nTotal reportable segments’ adjusted EBITDA 129,566 693,178 626,085\nReconciliation of total reportable segments’ adjusted EBITDA to income before income taxes\nAmortization (27,356) (24,269) (18,339)\nDepreciation (12,898) (7,566) (6,413)\nInterest expense (45,892) (20,414) (30,260)\nInterest income 27,727 2,338 —\nCorporate costs, net of eliminations (64,257) (55,378) (43,265)\nOther adjustments:\nAcquisition contingent consideration 3,286 7,800 —\nAcquisition integration costs (12,695) (13,362) (44)\nEquity-based compensation (34,588) (18,670) (10,458)\nGain on sale of business — — 11,249\nMerger and acquisition related expenses (4,392) (2,416) (1,508)\nFinancing costs — (1,078) (2,383)\nAcquisition related tax adjustment (1,293) (349) —\nTax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment 668,886 (4,102) 6,101\nChief Executive Officer transition costs (28) (2,426) —\nRestructuring costs (1) (6,567) — —\nOther (1,763) (1,814) —\nIncome before income taxes 617,736 551,472 530,765\nIncome tax expense (756,111) (60,809) (61,515)\nNet (loss) income $ (138,375) $ 490,663 $ 469,250\n___________________\n(1) Equity-based compensation benefit of $0.1 million related to forfeited equity awards in connection with the restructuring is included on the equity-based compensation line item.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, intersegment revenue was immaterial between the Nucleic Acid Production and Biologics Safety Testing segments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, intersegment revenue was $0.7 million between the Nucleic Acid Production and Protein Detection segments. The intersegment\nsales and the related gross margin on inventory recorded at the end of the period are eliminated for consolidation purposes. Internal selling prices for intersegment sales are\nconsistent with the segment’s normal retail price offered to external parties. There was no commission expense recognized for intersegment sales for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n132\nTable of Contents\nThe Company does not allocate assets to its reportable segments as they are not included in the review performed by the CODM for purposes of assessing segment performance\nand allocating resources.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the\nreports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to\ndo, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a\nreasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on its assessment,\nmanagement concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered\npublic accounting firm, has issued an auditors’ report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, which is included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n133\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Maravai\nLifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO\ncriteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;\nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Mateo, California\nFebruary 29, 2024\n134\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

(the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) had one class of securities, our\nClass A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nThe following summary of terms of our Class A common stock is based upon our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\n(our “certificate” or “certificate of incorporation”) and our amended and restated by-laws (our “bylaws”) currently in effect under Delaware\nlaw. This summary is not complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the certificate and the bylaws, which are filed\nas Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.2 is a part. We encourage you to read these documents and\nthe applicable portion of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the “DGCL”), carefully.\nUnder our certificate, we have the authority to issue 500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A\ncommon stock”), 300,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B common stock”), and 50,000,000 shares\nof preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (“preferred stock”).\nClass A Common Stock\nAs of February 21, 2024, there were 132,305,845 shares of Class A common stock outstanding.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote\nof shareholders. The holders of our Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nHolders of shares of our Class A common stock vote together with holders of our Class B common stock as a single class on all matters\npresented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except for certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation described below or as\notherwise required by applicable law or the certificate.\nDividend Rights\nHolders of shares of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by our Board out of funds legally\navailable therefor, subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and to any restrictions on the payment of\ndividends imposed by the terms of any outstanding preferred stock.\nKE 75513999.2\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon our dissolution or liquidation or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, after payment in full of all amounts required to be\npaid to creditors and to the holders of preferred stock having liquidation preferences, if any, the holders of shares of our Class A common stock\nwill be entitled to receive pro rata our remaining assets available for distribution.\nPreemptive, Conversion or Redemption Rights\nHolders of shares of our Class A common stock do not have preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There are no\nredemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A common stock.\nClass B Common Stock\nAs of February 21, 2024, there were 119,094,026 shares of Class B common stock outstanding. Maravai Life Sciences Holdings, LLC\nowns 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of shares of our Class B common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote\nof shareholders. The holders of our Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors.\nHolders of shares of our Class B common stock vote together with holders of our Class A common stock as a single class on all matters\npresented to our shareholders for their vote or approval, except for certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation described below or as\notherwise required by applicable law or the certificate.\nDividend or Liquidation Rights\nHolders of our Class B common stock do not have any right to receive dividends or to receive a distribution upon dissolution or\nliquidation or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nPreemptive, Conversion or Redemption Rights\nHolders of shares of our Class B common stock do not have preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights. There are no\nredemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class B common stock.\nAmendments\nAny amendment of our certificate of incorporation that gives holders of our Class B common stock (1) any rights to receive dividends\nor any other kind of distribution, (2) any right to convert into or be exchanged for Class A common stock or (3) any other economic rights will\n2\nrequire, in addition to shareholder approval, the affirmative vote of holders of our Class A common stock voting separately as a class.\nPreferred Stock\nAs of February 21, 2024, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.\nOur Board is authorized to direct us to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without shareholder approval. Our Board\nhas the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights,\nredemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock.\nThe purpose of authorizing our Board to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated\nwith a shareholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible\nacquisitions, future financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or\ncould discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock\nmay adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock by restricting dividends on the Class A common stock, diluting the voting\npower of the Class A common stock or subordinating the liquidation rights of the Class A common stock. As a result of these or other factors,\nthe issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nForum Selection\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any state court action for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought\non our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or\nour shareholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. or any director or officer thereof arising\npursuant to any provision of the DGCL or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, our\ncertificate of incorporation or our bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim against Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. or any director\nor officer thereof that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the forum selection provision that\nidentifies the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation, including any “derivative action,” does\nnot apply to suits to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts\nhave exclusive jurisdiction. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of\naction arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is\ndeemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described\n3\nabove. Although we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law or the Securities\nAct, as applicable, for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or\nour directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find any of the forum selection provisions contained in our amended and restated\ncertificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with having to litigate such action in\nother jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects and\nresult in a diversion of the time and resources of our employees, management and board of directors.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nOur certificate, bylaws and the DGCL contain provisions, which are summarized in the following paragraphs, that are intended to\nenhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our Board. These provisions are intended to avoid costly takeover\nbattles, reduce our vulnerability to a hostile change of control and enhance the ability of our Board to maximize shareholder value in\nconnection with any unsolicited offer to acquire us. However, these provisions may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or\nprevent a merger or acquisition of us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or other takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in\nits best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the prevailing market price for the shares of Class A common\nstock held by shareholders.\nThese provisions include:\nClassified Board. Our certificate provides that our Board is divided into three classes of directors, with the classes as nearly equal in\nnumber as possible, and with the directors serving three-year terms. As a result, approximately one-third of our Board is elected each year. The\nclassification of the directors has the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders to change the composition of our Board. Our certificate\nalso provides that, subject to any rights of holders of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of\ndirectors is fixed exclusively pursuant to resolutions adopted by our Board. Our Board currently has 11 members.\nShareholder Action by Written Consent. Our certificate precludes shareholder action by written consent at any time when GTCR, LLC\n(“GTCR”) controls, in the aggregate, less than 35% in voting power of our outstanding common stock.\nSpecial Meetings of Shareholders. Our certificate and bylaws provide that, except as required by law, special meetings of our\nshareholders may be called at any time only by or at the direction of our Board or the chairman of our Board; provided, however, at any time\nwhen GTCR controls, in the aggregate, at least 35% in voting power of our outstanding common stock, special meetings of our shareholders\nshall also be called by our Board or the chairman of our Board at the request of GTCR. Our bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a\nspecial meeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting. These provisions may have the\n4\neffect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of us.\nAdvance Notice Procedures. Our bylaws establish advance notice procedures for shareholder proposals and nomination of candidates\nfor election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our Board or a committee of our Board, and provided, however,\nthat at any time when GTCR controls, in the aggregate, at least 10% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, such advance\nnotice procedure does not apply to GTCR. Shareholders at an annual meeting are only be able to consider proposals or nominations specified in\nthe notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our Board or by a shareholder who was a shareholder of record on\nthe record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given our Secretary timely written notice, in proper form, of\nthe shareholder’s intention to bring that business before the meeting. Although the bylaws do not give our Board the power to approve or\ndisapprove shareholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting, the\nbylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may\ndiscourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to\nobtain control of us. These provisions do not apply to nominations by GTCR pursuant to the Director Nomination Agreement.\nRemoval of Directors; Vacancies. Our certificate provides that a director nominated by GTCR may be removed with or without cause\nby GTCR; provided, however, that at any time when GTCR controls less than 40% in voting power of our outstanding common stock, all\ndirectors, including those nominated by GTCR, may only be removed for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3%\nin voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. In\naddition, our certificate also provides that, subject to the rights granted to one or more series of preferred stock then outstanding, any newly\ncreated directorship on our Board that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancies on our Board will be filled only by\nthe affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by the\nshareholders).\nSupermajority Approval Requirements. Our certificate and bylaws provide that our Board is expressly authorized to make, alter,\namend, change, add to, rescind or repeal, in whole or in part, our bylaws without a shareholder vote in any matter not inconsistent with the laws\nof the State of Delaware and our certificate. For as long as GTCR controls, in the aggregate, at least 50% in voting power of our outstanding\ncommon stock, any amendment, alteration, rescission or repeal of our bylaws by our shareholders requires the affirmative vote of a majority in\nvoting power of the outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote on such amendment, alteration, change, addition, rescission or repeal. At\nany time when GTCR controls, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting power of our outstanding common stock, any amendment, alteration,\nrescission or repeal of our bylaws by our shareholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the\nthen-outstanding shares of stock of the company entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\n5\nThe DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon, voting together\nas a single class, is required to amend a corporation’s certificate of incorporation, unless the certificate requires a greater percentage.\nOur certificate provides that the following provisions in our certificate may be amended, altered, repealed or rescinded only by the\naffirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% (as opposed to a majority threshold) in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of\nstock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class at any time when GTCR controls, in the aggregate, less than 50% in voting\npower of our outstanding common stock (except as otherwise noted below):\n• the provision requiring a 66 2/3% supermajority vote for shareholders to amend our bylaws;\n• the provisions providing for a classified board of directors (the election and term of our directors);\n• the provisions regarding resignation and removal of directors;\n• the provisions regarding entering into business combinations with interested shareholders;\n• the provisions regarding shareholder action by written consent;\n• the provisions regarding calling special meetings of shareholders;\n• the provisions regarding filling vacancies on our Board and newly created directorships;\n• the provision establishing the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation;\n• the provision establishing the federal district courts of the United States as the exclusive forum for litigation arising under the\nSecurities Act;\n• the provisions eliminating monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty by a director (which requires a super majority vote,\nregardless of GTCR's then-current ownership); and\n• the amendment provision requiring that the above provisions be amended only with a 66 2/3% supermajority vote.\nThe combination of the classification of our Board, the lack of cumulative voting and the supermajority voting requirements will make\nit more difficult for our existing shareholders to replace our Board as well as for another party to obtain control of us by replacing our Board.\nBecause our Board has the power to retain and discharge our officers, these provisions could also\n6\nmake it more difficult for existing shareholders or another party to effect a change in management.\nAuthorized but Unissued Shares. Our authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock will be available for future\nissuance without shareholder approval, subject to stock exchange rules. These additional shares of capital stock may be utilized for a variety of\ncorporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. One of the\neffects of the existence of authorized but unissued common stock or preferred stock may be to enable our Board to issue shares of capital stock\nto persons friendly to current management, which issuance could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the\ncompany by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and thereby protect the continuity of our management and possibly\ndeprive our shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares of common stock at prices higher than prevailing market prices.\nBusiness Combinations. We are not subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly\nheld Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested shareholder” for a three-year period following the\ntime that the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business\ncombination” includes, among other things, a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested\nshareholder. An “interested shareholder” is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or did own within three years prior to\nthe determination of interested shareholder status, 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock.\nUnder Section 203, a business combination between a corporation and an interested shareholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of\nthe following conditions: (1) before the shareholder became an interested shareholder, the Board approved either the business combination or\nthe transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder; (2) upon consummation of the transaction which resulted\nin the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation\noutstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding, shares owned by\npersons who are directors and also officers, and employee stock plans, in some instances; or (3) at or after the time the shareholder became an\ninterested shareholder, the business combination was approved by the Board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the shareholders\nby the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested shareholder.\nA Delaware corporation may “opt out” of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an\nexpress provision in its certificate of incorporation or bylaws resulting from a shareholders’ amendment approved by at least a majority of the\noutstanding voting shares.\nWe opted out of Section 203; however, our certificate contains similar provisions providing that we may not engage in certain “business\ncombinations” with any “interested\n7\nshareholder” for a three-year period following the time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless:\n• prior to such time, our Board approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the shareholder becoming\nan interested shareholder;\n• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder\nowned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\n• at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by our Board and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66\n2/3% of our outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested shareholder.\nUnder certain circumstances, this provision will make it more difficult for a person who would be an “interested shareholder” to effect\nvarious business combinations with us for a three-year period. This provision may encourage companies interested in acquiring us to negotiate\nin advance with our Board because the shareholder approval requirement would be avoided if our Board approves either the business\ncombination or the transaction which results in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder. These provisions also may have the effect\nof preventing changes in our Board and may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions which shareholders may otherwise deem to be in\ntheir best interests.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that GTCR, and any of its direct or indirect transferees and any group as to which such persons\nare a party, do not constitute “interested shareholders” for purposes of this provision.\nLimitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nThe DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for\nmonetary damages for breaches of directors’ fiduciary duties, subject to certain exceptions. Our certificate includes a provision that eliminates\nthe personal liability of directors for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from\nliability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL. The effect of these provisions will be to eliminate the rights of us and our\nshareholders, through shareholders’ derivative suits on our behalf, to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of fiduciary duty as\na director, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior. However, exculpation does not apply to any director if the director has\nacted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends or redemptions or derived an improper benefit from\nhis or her actions as a director.\nOur bylaws provide that we must indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the\nDGCL. We also are expressly authorized to carry directors’ and officers’ liability insurance providing indemnification for our directors,\nofficers and certain employees for some liabilities. We believe that these indemnification and\n8\nadvancement provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and officers.\nThe limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement provisions included in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may\ndiscourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breaches of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the\neffect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might\notherwise benefit us and our shareholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement\nand damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nThere is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which\nindemnification is sought.\nCorporate Opportunity Doctrine\nDelaware law permits corporations to adopt provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy in certain opportunities that are presented\nto the corporation or its officers, directors or shareholders. Our certificate, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by Delaware\nlaw, renounces any interest or expectancy that we have in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business\nopportunities that are from time to time presented to certain of our officers, directors or shareholders or their respective affiliates, other than\nthose officers, directors, shareholders or affiliates who are our or our subsidiaries’ employees. Our certificate provides that, to the fullest extent\npermitted by law, none of GTCR or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our\nofficers in both his or her director and officer capacities) or its, his or her affiliates have any duty to refrain from (1) engaging in a corporate\nopportunity in the same or similar lines of business in which we or our affiliates now engage or propose to engage or (2) otherwise competing\nwith us or our affiliates. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in the event that GTCR or any non-employee director acquires\nknowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for itself, himself or herself or its, his\nor her affiliates or for us or our affiliates, such person has no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us or any\nof our affiliates and they may take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to another person or entity. Our certificate does not renounce\nour interest in any business opportunity that is expressly offered to a non-employee director solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer\nof Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no business opportunity will be deemed to be a potential\ncorporate opportunity for us unless we would be permitted to undertake the opportunity under our certificate, we have sufficient financial\nresources to undertake the opportunity and the opportunity would be in line with our business.\nDissenters’ Rights of Appraisal and Payment\nUnder the DGCL, with certain exceptions, our shareholders have appraisal rights in connection with a merger or consolidation of\nMaravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. Pursuant to the DGCL, shareholders who properly request and perfect appraisal rights in connection with\n9\nsuch merger or consolidation have the right to receive payment of the fair value of their shares of capital stock as determined by the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery.\nShareholders’ Derivative Actions\nUnder the DGCL, any of our shareholders may bring an action in our name to procure a judgment in our favor, also known as a\nderivative action, provided that the shareholder bringing the action is a holder of our shares of capital stock at the time of the transaction to\nwhich the action relates or such shareholder’s stock thereafter devolved by operation of law.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our Class A common stock is Equiniti Trust Company, LLC. Its address is 48 Wall Street, Floor 23,\nNew York, 10005.\nListing\nOur Class A common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “MRVI.”\n10\nExhibit 10.15\nLEASE AGREEMENT\nBETWEEN\n10240 FLANDERS INVESTORS LLC,\na Delaware limited liability company\n(LANDLORD)\nAND\nTRILINK BIOTECHNOLOGIES, LLC,\na Delaware limited liability company\n(TENANT)\nAugust 6, 2021\n10240-10247 FLANDERS COURT\nSAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nThe table of contents is empty.

Tenant shall exercise the Option by giving written notice to Landlord of its election to do so not earlier than twelve (12) months and not later than\nnine (9) months prior to the Expiration Date. The giving of such notice of extension by Tenant shall automatically extend the Term of this Lease for the Option Term, and no\ninstrument of renewal or extension need be executed.

The Option shall be exercisable by Tenant only on the express condition that (i) at the time\nof the exercise, and at all times between the time of such exercise and the commencement of the Option Term, Tenant shall not be in Default under any of the provisions of this\nLease, and (ii) Tenant shall not have been ten (10) or more days late in the payment of Monthly Basic Rent more than once during any twelve (12) consecutive month period\nduring the Term.\n1.1.2. The Option Term shall be on all the terms and conditions of this Lease, except that: (i) Tenant shall have no further right or option to extend the\nTerm as provided by this Section 3.2; (ii) the Basic Rent for the Option Term shall be equal to the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises, determined pursuant to Subsection\n3.2.3 below; and (iii) Tenant shall not be entitled to any abatement of Basic Rent or any tenant\n- 4 -\nimprovement allowance during the Option Term unless otherwise determined to be included in the Fair Market Rental Value in accordance withS ection 3.2.3 below.

For the purposes hereof, “Fair Market Rental Value” of the Premises shall mean the prevailing annual market rental value (which rental value\ndetermination may include increases in Rent during the Option Term) for Class “A” office, manufacturing, and laboratory/research and development space of comparable size,\nquality and location in comparable first-class office and laboratory/research and development buildings located in the Sorrento Mesa submarket of San Diego, California, as of\nthe date of commencement of the Option Term (“Comparable Transactions”), taking into consideration the amenities offered in or near the Project and the amount, availability\nand cost of parking; provided, however, that in calculating the Fair Market Rental Value, no consideration shall be given to (1) the fact that Landlord is or is not required to pay\na real estate brokerage commission in connection with Tenant’s exercise of its right to lease the Premises during the Option Term or the fact that landlords are or are not paying\nreal estate brokerage commissions in connection with such comparable space, and (2) any period of rental abatement, if any, granted to tenants in comparable transactions in\nconnection with the design, permitting and construction of tenant improvements in such comparable spaces. The Fair Market Rental Value shall additionally include a\ndetermination as to whether, and if so to what extent, Tenant must provide Landlord with financial security, such as a letter of credit or security deposit, for Tenant’s Rent\nobligations in connection with Tenant’s lease of the Premises during the Option Term. Such determination shall be made by reviewing the extent of financial security then\ngenerally being imposed in Comparable Transactions from tenants of comparable financial condition and credit history to the then existing financial condition and credit history\nof Tenant (with appropriate adjustments to account for differences in the then-existing financial condition of Tenant and such other tenants).\n1.1.4. Promptly after receiving Tenant’s notice of its election to exercise the Option to extend the Term of this Lease, Landlord shall provide Tenant with\nLandlord’s good faith estimate of the Fair Market Rental Value of the Premises for the Option Term (“Landlord’s Fair Market Rental Value Notice”). In the event that Tenant\nobjects to Landlord’s determination of the Fair Market Rental Value within fifteen (15) business days following Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s Fair Market Rental Value Notice,\nLandlord and Tenant shall attempt to agree upon the Fair Market Rental Value using their best good faith efforts. If Landlord and Tenant fail to reach agreement within ten (10)\nbusiness days following Tenant’s objection to the Fair Market Rental Value (“Outside Agreement Date”), then each party shall make a separate determination of the Fair Market\nRental Value within ten (10) business days after the Outside Agreement Date, and such determinations shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Subsection 3.2.4(A)\nthrough Subsection 3.2.4(G) below.\n(A) Landlord and Tenant shall each appoint one arbitrator who shall be a real estate broker or attorney who shall have been active over the five\n(5) year period ending on the date of such appointment in the leasing of office and laboratory/research and development properties in the Sorrento Mesa submarket of San\nDiego, California. The determination of the arbitrators shall be limited solely to the issue of whether Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Rental Value is the closest to\nthe actual Fair Market Rental Value, as determined by the arbitrators, taking into account the requirements of Subsection 3.2.3. Each such arbitrator shall be appointed within\nfifteen (15) days after the applicable Outside Agreement Date.\n(B) The two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall within ten (10) days of the date of the appointment of the last appointed arbitrator agree upon and\nappoint a third arbitrator who shall be qualified under the same criteria set forth hereinabove for qualification of the initial two (2) arbitrators.\n(C) The three (3) arbitrators shall within thirty (30) days of the appointment of the third arbitrator reach a decision as to whether the parties\nshall use Landlord’s or Tenant’s submitted Fair Market Rental Value and shall notify Landlord and Tenant thereof.\n(D) The decision of the majority of the three (3) arbitrators shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.\n(E) If either Landlord or Tenant fails to appoint an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the applicable Outside Agreement Date, then the\narbitrator appointed by one of them shall reach a decision, notify Landlord and Tenant thereof and such arbitrator’s decision shall be binding upon Landlord and Tenant.\n(F) If the two (2) arbitrators fail to agree upon and appoint a third arbitrator, or if both parties fail to appoint an arbitrator, then the appointment\nof the third arbitrator or any arbitrator shall be dismissed and the matter to be decided shall be forthwith submitted to arbitration under the provisions of the American\nArbitration Association, but subject to the instruction set forth in this Subsection 3.2.4.\n- 5 -\n(G) The cost of the arbitration shall be paid by Landlord and Tenant equally.\nArticle 4\nDELIVERY\nLandlord will endeavor to tender possession of the applicable Premises to Tenant with the applicable Tenant Improvements Substantially Complete on or before the\napplicable Estimated Commencement Date; provided, that if the date on which Landlord actually tenders possession of the Premises to Tenant in such condition does not occur\non or before the Estimated Commencement Date, this Lease shall not be void or voidable, the Term of this Lease shall not be extended, and Landlord shall not be liable to\nTenant for any loss or damage resulting therefrom; provided further that Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to tender to Tenant delivery of possession of the\napplicable Premises in such condition as soon as reasonably possible after the applicable Estimated Commencement Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Term and\nTenant’s obligation to pay Base Rent, Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes for the applicable Premises shall not begin until the actual Commencement Date for such\nPremises.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord is unable to deliver possession of Premises A to Tenant with the Landlord Work and Tenant Improvements therein\nSubstantially Complete on or before the date which is sixty (60) days after the Estimated Commencement Date for Premises A (“First Outside Delivery Date”), which First\nOutside Delivery Date shall be extended on a day-for-day basis for any delay caused by an event of Force Majeure (as defined in Section 36.8 below), a Tenant Delay (as that\nterm is defined in the Work Letter Agreement) or similar matters beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, Tenant shall be entitled to receive an abatement of Basic Rent for\nPremises A on a day-for-day basis for each day between the First Outside Delivery Date and the actual date on which possession of Premises A is delivered to Tenant with the\nLandlord Work and Tenant Improvements therein Substantially Complete (“Actual Delivery Date for Premises A”), to be applied as a credit toward the Basic Rent next due and\npayable under this Lease (for example, if the Estimated Commencement Date for Premises A is February 1, 2022, and the Actual Delivery Date for Premises A is February 5,\n2022, then Tenant shall receive a credit toward Basic Rent in an amount equal to four (4) days of Basic Rent for Premises A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord is\nunable to deliver possession of Premises A to Tenant with the Landlord Work and Tenant Improvements therein Substantially Complete on or before the date which is one\nhundred eighty (180) days after the Estimated Commencement Date for Premises A (“Second Outside Delivery Date”), which Second Outside Delivery Date shall be extended\non a day-for-day basis for any delay caused by an event of Force Majeure, a Tenant Delay or similar matters beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, then Tenant shall have\nthe right to terminate this Lease by delivering Notice thereof to Landlord no later than five (5) business days after the Second Outside Delivery Date, which termination shall be\neffective as of the date of such Notice. Tenant’s failure to deliver a Notice of termination within five (5) business days after the Second Outside Delivery Date shall be deemed\nTenant’s waiver of its right to terminate this Lease due to a delay in delivery of the Premises.\nIf Landlord is unable to deliver possession of Premises B to Tenant with the Landlord Work and Tenant Improvements therein Substantially Complete on or before the\ndate which is sixty (60) days after the Estimated Commencement Date for Premises B (“Premises B Outside Delivery Date”), which Premises B Outside Delivery Date shall be\nextended on a day-for-day basis for any delay caused by an event of Force Majeure, a Tenant Delay or similar matters beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, Tenant shall\nbe entitled to receive an abatement of Basic Rent for Premises B on a day-for-day basis for each day between the Premises B Outside Delivery Date and the actual date on\nwhich possession of Premises B is delivered to Tenant with the Landlord Work and Tenant Improvements therein Substantially Complete (“Actual Delivery Date for Premises\nB”), to be applied as a credit toward the Basic Rent next due and payable under this Lease (for example, if the Estimated Commencement Date for Premises B is June 1, 2022,\nand the Actual Delivery Date for Premises B is June 5, 2022, then Tenant shall receive a credit toward Basic Rent in an amount equal to four (4) days of Basic Rent for\nPremises B). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Landlord is unable to commence the Landlord Work on Premises on or prior to August 1, 2022 (the “Premises B Work\nCommencement Date”) or (ii) deliver possession of Premises B to Tenant with the Landlord Work and Tenant Improvements therein Substantially Complete on or before the\ndate which is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Estimated Commencement Date for Premises B (“Premises B Second Outside Delivery Date”), which Premises B Work\nCommencement Date and Premises B Second Outside Delivery Date shall be extended on a day-for-day basis for any delay caused by the existing tenant of Premises B failing\nto vacate Premises B in a timely manner, an event of Force Majeure, a Tenant Delay or similar matters beyond the reasonable control of Landlord, then Tenant shall have the\nright to terminate this Lease with respect to Premises B only by delivering Notice thereof to Landlord no later than five (5) business days after the Premises B Work\nCommencement Date or the Premises B Second Outside Delivery Date (as applicable), which termination shall be effective as of the date of such Notice. Tenant’s failure to\ndeliver a Notice of termination within five (5) business days after the applicable date shall be deemed Tenant’s waiver of its right to terminate this Lease with respect to\nPremises B due to a delay in delivery of the Premises. The remedies set forth in this Article 4 shall be Tenant’s sole and exclusive remedies at law or equity for the matters\ndescribed herein.\n- 6 -\nArticle 5\nRENT\n1.1 Basic Rent. Tenant shall pay Landlord as consideration for the use and enjoyment of the Premises the Basic Rent designated in Section 1.12 (subject to\nproration as hereinafter provided) in equal monthly installments, each in advance on the first day of each calendar month during the Term commencing on the applicable\nCommencement Date, except that the first month’s Rent for both Premises shall be paid to Landlord upon delivery to Landlord of a copy of this Lease, executed by Tenant. If\nthe Term of this Lease commences on a day other than the first day of a calendar month or ends on a day other than the last day of a calendar month, then the Rent for such\nperiod shall be prorated on the basis of a thirty (30) day month. Provided that Tenant is not then in default under this Lease beyond any applicable notice and cure period,\nmonthly installments of Basic Rent for each Premises shall be abated for six (6) full months (months two (2) through seven (7) of the Initial Term for each applicable Premises)\n(each an “Abatement Period”). All other terms and provisions of this Lease shall apply to the Premises both during the Abatement Period and thereafter, including, without\nlimitation, the obligation to pay all Additional Rent (defined below).\n1.2 Additional Rent. In addition to the Basic Rent, Tenant agrees to pay as Additional Rent the amount of Rent adjustments and other charges required by this\nLease. Other charges to be paid by Tenant hereunder, including, without limitation, payments for Operating Expenses, Real Property Taxes, insurance, insurance deductibles\nand repairs shall be considered “Additional Rent” for purposes of this Lease. The term “Rent” as used in this Lease shall mean Basic Rent and Additional Rent and all other\namounts payable by Tenant pursuant to this Lease. When no other time is stated herein for payment, payment of any amount due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder shall be\nmade within ten (10) business days after Tenant’s receipt of Landlord’s invoice or statement therefor. All Rent shall be paid to Landlord, without prior demand and without any\ndeduction or offset except as specified herein, in lawful money of the United States of America, at the address designated in Section 1.2 hereof or to such other person or at such\nother place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing.\n1.3 Late Payment. If Tenant fails to pay any installment of Rent when due or in the event Tenant fails to make any other payment for which Tenant is obligated\nunder this Lease when due, such late amount shall accrue interest and Tenant shall pay Landlord as Additional Rent interest on such amount at an annual rate (“Default Rate”)\nequal to the lesser of: (a) the then prevailing prime rate of Bank of America NT & SA (“Prime Rate”) plus six (6) percentage points or (b) the maximum rate permitted by law\nfrom the date such amount became due until such amount is paid. If the format or components of the Prime Rate are materially changed, or if the Prime Rate ceases to exist,\nLandlord shall substitute a prime rate or alternative base rate of interest that is maintained by the Bank of America NT & SA or similar financial institution which Landlord\ndetermines in its reasonable business judgment. In addition to said interest, Tenant shall pay to Landlord concurrently with any installment of Rent, or other payment, not paid\nwithin five (5) days of the date upon which it is due, and Landlord may demand same from Tenant, as Additional Rent, a late charge equal to eight percent (8%) of the late\namount to compensate Landlord for the extra costs incurred as a result of such late payment. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY SUCH LATE PAYMENT MAY CAUSE\nLANDLORD TO INCUR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND OTHER DAMAGE, THE EXACT AMOUNT OF WHICH WOULD BE IMPRACTICABLE OR\nEXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN, AND THAT SUCH INTEREST AND LATE CHARGE REPRESENT A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE\nDETRIMENT THAT LANDLORD WILL SUFFER BY REASON OF LATE PAYMENT BY TENANT. Acceptance of any such interest and late charge shall not constitute a\nwaiver of any Tenant Default with respect to the overdue amount, or prevent Landlord from exercising any of the other rights and remedies available to Landlord hereunder or at\nlaw.\n1.4 Additional Late Payment Remedies. If any payment of Rent made by check, draft or money order is returned to Landlord due to insufficient funds, or\notherwise, Landlord shall have the right, at any time thereafter and upon Notice (defined below) to Tenant, to require Tenant to make all subsequent payments of Rent by\ncashier’s or certified check. Any payment returned to Landlord shall be subject to a handling charge of $50.00. If Tenant fails to pay an installment of Basic Rent within ten\n(10) days following the date the same is due on any three (3) or more occasions during any twelve (12) month period, Landlord shall have the right, in addition to any other\nrights or remedies it may have hereunder or at law, to require Tenant thereafter to pay installments of Basic Rent quarterly in advance.\nArticle 6\nRENT ADJUSTMENT\n1.1 Definitions.

Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.2, all calculations, determinations, allocations and decisions to be made hereunder with respect to\nOperating Expenses and Real Property Taxes shall be made on a triple net basis in accordance with the good faith determination of Landlord applying sound accounting and\nproperty management principles consistently applied which are consistent with Institutional Owner Practices. Landlord shall have the right to equitably allocate some or all\nOperating Expenses among particular classes or groups of tenants in the Project or Buildings (for example, retail tenants) to reflect Landlord’s good faith determination that\nmeasurably different amounts or types of services, work or benefits associated with Operating Expenses, as applicable, are being provided to or conferred upon such classes or\ngroups. All discounts, reimbursements, rebates, refunds, or credits (collectively, “Reimbursements”) attributable to Operating Expenses or Real Property Taxes received by\nLandlord\n- 9 -\nin a particular year shall be deducted from Operating Expenses or Real Property Taxes, as applicable, in the year the same are received; provided, however, if such practice is\nconsistent with Institutional Owner Practices, Landlord may treat Reimbursements generally (or under particular circumstances) on a different basis.\n1.2.2. As of the date of this Lease, Tenant shall pay Additional Rent under this Article 6 based on the Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes for the\nProject. If the Project at any time contains more than one building, Landlord shall have the right, from time to time, to equitably allocate some or all of the Operating Expenses\nand/or Real Property Taxes for the buildings comprising the Project among the Buildings and some or all of the other buildings of the Project. In such event, Landlord shall\nreasonably determine a method of allocating such Operating Expenses and/or Real Property Taxes attributable to the Building and/or such other building(s) of the Project to the\nBuilding and/or such other building(s) and Tenant shall be responsible for paying its proportionate share of such expense(s) which are allocated to the Building. Landlord shall\nalso have the right, from time to time, to require Tenant to pay Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes based solely on the Operating Expenses and\nReal Property Taxes for the Building.\n1.2.3. Notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary, for the sole purpose of calculating Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses, the\nControllable Operating Expenses (as defined below) for each calendar year after the first full calendar year of the Term following the Premises B Commencement Date shall not\nincrease by more than six percent (6%) over the maximum permitted Controllable Operating Expenses for the immediately preceding calendar year (i.e., on a cumulative,\ncompounding basis and regardless of the actual Controllable Operating Expenses incurred for such preceding year); provided, however, that if the actual Controllable Operating\nExpenses for any calendar year are greater than the maximum amount permitted to be charged to Tenant hereunder, then the difference shall be added to the actual Controllable\nOperating Expenses for succeeding years of the Term until exhausted. The term “Controllable Operating Expenses” mean those Operating Expenses for which increases are\nreasonably within the control of Landlord, and shall specifically exclude, without limitation, Utility Expenses (as defined below), Insurance Expenses (as defined below), Real\nProperty Taxes, assessments, the cost of any Project amenities, collectively bargained union wages, costs to comply with governmental laws enacted or first applicable after the\nCommencement Date, trash removal and any services provided by monopolies or where there is otherwise only one (1) provider available to Landlord. For purposes of this\nLease, the following definitions shall apply: (i) “Utility Expenses” shall mean the cost of supplying all utilities to the Project; and (ii) “Insurance Expenses” shall mean the cost\nof insurance required or allowed to be carried by Landlord under this Lease. There shall be no limitation on the amount of increase from year to year on Operating Expenses\nwhich are not Controllable Operating Expenses.\n1.3 Payment of Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes. This shall be a triple net Lease and Basic Rent shall be paid to\nLandlord absolutely net of all costs and expenses, except as specifically provided to the contrary in this Lease. The provisions for payment of Tenant’s Percentage of Operating\nExpenses and Tenant’s Percentage of Real Property Taxes are intended to pass on to Tenant, and reimburse Landlord for, all costs and expenses of the nature described in\nSection 6.1 incurred in connection with the ownership, operation, management, insurance, maintenance and repair of the Project. For each calendar year of the Term, Tenant\nshall pay Tenant’s Percentage of the Operating Expenses and Tenant’s Percentage of the Real Property Taxes paid or incurred by Landlord for such year as Additional Rent.\nTenant shall pay such amounts as follows:\n1.3.1. Estimate of Annual Operating Expenses and Real Property Taxes. At the beginning of each calendar year, or as soon thereafter as practicable,\nLandlord shall deliver to Tenant a reasonable estimate (“Estimated Statement”) of Tenant's Percentage of Operating Expenses and Tenant's Percentage of Real Property Taxes\nfor the then current calendar year. Landlord may revise its estimates of Tenant's Percentage of Operating Expenses and Tenant's Percentage of Real Property Taxes for any year\nfrom time to time in its reasonable discretion, and upon receipt of a revised Estimated Statement, Tenant shall begin making payments under this Section 6.3.1 in accordance\nwith such revised estimates. For each calendar year during the Term of this Lease, or portion thereof, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the estimated Tenant’s Percentage of\nOperating Expenses and the estimated Tenant's Percentage of Real Property Taxes, as specified in the Estimated Statement. These estimated amounts shall be divided into\ntwelve (12) equal monthly installments. Tenant shall pay to Landlord, concurrently with the regular monthly Basic Rent payment next due following the receipt of such an\nEstimated Statement, an amount equal to one monthly installment multiplied by the number of months from the commencement of the calendar year for which such estimates\nwere prepared to the month of such payment, both months inclusive, less any amounts paid under this Section 6.3.1 after commencement of such calendar year based on the last\nEstimated Statement delivered by Landlord. Subsequent payments under this Section 6.3.1 shall be payable concurrently with the regular monthly Rent payments for the\nbalance of that calendar year and shall continue until the next Estimated Statement is delivered by Landlord. Failure of Landlord to deliver an Estimated Statement for any\ncalendar year shall not relieve Tenant of its obligation to make estimated payments of Tenant's Percentage of Operating Expenses and Tenant's Percentage of Real Property\nTaxes under this Section 6.3.1.\n- 10 -\n1.3.2. Annual Reconciliation. At the end of each calendar year or as soon thereafter as practicable Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a statement (“Annual\nReconciliation”) of (a) the actual annual Operating Expenses and Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses for the preceding year, and (b) the actual annual Real Property\nTaxes and Tenant’s Percentage of Real Property Taxes for the preceding year. If for any year, the sum of Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses and Tenant’s Percentage of\nReal Property Taxes (as specified in the Annual Reconciliation) is less than the total amount of the estimated payments made by Tenant under Section 6.3.1 above for such year,\nthen any such overpayment, or overpayments, shall be credited toward the monthly Rent next falling due after determination by Landlord of such overpayment or overpayments\nand shall be paid to Tenant in a lump sum for periods after the expiration of the Term. Similarly, if for any year, the sum of Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses and\nTenant’s Percentage of Real Property Taxes (as specified in the Annual Reconciliation) is more than the total amount of the estimated payments made by Tenant under Section\n6.3.1 above for such year, then any such underpayment, or underpayments, shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord concurrently with the next regular monthly Basic Rent payment\ncoming due after Tenant’s receipt of the Annual Reconciliation (or if the Term shall have expired or terminated, within thirty (30) days following Tenant’s receipt of such\nAnnual Reconciliation).\n1.3.3. Survival of Reconciliation. Even though the Term shall have expired and Tenant shall have vacated the Premises, when the final determination of\nTenant’s Percentage of actual annual Operating Expenses, and/or of Tenant’s Percentage of actual annual Real Property Taxes, for the year in which this Lease terminates is\ndelivered to Tenant, (a) Tenant shall immediately pay any amounts payable to Landlord under Section 6.3.2 above (as a result of any underpayments by Tenant under Section\n6.3.1 above), and/or (b) conversely, Landlord shall promptly rebate any amounts payable to Tenant under Section 6.3.2 (as a result of any overpayments under Section 6.3.1\nabove) provided that no Tenant Default existed at the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.\n1.4 Review of Annual Reconciliation. Provided that Tenant is not then in default with respect to its obligations under this Lease and provided further that Tenant\nstrictly complies with the provisions of this Section 6.4, Tenant shall have the right, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense and upon thirty (30) days prior Notice (“Review Notice”)\nto Landlord delivered no later than sixty (60) days after an Annual Reconciliation is delivered to Tenant, to reasonably review or audit Landlord’s supporting books and records\n(at Landlord’s manager’s corporate offices) for any portion of the Operating Expenses or Real Property Taxes for the particular year covered by such Annual Reconciliation, in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 6.4. To the extent that any amounts specified in such Annual Reconciliation were not previously paid, Tenant shall pay\nall such amounts to Landlord simultaneously with Tenant’s delivery the Review Notice. Except as expressly provided herein, any review or audit of records under this Section\n6.4 shall be at the sole expense of Tenant, shall be conducted by independent certified public accountants of national standing which are not compensated on a contingency fee\nor similar basis relating to the results of such review or audit and shall be completed within sixty (60) days after Landlord provides Tenant with access to Landlord’s supporting\nbooks and records. Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after completion of any such review or audit, deliver Notice to Landlord specifying the items described in the Annual\nReconciliation that are claimed to be incorrect by such review or audit (“Dispute Notice”). The right of Tenant under this Section 6.4 may only be exercised once for each year\ncovered by any Annual Reconciliation, and if Tenant fails to deliver a Review Notice within the sixty (60) day period described above or a Dispute Notice within the thirty (30)\nday period described above, or if Tenant fails to meet any of the other above conditions of exercise of such right, the right of Tenant to review or audit a particular Annual\nReconciliation (and all of Tenant’s rights to make any claim relating thereto) under this Section 6.4 shall automatically be deemed waived by Tenant. Tenant acknowledges and\nagrees that any records of Landlord reviewed or audited under this Section 6.4 (and the information contained therein) constitute confidential information of Landlord, which\nshall not be disclosed other than to Tenant’s accountants performing the review or audit and principals of Tenant who receive the results of the review or audit. If Landlord\ndisagrees with Tenant’s contention that an error exists with respect to the Annual Reconciliation in dispute, Landlord shall have the right to cause another review or audit of that\nportion of the Annual Reconciliation to be made by a firm of independent certified public accountants of national standing selected by Landlord (“Landlord’s Accountant”). In\nthe event of a disagreement between the two accounting firms, the review or audit of Landlord’s Accountant shall be deemed to be correct and shall be conclusively binding on\nboth Landlord and Tenant. In the event that it is finally determined pursuant to this Section 6.4 that a particular Annual Reconciliation overstated amounts payable by Tenant\nunder this Article 6 with respect to the applicable year by more than five percent (5%), Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable costs of Tenant’s accountant and\nLandlord shall be liable for the costs of Landlord’s Accountant. In all other cases, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the reasonable costs of Landlord’s Accountant.\nArticle 7\nSECURITY DEPOSIT\n1.1 Security Deposit. Tenant shall deposit with Landlord, upon delivery to Landlord of a copy of this Lease executed by Tenant, the Security Deposit designated\nin Section 1.14. Said sum shall be held by Landlord as security for the full and faithful performance by Tenant of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease to\n- 11 -\nbe kept and performed by Tenant during the Term hereof and any extension hereof. Landlord shall have the right, but not the obligation, to apply all or any portion of the\nSecurity Deposit for the payment of Rent or any other sum due hereunder, to cure any default by Tenant of its obligations with respect to the restoration and surrender of the\nPremises or to cure any Tenant Default at any time, in which event Tenant shall be obligated to restore the Security Deposit to its original amount within ten (10) business days,\nand Tenant’s failure to do so shall be deemed to be a Default under this Lease. Tenant hereby irrevocably waives and relinquishes any and all rights, benefits, or protections, if\nany, Tenant now has, or in the future may have, under Section 1950.7 of the California Civil Code, any successor statute, and all other provisions of law, now or hereafter in\neffect, including, but not limited to, any provision of law which: (a) establishes the time frame by which a landlord must refund a security deposit under a lease, or (b) provides\nthat a landlord may claim from a security deposit only those sums reasonably necessary to remedy defaults in the payment of Rent, to repair damage caused by a tenant, or to\nclean the subject premises. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that: (i) any statutory time frames for the return of a security deposit are superseded by the express period identified\nin this Section 7.1 and (ii) rather than be so limited, Landlord may claim from the Security Deposit: (A) any and all sums expressly identified in this Section 7.1, and (B) any\nadditional sums reasonably necessary to compensate Landlord for any and all losses or damages caused by Tenant’s default of this Lease, including, but not limited to, all\ndamages or Rent due upon termination of this Lease pursuant to Section 1951.2 of the California Civil Code, as amended and recodified from time to time. Landlord shall not\nbe required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general funds, and Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on such Security Deposit. Within thirty (30) days following\nthe expiration of the Term, Landlord shall (provided that Tenant is not in Default under this Lease) return the Security Deposit to Tenant, less such portion as Landlord shall\nhave applied in accordance with this Section 7.1. Should Landlord sell its interest in the Premises during the Term hereof and if Landlord deposits with (or gives a credit to) the\npurchaser thereof the then balance of the Security Deposit held by Landlord, Landlord shall be released from any further liability with respect to the Security Deposit.\n1.2 Lease Guaranty. As a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this Lease, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a Lease Guaranty in the form of Exhibit “D”\nexecuted by Guarantor concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Lease.\nArticle 8\nUSE\n1.1 General. Tenant shall use the Premises for the Permitted Use set forth in Section 1.16 above, and shall not use or permit the Premises to be used for any other\npurpose without the prior written consent of Landlord. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to give Tenant any exclusive right to such use in the Project or any portion\nthereof (excluding only the Premises).\n1.2 Laws/CC&R’s.\n1.2.1. Tenant shall not use or occupy the Premises in violation of any applicable laws, regulations, rules, orders, statutes or ordinances of any\nGovernmental Authority, office, board or private entity in effect on or after the Effective Date and applicable to the Project or the use or occupancy of the Project, including,\nwithout limitation, the rules, regulations and requirements of the Pacific Fire Rating Bureau, and of any similar body, the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Section\n12101 et seq.) (“ADA”) and Hazardous Material Laws (as defined in Section 8.3.7 below) (collectively, “Laws”) or in violation of any government-issued permit for the\nBuildings or Project or any of the Rules and Regulations (as defined below), and shall, upon Notice from Landlord, discontinue any use of the Premises which is declared by\nany Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be a violation of any Laws, or of any government-issued permit for the Buildings or Project. On or before the applicable\nCommencement Date, Landlord shall cause the Buildings and the Premises to comply with all applicable Laws (including, but not limited to, any obligation imposed pursuant to\nthe ADA). Except as expressly set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, Tenant shall cause the Premises to comply with all applicable Laws and shall comply with any\ndirection of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction which shall, by reason of the nature of Tenant’s use or occupancy of the Premises, impose any obligation\n(including, but not limited to, any obligation imposed pursuant to the ADA as a result of Tenant’s particular use of the Premises), upon Tenant or Landlord with respect to the\nPremises or with respect to the use or occupancy thereof; provided, however, unless resulting from an Alteration performed by Tenant or by Tenant’s specific use of the\nPremises (as opposed to general office and laboratory/research and development use), Tenant shall not be responsible for any obligation imposed by the ADA after completion\nof the initial Tenant Improvements with respect to the Common Areas (except its prorata share of compliance costs included in Operating Expenses). Tenant shall comply with\nall rules, orders, regulations and requirements of the Pacific Fire Rating Bureau or any other organization performing a similar function. Tenant shall not do or permit to be done\nin or about the Premises anything which causes the insurance on the Premises, the Buildings or the Project or any portion thereof to be canceled or the cost thereof increased.\nTenant shall promptly, upon demand, reimburse Landlord for any additional premium charged for any insurance policy by reason of Tenant’s failure to comply with the\nprovisions of this Section 8.2. In determining whether increased premiums are a result of Tenant’s use of the Premises, a schedule issued by the organization computing the\ninsurance rate on the\n- 12 -\nProject or the Tenant Improvements showing the various components of such rate shall be conclusive evidence of the several items and charges which make up such rate.\nTenant shall promptly comply with all reasonable requirements of the insurance authority or any present or future insurer relating to the Premises. Tenant shall not do or permit\nanything to be done in or about the Premises which will in any way obstruct or interfere with the rights of Landlord or other tenants or occupants of the Buildings, the Parking\nArea or the Project, or injure or unreasonably annoy them, or use or allow the Premises to be used for any improper, immoral, unlawful or objectionable purpose, nor shall\nTenant cause, maintain or permit any legal nuisance in or about the Premises or the Project. Tenant shall comply with all restrictive covenants and obligations created by private\ncontracts that affect the use and operation of the Premises, the Buildings, the Common Areas or any other portion of the Project. Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be\ncommitted any waste in or upon the Premises or the Project and shall keep the Premises in first class repair and appearance. If any governmental license or permit shall be\nrequired for the proper and lawful conduct of Tenant’s business in the Premises, Tenant, at its expense, shall procure, maintain and comply with the terms and conditions of each\nsuch license or permit.\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing:\n(A) Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate, and Tenant shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to participate in governmentally\nmandated regulations or voluntary traffic management programs applicable to businesses located in the area or to the Project. Neither this Section 8.2.1(A) nor any other\nprovision of this Lease, however, is intended to or shall create any rights or benefits in any other person, firm, company, Governmental Authority or the public. Upon Tenant’s\nfailure to comply with this Section 8.2.1(A), Landlord may suspend Tenant’s parking privileges in addition to taking such other remedies as may be available to a landlord\nagainst a defaulting tenant.\n(B) Landlord and Tenant agree to cooperate and comply with any and all guidelines or controls imposed upon either Landlord or Tenant by any\nGovernmental Authority or by any energy conservation association to which Landlord is a party concerning energy management\n(C) All costs, fees, assessments and other charges paid by Landlord to any Governmental Authority or voluntary association in connection with\nany program of the types described in Sections 8.2.1(A) and 8.2.1(B) above, and all costs and fees paid by Landlord to any Governmental Authority or third party pursuant to or\nto effect such program, shall be included in Operating Expenses for the purposes of Article 6, whether or not specifically listed in such Article 6.\n(D) Tenant shall be liable for all penalties, noncompliance costs or other losses, costs or expenses incurred by Landlord primarily as a result of\nTenant’s failure to comply with any of the provisions of Sections 8.2.1(A) through 8.2.1(C) above. Any such amount shall be payable by Tenant to Landlord within ten (10)\nbusiness days after Landlord’s demand therefor as Additional Rent. Failure of Tenant to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2.1(D) when due shall be deemed a\nTenant Default pursuant to this Lease.\n1.2.2. Tenant shall be responsible for all structural engineering reasonably required to determine structural load for any of Tenant’s furniture, fixtures,\nequipment, other personal property, Alterations and Tenant Improvements; provided that Landlord reserves the right to prescribe the weight and position of all file cabinets,\nsafes and heavy equipment which Tenant desires to place in the Premises so as to properly distribute the weight thereof. Further, Tenant’s business machines and mechanical\nequipment which cause vibration or noise that may be transmitted to the Building structures or to any other space in the Buildings shall be so installed, maintained and used by\nTenant as to eliminate such vibration or noise.\n1.3 Hazardous Materials.\n1.3.1. Tenant shall not cause or permit any Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section 8.3.7 below) to be brought upon, kept or used in or about the\nPremises, the Buildings or the Project in violation of applicable Laws by Tenant or any of its employees, agents, representatives, contractors or invitees (collectively with\nTenant, each a “Tenant Party”). If (a) Tenant breaches such obligation, (b) the presence of Hazardous Materials as a result of such a breach results in contamination of the\nProject, any portion thereof, or any adjacent property, (c) contamination of the Premises otherwise occurs during the Term or any extension or renewal hereof or holding over\nhereunder or (d) contamination of the Project occurs as a result of Hazardous Materials that are placed on or under or are released into the Project by a Tenant Party, then Tenant\nshall indemnify, save, defend (at Landlord’s option and with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold the Landlord Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section 22.1.2\nbelow) harmless from and against any and all Claims (as defined in Article 20 below) of any kind or nature, including (i) diminution in value of the Project or any portion\nthereof, (ii) damages for the loss or restriction on use of rentable or usable space or of any amenity of the Project, (iii) damages arising from any adverse impact on marketing of\nspace in the Project or any portion thereof and (iv) sums paid in settlement of Claims that arise before, during or after the Term as a result of such breach or contamination. This\nindemnification by Tenant includes costs incurred in connection with any investigation of site conditions or any clean-up, remedial, removal or restoration work required by any\nGovernmental Authority because of Hazardous Materials present in the air, soil or\n- 13 -\ngroundwater above, on, under or about the Project. Without limiting the foregoing, if the presence of any Hazardous Materials in, on, under or about the Project, any portion\nthereof or any adjacent property caused or permitted by any Tenant Party results in any contamination of the Project, any portion thereof or any adjacent property, then Tenant\nshall promptly take all actions at its sole cost and expense as are necessary to return the Project, any portion thereof or any adjacent property to its respective condition existing\nprior to the time of such contamination; provided that Landlord’s written approval of such action shall first be obtained, which approval Landlord shall not unreasonably\nwithhold; and provided, further, that it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent if such actions could have a material adverse long-term or short-term effect on\nthe Project, any portion thereof or any adjacent property. Tenant’s obligations under this Section shall not be affected, reduced or limited by any limitation on the amount or\ntype of damages, compensation or benefits payable by or for Tenant under workers’ compensation acts, disability benefit acts, employee benefit acts or similar legislation.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant shall have no liability, responsibility, duty or obligation for any Hazardous Materials conditions existing as of the\nCommencement Date (including, without limitation, any obligation to indemnify or hold Landlord harmless) to the extent not caused, contributed to or exacerbated by a Tenant\nParty.\n1.3.2. Landlord acknowledges that it is not the intent of this Article to prohibit Tenant from operating its business for the Permitted Use. Tenant may\noperate its business according to the custom of Tenant’s industry so long as the use or presence of Hazardous Materials is strictly and properly monitored in accordance with\napplicable Laws. As a material inducement to Landlord to allow Tenant to use Hazardous Materials in connection with its business, Tenant agrees to deliver to Landlord (a) a\nlist identifying each type of Hazardous Material to be present at the Premises that is subject to regulation under any environmental applicable Laws (other than customary\nquantities of typical office and cleaning supplies, provided no permits or approvals from, and no notice or disclosure to, any Governmental Authorities is required in connection\nwith the presence of such supplies at the Premises), (b) a list of any and all approvals or permits from Governmental Authorities required in connection with the presence of\nsuch Hazardous Material at the Premises and (c) correct and complete copies of (i) notices of violations of applicable Laws related to Hazardous Materials and (ii) plans relating\nto the installation of any storage tanks to be installed in, on, under or about the Project (provided that installation of storage tanks shall only be permitted after Landlord has\ngiven Tenant its written consent to do so, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion) and closure plans or any other documents required by any\nand all Governmental Authorities for any storage tanks installed in, on, under or about the Project for the closure of any such storage tanks (collectively, “Hazardous Materials\nDocuments”). Tenant shall deliver to Landlord updated Hazardous Materials Documents, within fourteen (14) days after receipt of a written request therefor from Landlord, not\nmore often than once per year, unless (m) there are any changes to the Hazardous Materials Documents or (n) Tenant initiates any Alterations or changes its business, in either\ncase in a way that involves any material increase in the types or amounts of Hazardous Materials. For each type of Hazardous Material listed, the Hazardous Materials\nDocuments shall include (t) the chemical name, (u) the material state (e.g., solid, liquid, gas or cryogen), (v) the concentration, (w) the storage amount and storage condition\n(e.g., in cabinets or not in cabinets), (x) the use amount and use condition (e.g., open use or closed use), (y) the location (e.g., room number or other identification) and (z) if\nknown, the chemical abstract service number. Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, Tenant shall not be required to provide Landlord with any Hazardous\nMaterials Documents containing information of a proprietary nature, which Hazardous Materials Documents, in and of themselves, do not contain a reference to any Hazardous\nMaterials or activities related to Hazardous Materials. Landlord may, at Landlord’s expense, cause the Hazardous Materials Documents to be reviewed by a person or firm\nqualified to analyze Hazardous Materials to confirm compliance with the provisions of this Lease and with applicable Laws. In the event that a review of the Hazardous\nMaterials Documents indicates non-compliance with this Lease or applicable Laws, Tenant shall, at its expense, diligently take steps to bring its storage and use of Hazardous\nMaterials into compliance. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary or Landlord’s review into Tenant’s Hazardous Materials Documents or use or disposal of\nhazardous materials, however, Landlord shall not have and expressly disclaims any liability related to Tenant’s or other tenants’ use or disposal of Hazardous Materials, it being\nacknowledged by Tenant that Tenant is best suited to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its Hazardous Materials usage and procedures.\n1.3.3. At any time, and from time to time, Landlord shall have the right to conduct appropriate tests of the Project or any portion thereof to demonstrate\nthat Hazardous Materials are present or that contamination has occurred due to the acts or omissions of a Tenant Party. Tenant shall pay all reasonable costs of such tests if such\ntests reveal that Hazardous Materials exist at the Project in violation of Tenant’s obligations under this Lease.\n1.3.4. Tenant shall not install or utilize any underground or other storage tanks storing Hazardous Materials on the Premises without Landlord’s prior\nwritten consent, which consent may be withheld in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion. Subject to the foregoing, if underground or other storage tanks storing Hazardous\nMaterials installed or utilized by Tenant are located on the Premises, or are hereafter placed on the Premises by Tenant (or by any other party, if such storage tanks are utilized\nby Tenant), then Tenant shall monitor the storage tanks, maintain appropriate records, implement reporting procedures, properly close any underground storage tanks, and take\nor cause to be taken all other steps necessary or required under the applicable Laws.\n- 14 -\n1.3.5. Tenant shall promptly report to Landlord any actual or suspected presence of toxic or potentially toxic mold or water intrusion at the Premises of\nwhich Tenant has notice.\n1.3.6. Tenant’s obligations under this Section 8.3 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease. During any period of time needed by\nTenant or Landlord after the termination of this Lease to complete the removal from the Premises of any Hazardous Materials, Tenant shall be deemed a holdover tenant and\nsubject to the provisions of Section 8.3.\n1.3.7. As used in this Lease, the term “Hazardous Material” means any toxic, explosive, corrosive, flammable, infectious, radioactive, carcinogenic,\nmutagenic or otherwise hazardous substance, material or waste that is or becomes regulated by applicable Laws or any Governmental Authority, and the term “Hazardous\nMaterial Laws” means and includes all now and hereafter existing statutes, laws, ordinances, codes, regulations, rules, rulings, orders, decrees, directives, policies and\nrequirements by any federal, state or local governmental authority regulating, relating to, or imposing liability or standards of conduct concerning public health and safety, the\nenvironment or any Hazardous Material, including, without limitation, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (42\nU.S.C. Section 9601 et seq.), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq.), and California Health and Safety Code (Sections 25100,\n25249.5, 25316 and 39000, et seq. in each case).\n1.3.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Landlord shall have sole control over the equitable allocation of control areas (as defined in\nthe California Building Standards Code) within the Project for the storage of Hazardous Materials. Without limiting the foregoing, if the use of Hazardous Materials by Tenant\nis such that Tenant utilizes fire control areas in the Project in excess of Tenant’s Percentage of the Buildings or the Project, as applicable, then Tenant shall, at its sole cost and\nexpense and upon Landlord’s written request, establish and maintain a separate area of the Premises classified by the California Building Standards Code as a “Group H”\noccupancy area for the use and storage of Hazardous Materials, or take such other action as is necessary to ensure that its share of the fire control areas of the Buildings and the\nProject is not greater than Tenant’s Percentage of the Buildings or the Project, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, Landlord shall not have and\nexpressly disclaims any liability related to Tenant’s or other tenants’ use or disposal of fire control areas, it being acknowledged by Tenant that Tenant and other tenants are best\nsuited to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its Hazardous Materials usage and procedures.\n1.4 Odors and Exhaust. Tenant acknowledges that Landlord would not enter into this Lease with Tenant unless Tenant assures Landlord that under no\ncircumstances will any other occupants of the Buildings or the Project, if any, be subjected to odors or fumes (whether or not noxious), and that the Buildings and the Project\nwill not be damaged by any exhaust, in each case from Tenant’s operations. Landlord and Tenant therefore agree as follows:\n1.4.1. Tenant shall not cause or permit (or conduct any activities that would cause) any release of any odors or fumes of any kind from the Premises.\n1.4.2. If the Buildings have a ventilation system that, in Landlord’s judgment, is adequate, suitable, and appropriate to vent the Premises in a manner that\ndoes not release odors affecting any indoor or outdoor part of the Project, Tenant shall vent the Premises through such system. If Landlord at any time determines that any\nexisting ventilation system is inadequate, or if no ventilation system exists, Tenant shall in compliance with applicable Laws vent all fumes and odors from the Premises (and\nremove odors from Tenant’s exhaust stream) as Landlord requires. The placement and configuration of all ventilation exhaust pipes, louvers and other equipment shall be\nsubject to Landlord’s approval. Tenant acknowledges Landlord’s desire to maintain the Project (indoor and outdoor areas) in an odor-free manner, and Landlord may require\nTenant to abate and remove all odors in a manner that goes beyond the requirements of applicable Laws.\n1.4.3. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, provide odor eliminators and other devices (such as filters, air cleaners, scrubbers and whatever\nother equipment may in Landlord’s judgment be necessary or appropriate from time to time) to completely remove, eliminate and abate any odors, fumes or other substances in\nTenant’s exhaust stream that in Landlord’s judgment, emanate from Tenant’s Premises. Any work Tenant performs under this Section shall constitute Alterations.\n1.4.4. Tenant’s responsibility to remove, eliminate and abate odors, fumes and exhaust shall continue throughout the Term. Landlord’s construction of the\nTenant Improvements shall not preclude Landlord from requiring additional measures to eliminate odors, fumes and other adverse impacts of Tenant’s exhaust stream (as\nLandlord may designate in Landlord’s discretion). Tenant shall install additional equipment as Landlord requires from time to time under the preceding sentence. Such\ninstallations shall constitute Alterations.\n1.4.5. If Tenant fails to install satisfactory odor control equipment within ten (10) business days after Landlord’s demand made at any time, then Landlord\nmay, without limiting Landlord’s other rights and remedies, require Tenant to cease and suspend any operations in the Premises that, in Landlord’s determination,\n- 15 -\ncause odors, fumes or exhaust. For example, if Landlord determines that Tenant’s production of a certain type of product causes odors, fumes or exhaust, and Tenant does not\ninstall satisfactory odor control equipment within ten (10) business days after Landlord’s request, then Landlord may require Tenant to stop producing such type of product in\nthe Premises unless and until Tenant has installed odor control equipment satisfactory to Landlord.\n1.4.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 8.4 to the contrary, during any period of time in which Tenant is the sole occupant of the\nProject, Tenant’s obligations to control and/or mitigate odors, exhaust and fumes as set forth in this Section 8.4 shall be limited to the extent such obligations are required by\napplicable Laws.\nArticle 9\nMOLD\nTenant agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Premises in a manner that prevents the occurrence of an infestation of toxic, or potentially toxic,\nmold, mildew, microbial growths, and any associated mycotoxins in the Premises, and shall comply, at a minimum, with the following: (a) Tenant agrees to immediately\nfix/abate any water intrusion in the Premises to the extent such action is required to be undertaken by Tenant pursuant to its maintenance obligations under this Lease, or, if not\nwithin Tenant’s maintenance obligations, then Tenant agrees to immediately notify Landlord of any such water intrusion; (b) Tenant agrees to use all reasonable care to close all\nwindows and other openings in the Premises to prevent outdoor water from penetrating into the interior unit; (c) Tenant agrees to clean and dry any visible moisture on\nwindows, walls, and other surfaces, including personal property, as soon as reasonably possible after discovery; (d) Tenant agrees to keep the Premises free of dirt and debris\nthat could reasonably be expected to harbor mold; (e) Tenant agrees to regularly clean and sanitize kitchens and other surfaces within the Premises where water, moisture\ncondensation, and mold could reasonably be expected to collect; (f) Tenant agrees not to interfere with regular air flow and circulation throughout the Premises; (g) Tenant\nagrees to limit the indoor watering of plants; (h) Tenant agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the overflow or release of water from bathrooms or kitchens,\nincluding but not limited to toilets, sinks, kitchen appliances, and other receptacles of water; (i) Tenant agrees not to obstruct fresh air supply to furnace, air conditioner or heater\nducts; (j) Tenant agrees to maintain and not obstruct ventilation at all locations in the Premises; (k) Tenant agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the clogging\nof all plumbing within the Premises; (l) Tenant agrees not to engage in any conduct that would reasonably be expected to promote or create mold growth; (m) Tenant agrees to\nreport, within forty-eight (48) hours after Tenant discovery, the following to Landlord: (i) any non-working fan, heater, air conditioner or ventilation system; (ii) plumbing leaks,\ndrips, sweating pipes, wet spots; (iii) overflows from bathroom, kitchen, or other facilities, including, but not limited to, tubs, showers, shower enclosures, toilets, sinks, kitchen\nappliances, or other receptacles of water, especially in cases where the overflow may have permeated walls, floors, ceilings or fixtures; (iv) water intrusion of any kind; (v) any\nmold or black or brown spots or moisture on surfaces inside the Premises; (vi) broken plumbing systems or standing water near structures within the Premises; and (vii) any\nodors consistent with mold growth within the Premises. Tenant agrees not to commence any mold investigation, testing, remediation or repair without first obtaining the prior\nwritten consent of Landlord. If Landlord consents to any mold investigation, remediation or repair by Tenant, Tenant agrees to not use any methods of mold investigation,\ntesting, remediation and repair that are speculative and not generally accepted within the scientific community, and Landlord reserves the right to approve any and all third\nparties retained by Tenant to conduct any such mold investigation, testing, remediation and repair. As of the Effective Date such speculative and generally unaccepted methods\nof investigation, testing, remediation and repair include: (A) any use of settled dust vacuum sampling; (B) any use of interior wall cavity air sampling; (C) Tenant’s use of do-\nit-yourself mold investigation kits; and (D) use of any other methods that have not been peer reviewed and generally accepted within the scientific community.\nArticle 10\nNOTICES\n1.1 Method of Delivery. Any notice, consent, approval or objection required or permitted by this Lease (a “Notice”) shall be in writing and may be delivered: (a)\nin person (by hand or by messenger or courier service) or (b) by certified or registered mail or United States Postal Service Express Mail, with postage prepaid, or (c) by a\nnationally recognized overnight delivery service that provides delivery verification, addressed to Tenant at the Premises and to Landlord at each of the addresses designated in\nSection 1.2, and shall be deemed sufficiently given if served in a manner specified in thisA rticle 10. Either party may specify a different address for Notice purposes by Notice\nto the other.\n1.2 Receipt of Notices. Any Notice sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be deemed given on the date of delivery shown on the\nreceipt card, or if no delivery date is shown, the postmark thereon. Notices delivered by United States Postal Service Express Mail or overnight delivery service that guarantees\nnext day delivery shall be deemed given on the next business day after delivery of the same to the United\n- 16 -\nStates Postal Service or overnight delivery service. If any Notice is received on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, it shall be deemed received on the next business day.\n1.3 Statutory Service of Notice. When a statute permits, or requires, service of a notice in a particular manner, service of that notice (or a similar Notice\npermitted, or required, by this Lease) in the manner permitted, or required, by this Article 10 shall replace and satisfy the statutory service-of-notice procedures, including, but\nnot limited to, those required by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1162, or any similar or successor statute.\nArticle 11\nBROKERS\nTenant warrants that it has had no dealings with any real estate broker, finder or agent in connection with the negotiation of this Lease except for the broker(s) whose\nname(s) is (are) set forth in Section 1.16, whose commission shall be payable by Landlord pursuant to one or more separate agreements, and that it knows of no other real estate\nbroker, finder or agent who is or might be entitled to a commission in connection with this Lease. Tenant shall be solely responsible for the payment of any fee due to any other\nbroker, finder, agent or other party claiming under Tenant, and shall hold Landlord free and harmless against any liability in respect thereto, including attorneys’ fees and costs\nincurred by Landlord in connection therewith.\nArticle 12\nHOLDING OVER\nIf Tenant holds over after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term hereof without the express written consent of Landlord, Tenant shall become a Tenant at\nsufferance, at a Basic Rent equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the Rent payable during the last month of the Term, and otherwise subject to the terms,\ncovenants and conditions herein specified, so far as applicable. Acceptance by Landlord of Rent after such expiration or earlier termination without Landlord’s prior written\nconsent shall not waive Landlord’s right to evict Tenant without thirty (30) days prior written notice. The foregoing provisions of this Article 12 are in addition to and do not\naffect Landlord’s right of reentry or any rights of Landlord hereunder or as otherwise provided by law. If Tenant fails to surrender the Premises upon the expiration or earlier\ntermination of this Lease, Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from all Claims, including, without limitation, any claim made by any succeeding tenant\nfounded on or resulting from such failure to surrender, lost profits and other consequential damages, and any and all attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by Landlord in\nconnection Tenant’s failure to surrender the Premises in accordance with the provisions of this Lease on the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.\nArticle 13\nTAXES ON TENANT’S PROPERTY\n1.1 Personal Property and Fixtures. Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay, at least ten (10) days before delinquency, all taxes levied against any of Tenant’s\nPersonal Property (defined below) placed by Tenant or any Tenant Party in or about the Premises. If any such taxes on Tenant’s Personal Property are levied against Landlord or\nLandlord’s property, or if the assessed value of the Premises, Buildings or Project is increased by the inclusion therein of a value placed upon such Tenant’s Personal Property,\nand if Landlord, after Notice to Tenant, pays the taxes based upon such increased assessment, which Landlord shall have the right to do regardless of the validity thereof (but\nonly under proper protest if so requested by Tenant), Tenant shall, upon demand, repay to Landlord the taxes so levied against Landlord, or the portion of such taxes resulting\nfrom such increase in the assessment.\n1.2 Tenant Improvements. If the Leasehold Improvements (defined below) in the Premises, whether installed and/or paid for by Landlord or Tenant and whether\nor not affixed to the real property so as to become a part thereof, are assessed for real property tax purposes at a valuation higher than the valuation at which tenant\nimprovements conforming to Landlord’s “Building Standard Improvements” (as defined in the Work Letter Agreement) for other space in the Buildings are assessed, then the\nreal property taxes and assessments levied against the Buildings or Project by reason of such excess assessed valuation shall be deemed to be taxes levied against Tenant’s\nPersonal Property and shall be governed by the provisions of Section 13.1 above. If the records of the County Assessor are available and sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis\nfor determining whether the Leasehold Improvements are assessed at a higher valuation than Landlord’s “Building Standard Improvements”, such records shall be binding on\nboth Landlord and Tenant. If the records of the County Assessor are not available or sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for making said determination, the actual cost of\nconstruction shall be used.\n1.3 Additional Taxes.

Tenant acknowledges and agrees that, except with respect to the Landlord Work: (a) Tenant has inspected, or has had the opportunity to inspect, the\nProject, the Buildings and the Premises and, subject to Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, acknowledges that the same are acceptable for Tenant’s intended use and agrees\nto accept them in their “AS IS, WHERE IS” condition, (b) except as expressly provided in this Lease, neither Landlord nor any agent of Landlord has made any representation\nor warranty with respect to the Premises, the Buildings, the Parking Area or any other portion of the Project or with respect to the condition thereof or the suitability of the same\nfor the conduct of Tenant’s business, (c) except as expressly provided in the Work Letter Agreement and Section 16.2 below, and subject to the express representations and\nwarranties of Landlord set forth in this Lease, Landlord shall have no obligation to alter, remodel, improve, repair, decorate or paint the Premises or any part thereof, or any\nportion of the Buildings or Project and (d) except as expressly provided in this Lease, Landlord shall have no obligation to provide Tenant with any allowance, rent credit or\nabatement in connection with Tenant’s entering into this Lease.

Without limiting the foregoing, Tenant’s\nexecution of the Memorandum of Terms shall constitute a specific acknowledgment and acceptance of the various start-up inconveniences that may be associated with the use\nof the Buildings, the Parking Area and other portions of the Project, such as certain construction obstacles (e.g., scaffolding), delays in use of freight elevator service,\nunavailability of certain elevators for Tenant’s use, uneven air-conditioning services and other typical conditions incident to recently constructed (or recently modified) office\nand laboratory/research and development buildings. Tenant (for itself and all other claiming through Tenant) hereby irrevocably waives and releases its right to terminate this\nLease under Section 1932(l) of the California Civil Code. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Landlord represents, to the actual knowledge of Steve Bollert,\nwithout a duty to inquire or investigate, that, as of the Commencement Date, (a) the Premises are not in material violation of any Laws, and (b) there are no damages or defects\nexisting in the Premises that would not be visible upon an in-person inspection of the Premises.\n1.2 Limited Warranty. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 14.1, Landlord hereby warrants that all Building Systems (as that term is defined in\nSection 15.1 below) servicing the Premises shall be in good working order and condition for a period of twelve (12) months beginning on the Commencement Date. In the event\nof a failure of the foregoing warranty, provided that Tenant delivers Notice thereof to Landlord within the applicable twelve (12) month period, then Landlord shall cure such\nfailure within a reasonable period of time after receiving such Notice and the cost thereof shall be at Landlord’s sole cost and expense and shall not be included in Operating\nExpenses, except to the extent such failure is caused by Tenant or any Tenant Party, in which event Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost to cure such failure.\nArticle 15\nALTERATIONS\n1.1 Alterations and Major Alterations. Except for Permitted Alterations, Tenant shall make no alterations, additions, or improvements in or to the Premises\n(collectively, the “Alterations”) without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed for all Alterations other\nthan Major Alterations (which shall be granted in Landlord’s sole discretion), and then only by licensed contractors or mechanics approved by Landlord in writing, which\napproval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (provided that any contractors performing any Major Alterations shall be subject to approval by Landlord\nin its sole and absolute discretion). Tenant shall submit to Landlord plans and specifications for any proposed Alterations to the Premises, and may not make such Alterations\nuntil Landlord has approved such plans and specifications and the contractor performing any Alterations in writing. Tenant shall construct such Alterations in accordance with\nthe plans and specifications approved by Landlord and in compliance with all applicable Laws,\n- 18 -\nand shall not amend or modify such plans and specifications without Landlord’s prior written consent. If any proposed Alterations require the consent or approval of any lessor\nof a superior lease or the holder of a mortgage encumbering the Premises, Tenant acknowledges that such consent or approval must be secured prior to the construction of such\nAlterations. Tenant agrees not to construct or erect partitions or other obstructions that might interfere with Landlord’s free access to mechanical installations or service facilities\nof the Buildings or interfere with the moving of Landlord’s equipment to or from the enclosures containing said installations or facilities. All Alterations shall be done at such\ntimes and in such manner as Landlord may from time to time reasonably designate. Tenant will pay the entire cost and expense of all Alterations, including, without limitation,\nfor any painting, restoring or repairing of the Premises or the Buildings necessitated by the Alterations, and Landlord’s actual out-of-pocket third party review and Landlord’s\nsupervision fee in an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the cost of the Alterations in question (except for Permitted Alterations in which case Tenant shall not be required to\npay Landlord any supervision fee).

The insurance policies described in clause (b) of this Section 15.1 must name Landlord, Landlord’s lender (if any), Bioscience Properties, Inc.\n(“Property Manager”) and other parties reasonably requested by Landlord as additional insureds, specifically including completed operations. Tenant covenants and agrees that\nall Alterations done by Tenant shall be performed in full compliance with all Laws. If any Governmental Authority requires any alterations or modifications to the Buildings or\nthe Premises as a result of Tenant’s Permitted Use of the Premises or as a result of any Alteration to the Premises made by or on behalf of Tenant, Tenant will pay the cost of all\nsuch alterations or modifications. If any such Alterations involve any modifications to (i) the structural portions of the Buildings, (ii) the mechanical, electrical, plumbing,\nfire/life safety or heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems of the Buildings (collectively, “Building Systems”) or (iii) any portion of the Buildings outside of the interior\nof the Premises (a “Major Alteration”), it shall be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any such Major Alterations and it shall be reasonable for Landlord to\ncondition its consent to any Major Alterations on Landlord making the Major Alterations, provided that Landlord may first require Tenant to deposit with Landlord an amount\nsufficient to pay the cost of the Major Alterations (including, without limitation, reasonable overhead, administrative costs and profit). Before commencing any work, Tenant\nshall give Landlord at least ten (10) days’ Notice of the proposed commencement of such work and shall, if required by Landlord, deliver a copy of the completion and payment\nbond required by Landlord in form, substance and amount satisfactory to Landlord. “Permitted Alterations” means only cosmetic and non-structural Alterations and usual and\ncustomary maintenance and repairs of Leasehold Improvements if and to the extent that such cosmetic and non-structural Alterations, maintenance and repairs: (A) are of a type\nand extent which are customarily permitted to be made without consent by landlords acting consistently with Institutional Owner Practices leasing similar space for similar uses\nto similar tenants, (B) are in compliance with the Rules and Regulations and all applicable Laws, (C) are not Major Alterations, and (D) do not cost more than Fifty Thousand\nand 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) in each instance.\n1.2 Removal of Alterations and Tenant’s Personal Property. The Tenant Improvements together with all Alterations upon the Premises made by Tenant after\nthe Commencement Date, including, without limitation, all wall coverings, built-in cabinet work, paneling and the like (collectively, “Leasehold Improvements”), shall, at\nLandlord’s election given at the time Landlord approves such Alterations, either be removed by Tenant or shall become the property of Landlord and shall remain upon, and be\nsurrendered with, the Premises at the end of the Term hereof; provided, however, that if Landlord, by Notice to Tenant at the time Landlord approves such Alterations, requires\nTenant to remove any such Leasehold Improvements, Tenant shall repair all damage resulting from such removal or, at Landlord’s option, shall pay to Landlord the cost of such\nremoval, as reasonably estimated by Landlord, prior to the expiration of the Term of this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall not be required, nor have the right,\nto remove the Tenant Improvements furnished pursuant to the Work Letter Agreement. All articles of personal property and all business and trade fixtures, cabling, machinery\nand equipment, furniture and movable partitions owned by Tenant or any other Tenant Party or that are installed by or for Tenant or any other Tenant Party at its expense in the\nPremises (collectively, “Tenant’s Personal Property”) shall be and remain the property of Tenant and shall be removed by Tenant prior to the expiration of the Term, and Tenant\nshall repair all damage to the Premises, if any, resulting from such removal. If Tenant shall fail to remove any of the foregoing from the Premises prior to termination of this\nLease for any cause whatsoever, Tenant shall be deemed to be holding over in the Premises without the consent of Landlord and Landlord may, at its option, remove the same\nin any manner that Landlord shall choose, and store the same without liability to Tenant for loss thereof. In such event, Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord upon demand, any and\nall expenses incurred in such removal (including court costs and attorneys’ fees) and storage charges thereon, for any length of time that the same shall be in Landlord’s\npossession or control. Landlord may, at its option, without Notice, sell such property, or any of the same, at a private sale and without legal process, for such price as Landlord\nmay obtain and apply the proceeds of such sale to any amounts due under this Lease from Tenant to Landlord and/or to all expenses, including attorneys’ fees and costs, incident\nto the removal and/or sale thereof.\n- 19 -\nArticle 16\nREPAIRS\n1.1 Tenant Obligations. Tenant shall, when and if needed, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense and subject to Section 14.2 and Article 15 above, make all repairs to\nthe Premises and every part thereof (including all structural and non-structural parts, but excluding the roof membrane) to maintain the Premises in the condition and repair that\nexisted as of the Commencement Date, reasonable wear and tear and casualty damage excepted, and free from any Hazardous Materials.

Landlord shall maintain, repair and replace the structural portions of the Buildings (including, without limitation, the roof structure,\nroof membrane, slab and exterior walls) outside of the Premises, the Parking Area and the Building Systems, and, except as expressly set forth in Section 14.2 above, the costs\nincurred by Landlord in performing such maintenance, repairs and replacements shall be included in Operating Expenses to the extent permitted under Section 6.1 above. For\npurposes of clarification, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair, maintain or replace any part of the Premises, any Building Systems exclusively serving the Premises\n(except as expressly set forth in Section 14.2 above) or any Supplemental Equipment. Landlord shall not be liable for any failure to make any repairs or replacements or to\nperform any maintenance to the extent that the need for such repairs, replacements or maintenance is caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of any Tenant Party.\nExcept as provided in Articles 23 and 24 hereof, there shall be no abatement of Rent and no liability of Landlord by reason of any injury to or interference with Tenant’s\nbusiness arising from the making of any repairs, alterations, improvements or replacements in or to any portion of the Buildings or the Premises or in or to fixtures,\nappurtenances and equipment therein. Tenant waives the right to make repairs and replacements at Landlord’s expense under any Law now or hereafter in effect including\nSection 1941 and 1942 of the California Civil Code (as the same may be amended from time to time) and any successor statute and similar Law now or hereafter in effect.\nArticle 17\nLIENS\nTenant shall not cause or permit to be filed against the Premises, the Buildings or the Project or of any portion thereof or against Tenant’s leasehold interest in the\nPremises any mechanics’, materialmen’s or other liens, including without limitation any state, federal or local “superfund” or Hazardous Materials cleanup lien imposed as a\nresult of the presence of Hazardous Materials in, on or about the Premises, the Buildings or any other portion of the Project. Landlord shall have the right at all reasonable times\nto post and keep posted on the Premises any notices that it deems necessary for protection from such liens. Tenant shall discharge any lien filed against the Premises or against\nthe Buildings for work claimed to have been done for, or materials claimed to have been furnished to, Tenant, by bond or otherwise, within ten (10) business days after the filing\nthereof, at the cost and expense of Tenant. If any such liens are filed and Tenant fails to discharge them pursuant to the foregoing sentence, Landlord may, without waiving its\nrights and remedies based on such breach of Tenant and without releasing Tenant from any of its obligations hereunder, cause such lien(s) to be released by any means it shall\ndeem proper, including payments in satisfaction of the claim giving rise to such lien or by obtaining a corporate statutory mechanic’s lien release bond in an amount equal to one\nhundred fifty percent (150%) of such lien claim. Tenant shall: (a) pay to Landlord, immediately upon Notice from Landlord, any cost or expense, including, without limitation,\nattorneys’ fees and costs, incurred by Landlord by reason of Tenant’s failure to discharge any such lien, together with interest thereon at the maximum rate per annum permitted\nby Law from the date of such payment by Landlord and (b) shall indemnify, defend and hold the Landlord Indemnified Parties harmless from and against any liens.\nArticle 18\nENTRY BY LANDLORD\nLandlord reserves and shall at any and all reasonable times and upon at least twenty-four (24) hours prior notice to Tenant (except in the case of an emergency) and\nduring normal business hours (except in the case of an\n- 20 -\nemergency) have the right to enter the Premises to supply any service to be provided by Landlord to Tenant hereunder, to inspect the same, to show the Premises to prospective\npurchasers, lenders, or investors and during the last twelve (12) months of the Term or following a default by Tenant to prospective tenants, to post notices of non-responsibility,\nto alter, improve or repair the Premises or any other portion of the Buildings and/or the Project, as provided in Section 2.4 above, or for any other reasonable purpose, all\nwithout being deemed guilty of any eviction of Tenant and without abatement of Rent. Landlord may, in order to carry out such purposes, erect scaffolding and other necessary\nstructures where reasonably required by the character of the work to be performed, provided that the business of Tenant shall be interfered with as little as is reasonably\npracticable. Tenant hereby waives any claim for damages for any injury or inconvenience to or interference with Tenant’s business, for any loss of occupancy or quiet enjoyment\nof the Premises and for any other loss in, upon and about the Premises, the Buildings or the Project on account of Landlord’s entry or work permitted by this Article 18 or by\nSection 2.4 above, except to the extent caused by Landlord’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that in no event shall Landlord be liable for\nconsequential damages or lost profits. Without limiting the foregoing, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption or interference to Tenant’s\nbusiness during such entry. Landlord shall at all times have and retain a key with which to unlock all doors in the Premises, excluding Tenant’s vaults and safes. Landlord shall\nhave the right to use any and all means that Landlord may deem proper to open said doors in an emergency in order to obtain entry to the Premises. Any entry to the Premises\nobtained by Landlord by any of said means, or otherwise, shall not be construed or deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into the Premises, or an eviction of Tenant from\nthe Premises or any portion thereof, and any damages caused on account thereof shall be paid by Tenant.\nArticle 19\nUTILITIES AND SERVICES\n1.1 Premises Utilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, Tenant shall pay for the cost of all water (including the cost to service, repair and\nreplace reverse osmosis, de-ionized and other treated water), electricity, gas, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (“HVAC”), light, power, telephone, internet service, cable\ntelevision, other telecommunications and other utilities supplied to the Premises, together with any fees, surcharges and taxes thereon. All such utilities and services provided to\nthe Premises that are separately metered shall be paid by Tenant directly to the supplier of such utilities or services. If any such utility is not separately metered to Tenant,\nTenant shall pay Tenant’s Percentage of all charges of such utility jointly metered with other premises as Additional Rent or, in the alternative, Landlord may, at its option,\nmonitor the usage of such utilities by Tenant and charge Tenant with the cost of purchasing, installing and monitoring such metering equipment, which cost shall be paid by\nTenant as Additional Rent. Landlord may base its bills for utilities on reasonable estimates; provided that Landlord adjusts such billings promptly thereafter or as part of the\nnext Annual Reconciliation to reflect the actual cost of providing utilities to the Premises. In the event that the Buildings or Project is less than fully occupied during a calendar\nyear, Tenant acknowledges that Landlord may extrapolate utility usage that varies depending on the occupancy of the Buildings or Project (as applicable) to equal Landlord’s\nreasonable estimate of what such utility usage would have been had the Buildings or Project, as applicable, been one hundred percent (100%) occupied during such calendar\nyear; provided, however, that Landlord shall not recover more than one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of such utilities. Landlord may, in Landlord’s sole and absolute\ndiscretion, at any time and from time to time, contract, or require Tenant to contract, for utility services (including generation, transmission, or delivery of the utility service)\nwith a utility service provider(s) of Landlord’s choosing. Tenant shall fully cooperate with Landlord and any utility service provider selected by Landlord. Tenant shall permit\nLandlord and the utility service provider to have reasonable access to the Premises and the utility equipment serving the Premises, including lines, feeders, risers, wiring, pipes,\nand meters.

Tenant shall keep the Premises at all times in a clean and orderly condition, at Tenant’s\nexpense and to the reasonable satisfaction of Landlord. Unless otherwise agreed to by Landlord, no one other than persons approved by Landlord shall be permitted to enter the\nPremises for the purpose of providing janitorial or cleaning service.\n1.3 Landlord Exculpation. Landlord’s failure to furnish or cause to be furnished any service which Landlord is required or elects to provide hereunder shall not\nresult in any liability to Landlord. Landlord shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, or expense that Tenant may incur as a result of any change of utility service,\nincluding any change that makes the utility supplied less suitable for Tenant’s needs, or for any failure, interruption, stoppage, or defect in any utility service. In addition, Tenant\nshall not be entitled to any abatement or reduction of Rent, no eviction of Tenant shall result from and Tenant shall not be relieved from the performance of any covenant or\nagreement in this Lease by reason of any such change, failure, interruption, stoppage or defect. In the event of any such failure, interruption, stoppage or defect of a service\nwhich Landlord is required to provide\n- 21 -\nhereunder, Landlord shall diligently attempt to cause service to be resumed promptly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Tenant is prevented from using, and does\nnot use, the Premises or any portion thereof, as a result of a failure to provide any services or utilities to the Premises, to the extent within Landlord’s reasonable control, which\nLandlord is required to provide under this Lease (an “Abatement Event”), then Tenant shall give Landlord written Notice of such Abatement Event, and if such Abatement\nEvent continues for five (5) consecutive business days after Landlord’s receipt of such Notice (“Eligibility Period”) and Landlord does not diligently commence and pursue to\ncompletion the remedy of such Abatement Event, then, except to the extent covered by business interruption or similar insurance carried or required to be carried by Tenant\nhereunder, Basic Rent, Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses and Tenant’s Percentage of Real Property Taxes shall be abated or reduced, as the case may be, after\nexpiration of the Eligibility Period for such time that Tenant continues to be so prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or a portion thereof, in the proportion that\nthe rentable area of the portion of the Premises that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total rentable area of the Premises. If, however, Tenant\nreoccupies any portion of the Premises during such period, the Basic Rent, Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses and Tenant’s Percentage of Real Property Taxes\nallocable to such reoccupied portion, based on the proportion that the rentable area of such reoccupied portion of the Premises bears to the total rentable area of the Premises,\nshall be payable by Tenant from the date Tenant reoccupies such portion of the Premises. Such right to abate Basic Rent, Tenant’s Percentage of Operating Expenses and\nTenant’s Percentage of Real Property Taxes shall be Tenant’s sole and exclusive remedy at law or in equity for an Abatement Event. Except as expressly provided in this\nSection 19.3, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to mean that Tenant is excused from paying Rent due hereunder.\n1.4 Intentionally Deleted.\n1.5 Common Area Water. Landlord shall provide water in the Common Area for, to the extent applicable, lavatory and landscaping purposes only, which water\nshall be from the local municipal or similar source.\n1.6 Energy Tracking.

Tenant acknowledges that any utility information for the Premises, the Buildings and the Project may be shared with third parties, including Landlord’s consultants\nand Governmental Authorities. In addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall comply with all applicable Laws related to the disclosure and tracking of energy consumption at the\nPremises. The provisions of this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.\n1.7 Reservation of Rights. Landlord reserves the right to stop service of the plumbing, ventilation, air conditioning and utility systems, when Landlord deems\nnecessary or desirable, due to accident, emergency or the need to make repairs, alterations or improvements, until such repairs, alterations or improvements shall have been\ncompleted, and Landlord shall further have no responsibility or liability for failure to supply plumbing, ventilation, air conditioning or utility service when prevented from doing\nso by Force Majeure (as defined in Section 36.8 below) or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Landlord’s negligence. Without limiting the foregoing, it is expressly\nunderstood and agreed that any covenants on Landlord’s part to furnish any service pursuant to any of the terms, covenants, conditions, provisions or agreements of this Lease,\nor to perform any act or thing for the benefit of Tenant, shall not be deemed breached if Landlord is unable to furnish or perform the same by virtue of Force Majeure or, to the\nextent permitted by applicable Law, Landlord’s negligence.\nArticle 20\nINDEMNIFICATION AND EXCULPATION OF LANDLORD\nTenant shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Landlord Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section 22.1.2 below) from and against any and all claims, demands,\npenalties, fines, liabilities, actions (including, without limitation, informal proceedings), settlements, judgments, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees\nand costs) of whatever kind or nature, known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, incurred or suffered by or asserted against such Landlord Indemnified Party (collectively,\n“Claims”) arising from or in connection with, directly or indirectly, (a) any cause whatsoever in the Premises (including, but not limited to, Claims resulting in whole or in part\nfrom the negligence of the Landlord Indemnified Party), except to the extent directly caused by the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of such Landlord Indemnified\nParty, (b) the presence at or use or occupancy of the Premises or Project by a Tenant Party, (c) any act, neglect, fault or omission on the part of any Tenant Party, or (d) a breach\nor default by Tenant in the performance of any of its obligations hereunder. Payment shall not be a condition precedent to enforcement of the foregoing indemnity. In case any\naction or proceeding shall be brought against any Landlord Indemnified Party by reason of any such Claim, at such Landlord Indemnified Party’s option, upon Notice from\nLandlord, Tenant shall defend the same at Tenant’s expense by counsel selected by\n- 22 -\nLandlord in its sole discretion. Tenant, as a material part of the consideration to Landlord, hereby assumes all risk of damage to property (including, without limitation, any\ndamage to personal property or scientific research, including loss of records kept by Tenant within the Premises (in each case, regardless of whether such damage is\nforeseeable)) or injury to Tenant or any other Tenant Parties in, upon or about the Premises, the Buildings, the Parking Area or the Project from any cause whatsoever and\nhereby waives all Claims (including consequential damages and claims for injury to Tenant’s business or loss of income arising out of any loss of use of the Premises, the\nBuildings, the Parking Area or the Project or any equipment or facilities therein, or relating to any such damage or destruction of personal property as described in this Section)\nin respect thereof against each Landlord Indemnified Party, except that which is solely caused by, or solely the result of: (i) any Landlord Default (defined below), (ii) the\ngrossly negligent acts of such Landlord Indemnified Party, or (iii) the willful misconduct of such Landlord Indemnified Party. Landlord shall not be liable for any damages\narising from any act, omission or neglect of any other tenant in the Project, or of any other third party, except to the extent arising from the gross negligence or willful\nmisconduct of Landlord. Tenant acknowledges that security devices and services, if any, while intended to deter crime, may not in given instances prevent theft or other criminal\nacts. Landlord shall not be liable for injuries or losses caused by criminal acts of third parties, and Tenant assumes the risk that any security device or service may malfunction\nor otherwise be circumvented by a criminal. If Tenant desires protection against such criminal acts, then Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, obtain appropriate\ninsurance coverage. Without limitation on other obligations of Tenant that survive the expiration of the Term, the clauses of this Article 20 shall survive the expiration or earlier\ntermination of this Lease until all Claims against the Landlord Indemnified Parties involving any of the indemnified matters are fully, finally, and absolutely barred by the\napplicable statutes of limitations.\nSubject to the provisions of Section 22.4 below, Landlord shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tenant from and against any and all third party claims, demands,\npenalties, fines, liabilities, actions (including, without limitation, informal proceedings), settlements, judgments, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable\nattorneys’ fees and costs) of whatever kind or nature, known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, incurred or suffered by or asserted against Tenant to the extent proximately\ncaused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord in connection with Landlord’s activities on or about the Buildings or Project.\nArticle 21\nDAMAGE TO TENANT’S PROPERTY\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Article 20 or anything to the contrary in this Lease, no Landlord Indemnified Party shall be liable for: (a) loss or damage to any\nproperty by theft or any other cause whatsoever, (b) any injury or damage to persons resulting from fire, storms, earthquakes, explosion, falling plaster, steam, gas, electricity,\nwater or rain which may leak from any part of the Buildings or the Project or from the pipes, appliances or plumbing work therein or from the roof, street or sub-surface or from\nany other place or resulting from dampness or any other cause whatsoever, except that which is solely caused by, or solely the result of: (i) the grossly negligent acts of such\nLandlord Indemnified Party, (ii) the willful misconduct of such Landlord Indemnified Party, or (iii) any latent defect in the Premises, the Buildings or any other portion of the\nProject that is not promptly remedied by Landlord following Landlord's receipt of notice thereof. Tenant shall immediately give Notice to Landlord in case of the occurrence of\nany fire or accidents in or about the Premises, the Buildings or any other portion of the Project, or the discovery of any defects therein (including, without limitation, any latent\ndefect in the Premises) or in any fixtures or equipment that are the property of Landlord, Tenant or any other tenant or occupant of premises in the Project.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, Tenant acknowledges that safety and access control devices, services and programs provided by Landlord, if any, while intended to\ndeter crime and ensure safety, may not in given instances prevent theft or other criminal acts, or ensure safety of persons or property. The risk that any safety or access control\ndevice, service or program may not be effective, or may malfunction, or be circumvented by a criminal, is assumed by Tenant with respect to Tenant’s property and interests,\nand Tenant shall obtain insurance coverage to the extent Tenant desires protection against such criminal acts and other losses, as further described in Article 22. Tenant agrees to\ncooperate in any reasonable safety or security program developed by Landlord or required by Law.\nArticle 22\nINSURANCE\n1.1 Tenant’s Insurance. Tenant shall, during the Term hereof (and during any period that Tenant may enter, occupy and/or use the Premises prior to the\nCommencement Date and any holdover period), at its sole cost and expense, keep in full force and effect the following insurance:\n1.1.1.

Coverage shall be maintained with limits of not less than $1,000,000 per incident with a\n$2,000,000 policy aggregate.\n1.1.9. Any other form or forms of insurance as Tenant or Landlord or any mortgagees of Landlord may reasonably require from time to time in form, in\namounts and for insurance risks against which a prudent tenant would protect itself.\n1.1.10. Tenant may place all or any of the foregoing insurance coverages under blanket insurance policies carried by Tenant provided that no other loss\nwhich may also be insured by such blanket insurance shall affect the insurance coverages required hereby and so long as such policy complies with the amount of coverage\nrequired hereunder and otherwise provides the same protection as would a separate policy insuring only Tenant’s insurance obligations in compliance with the provisions of\nSection 22.1 hereof. In addition, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a certificate specifically stating that such coverages apply to Landlord, the Premises, the Buildings and the\nProject.\n1.1.11.

Tenant shall also require that such vendor’s or\ncontractor’s insurance meet the same additional terms as required of Tenant herein with regards to adding the Landlord Indemnified Parties and all mortgagees as additional\ninsureds, maintaining primary and non-contributory coverage, waiving all rights of recovery and subrogation, and making certificates of insurance available as evidence of all\npolicies during the term of their work and in advance of all applicable renewals. Tenant shall not allow any vendors or contractors to begin work prior to obtaining certificates\nevidencing all insurance requirements contained herein.\n1.2 Standard of Insurance. All policies shall be written in a form satisfactory to Landlord, and the Commercial General Liability, Comprehensive Automobile\nLiability, Umbrella/Excess Liability, Liquor Liability (if applicable) and Pollution Legal Liability policies required under Section 22.1 shall name all Landlord Indemnified\nParties as additional insureds on a primary and non-contributory basis. In addition, if Tenant places any such required coverages under a blanket insurance policy as set forth in\nSection 22.1.11, the blanket policy shall name all Landlord Indemnified Parties as additional insureds on a primary and non-contributory basis via blanket endorsement. All\ninsurance policies required under Section 22.1 shall be issued by companies authorized to do business in the State of California with an A.M. Best’s Rating of at least A-/VIII.\nNo deductibles or Self-Insured Retention (“SIR”) of Tenant shall exceed $25,000 (provided, however, the flood insurance may have a deductible of $100,000 and the EQSL\ninsurance may have a deductible of $50,000) without Landlord’s prior written approval. All deductibles and SIR are the responsibility of Tenant and must be shown on the\ncertificate of insurance. On or before the date which is ten (10) days after the execution of this Lease, and prior to or on the renewal of such policies thereafter, Tenant shall\ndeliver to Landlord certificates evidencing the existence of the amounts and forms of coverage satisfactory to Landlord. No such policy shall be cancelable or reducible in\ncoverage except after written notice to Landlord per the policy conditions. Any insurance limits required by this Lease are minimum limits only and not intended to restrict the\nliability imposed on any Tenant for liability under this Lease. Tenant shall, prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Landlord with renewals or “binders” thereof, or\nLandlord may order such insurance and charge the cost thereof to Tenant as Additional Rent. If Landlord obtains any insurance that is the responsibility of Tenant under this\nArticle 22, Landlord shall deliver to Tenant a written statement setting forth the cost of any such insurance and showing in reasonable detail the manner in which it has been\ncomputed and Tenant shall remit said amount to Landlord within ten (10) business days.\n1.3 Landlord Insurance.\n1.3.1. During the Term of this Lease, Landlord shall insure the Buildings and the Parking Areas (to the extent Landlord is the owner thereof) (excluding\nany property which Tenant is obligated to insure under Sections 22.1 and 22.2 hereof) against damage with All-Risk insurance (which may, but shall not be required to, insure\nagainst earthquake damage) and public liability insurance, all in such amounts and with such deductibles as Landlord and Tenant jointly and reasonably consider appropriate.\nLandlord may, but shall not be obligated to,\n- 25 -\nobtain and carry any other form or forms of insurance as Landlord or Landlord’s mortgagees may determine advisable. Notwithstanding any contribution by Tenant to the cost\nof insurance premiums, as provided herein, Tenant acknowledges that it has no right to receive any proceeds from any insurance policies carried by Landlord.\n1.3.2. If any of Landlord’s insurance policies shall be canceled or cancellation shall be threatened or the coverage thereunder reduced or threatened to be\nreduced in any way because of Tenant’s specific use of the Premises or any part thereof by Tenant or any assignee or subtenant of Tenant or by anyone Tenant permits on the\nPremises and, if Tenant fails to remedy the condition giving rise to such cancellation, threatened cancellation, reduction of coverage, threatened reduction of coverage, increase\nin premiums, or threatened increase in premiums, within three (3)days after Notice thereof, Landlord may, at its option, but without any obligation so to do, enter upon the\nPremises and attempt to remedy such condition, and Tenant shall promptly pay the cost thereof to Landlord as Additional Rent.\n1.4 Subrogation Waivers.\n1.4.1. Subrogation Waiver – Policies Other than Property Insurance. Tenant hereby waives all rights against the Landlord Indemnified Parties,\nLandlord’s contractors (and their subcontractors of every tier), and their respective employees and agents, for any claims that arise from Tenant’s work or activities and for\nrecovery of damages under Tenant’s insurance policies required under Section 22.1 or any other insurance policy carried by Tenant related to the Premises or this Lease\n(excluding Tenant’s property insurance, which is addressed hereunder in Section 22.4.2). Tenant shall obtain an endorsement effecting the foregoing waiver with respect to its\nworkers compensation and employers liability insurance. If any other policy implicated by the waiver in this Section 22.4.1 does not allow the applicable insured party to waive\nrights of recovery against others prior to a loss, the applicable insured shall obtain an endorsement effecting the applicable waiver.\n1.4.2. Subrogation Waiver – Property Insurance. Landlord and Tenant waive all rights against each other for damages caused by fire or other causes of\nloss occurring on and after the date on which this Lease is executed to the extent such damages are covered (or are required to be covered) by any property insurance required\nunder this Article 22 (including business income and loss of rent insurance) or otherwise carried by such party in relation to the Premises, the Buildings or the Project, regardless\nof whether such insurance is specifically required under this Lease. Tenant’s waiver in this Section 22.4.2 also extends to the Landlord Indemnified Parties. Each party shall\nobtain an endorsement pursuant to which its insurers waive their subrogation rights against the parties specified in this Section 22.4.2. The waivers in this Section 22.4.2 will be\neffective as to a person or entity even though that person or entity would otherwise have a duty of indemnification, did not pay the insurance premium directly or indirectly, or\ndid not have an insurable interest in the property damaged. To the extent that either party self-insures for its insurance obligations under this Lease (e.g., maintains a deductible\namount), such party shall be treated as an independent insurer with full waiver of subrogation.\n1.5 Exclusions. Landlord shall not be liable for any injury or damage to persons or property resulting from fire, explosion, falling plaster, steam, gas, electricity,\nelectrical or electronic emanations or disturbance, water, rain or leaks from any part of the Buildings or from the pipes, or caused by dampness, vandalism, malicious mischief\nor by any other cause of whatever nature, unless caused by or due to the gross negligence of Landlord, its agents, servants or employees, and then only after (i) reasonable prior\nnotice to Landlord of the condition claimed to constitute negligence, if applicable, and (ii) the expiration of a reasonable time after such notice has been received by Landlord\nwithout Landlord having taken all reasonable and practicable means to cure or correct such condition; and pending such cure or correction by Landlord, Tenant shall take all\nreasonably prudent temporary measures and safeguards to prevent any injury, loss or damage to persons or property. In no event shall Landlord be liable for any loss, the risk of\nwhich is covered by Tenant’s insurance or is required to be so covered by this Lease; nor shall Landlord or its agents be liable for any such damage caused by other persons in\nthe Buildings or caused by operations in construction of any private, public, or quasi-public work; nor shall Landlord be liable for any latent defect in the Premises or in the\nBuildings.\nArticle 23\nDAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION\n1.1 Damages. If the Premises are damaged by fire or other perils covered by Landlord’s insurance, Landlord shall:\n1.1.1. In the event of one hundred percent (100%) destruction of the Premises (“Total Destruction”), at Landlord’s option, as soon as reasonably possible\nthereafter, commence repair, reconstruction and restoration of the Premises and prosecute the same diligently to completion, in which event this Lease shall remain in full force\nand effect; provided, however, that if within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such damage, Landlord shall by Notice to Tenant elect not to so repair, reconstruct or\nrestore the Premises, this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such Total Destruction.\n- 26 -\n1.1.2. In the event of a partial destruction of the Premises and if the damage thereto is such that the Premises is capable of being repaired, reconstructed or\nrestored within a period of ninety (90) days from the date of Landlord’s discovery of such damage, and if Landlord will receive insurance proceeds sufficient to cover the total\ncost of such repairs, reconstruction or restoration, Landlord shall commence and proceed diligently with the work of repairs, reconstruction and restoration of the Premises and\nthis Lease shall continue in full force and effect. If such work of repair, reconstruction and restoration shall require a period longer than ninety (90) days or exceeds twenty-five\npercent (25%) of the full replacement cost of the Premises, or if insurance proceeds will not be sufficient to cover the cost of such repairs, reconstruction and restoration, then\nLandlord either may elect to so repair, reconstruct or restore and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect or may elect not to repair, reconstruct or restore and this Lease\nshall then terminate as of the date of such partial destruction. Under any of the conditions of this Section 23.1.2, Landlord shall give Notice to Tenant of its intention regarding\nrepairs, including Landlord’s good faith estimate of the time required to substantially complete such repairs (“Landlord’s Repair Notice”), within said ninety (90) day period.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, if the partial destruction (or if there is 100% destruction referenced in Section 23.1.1) causes more than fifty percent\n(50%) of the Rentable Square Feet of the Premises to be unusable for the Permitted Use and Landlord’s Repair Notice estimates that the repairs will take more than one hundred\neighty (180) days after the occurrence thereof to substantially complete, and if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease, then Tenant shall have the right to terminate this\nLease by Notice to Landlord delivered within ten (10) business days following delivery of Landlord’s Repair Notice, which termination shall be effective no earlier than thirty\n(30) days after delivery of such Notice to Landlord. If damage is due to any cause other than fire or other peril covered by extended coverage insurance, Landlord may elect to\nterminate this Lease.\n1.1.3. In any case where Landlord elects to repair, restore or reconstruct the Premises following the occurrence of any damage to which this Article 23\napplies, then Tenant shall assign to Landlord the proceeds of its property insurance attributable to the Leasehold Improvements. If the cost of restoring the Leasehold\nImprovements exceeds the amount of the proceeds of Tenant’s property insurance that are received by Landlord, Tenant shall promptly pay the amount of such deficiency to\nLandlord upon demand.\n1.2 Termination of Lease. Upon any termination of this Lease under any of the provisions of this Article 23, the parties shall be released without further\nobligation to the other from the date possession of the Premises is surrendered to Landlord except for items which have therefore accrued and/or are then unpaid or items which\nexpressly survive the expiration or sooner termination of this Lease.\n1.3 Rent Abatement. In the event of any casualty, the Rent payable under this Lease shall be abated proportionately with the degree to which Tenant’s Permitted\nUse of the Premises is impaired either during the period of such repair, reconstruction or restoration or until termination of the Lease pursuant to this Article 23, but only to the\nextent that Landlord is compensated for such loss by the insurance carried or required to be carried pursuant to Section 22.1.4 above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall\nbe no abatement of Rent if such damage is caused primarily by the negligence or intentional wrongdoing of Tenant or any Tenant Party. Tenant shall not be entitled to any\ncompensation or damages for loss in the use of the whole or any part of the Premises and/or any inconvenience or annoyance occasioned by such damage, repair, reconstruction\nor restoration. If Landlord is obligated to or elects to repair or restore as herein provided, Landlord shall be obligated to repair or restore only those portions of the Premises\nwhich were originally provided at Landlord’s expense, and the repair and restoration of items not provided at Landlord’s expense shall be the obligation of Tenant.\n1.4 Damage Near End of Term. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 23, if material damage to the Premises occurs during the last\ntwelve (12) months of the Term, either party may elect, no earlier than sixty (60) days after the date of the damage and not later than ninety (90) days after the date of such\ndamage, to terminate this Lease by written notice to the other effective as of the date specified in the notice, which date shall not be less than ten (10) business days nor more\nthan sixty (60) days after the date such notice is given.\n1.5 Waiver of Statute. In the event of damage to the Premises, Tenant shall not be released from any of its obligations under this Lease except to the extent and\nupon the conditions expressly stated in this Article 23. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1932, Subsection 2, and Section 1933, Subsection\n4, and any other statute or court decision relating to the abatement or termination of a lease upon destruction of the Premises and the provisions of this Article 23 shall govern in\ncase of such destruction.\nArticle 24\nEMINENT DOMAIN\n1.1 Permanent Taking. If all of the Premises, or such part thereof as shall substantially interfere with Tenant’s Permitted Use and occupancy thereof, shall be\ntaken for any public or quasi-public purpose by any lawful power or authority by exercise of the right of appropriation, condemnation or eminent domain, or sold to prevent such\ntaking (a “Taking”), either party shall have the right to terminate this Lease by Notice to the other effective as of the date possession is required to be surrendered to said\nauthority. Tenant shall not assert any claim against Landlord or the taking authority for any compensation because of such Taking, and Landlord shall be entitled to\n- 27 -\nreceive the entire amount of any award without deduction for any estate or interest of Tenant. If the amount of property or the type of estate taken shall not substantially\ninterfere with the conduct of Tenant’s business, Landlord shall be entitled to the entire amount of the award without deduction for any estate or interest of Tenant, Landlord\nshall restore the Premises to substantially their same condition prior to such partial Taking, and Basic Rent shall be reduced, effective as of the date the condemning authority\ntakes possession, in the same proportion which the Rentable Square Feet of the portion of the Premises so taken bears to the Rentable Square Feet of the entire Premises before\nthe Taking. Nothing contained in this Section 24.1 shall be deemed to give Landlord any interest in any award made to Tenant for the taking of personal property and fixtures\nbelonging to Tenant or for relocation costs and expenses.\n1.2 Temporary Taking. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 24.1 above, in the event of Taking of the Premises or any part thereof for temporary\nuse, (a) this Lease shall be and remain unaffected thereby and Rent shall not abate, and (b) Tenant shall be entitled to receive for itself such portion or portions of any award\nmade for such use with respect to the period of the Taking which is within the Term, provided that if such Taking shall remain in force at the expiration or earlier termination of\nthis Lease, Tenant shall then pay to Landlord a sum equal to the reasonable cost of performing Tenant’s obligations under Section 15.2 above and Article 31 below with respect\nto surrender of the Premises and, upon such payment, shall be excused from such obligations. For purpose of this Article 24, a “temporary” Taking shall be defined as a Taking\nfor a period of two hundred seventy (270) days or less and a “permanent” Taking shall be defined as a Taking for a period of more than two hundred seventy (270) days.\n1.3 Waiver of Statute. Tenant (for itself and all others claiming through Tenant) hereby irrevocably waives and releases its rights under Section 1265.130 of the\nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure.\nArticle 25\nDEFAULTS AND REMEDIES\n1.1 Tenant Default. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events, upon the expiration of any applicable time period, shall constitute a default\nhereunder by Tenant (“Tenant Default”):\n1.1.1. Abandonment of the Premises by Tenant. Notwithstanding the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1951.3, “Abandonment” is defined to\ninclude, but not limited to, any absence by Tenant from the Premises for thirty (30) days or longer while in default pursuant to any other provision of this Section 25.1;\n1.1.2. The failure by Tenant to make any payment of Rent or any other payment required to be made by Tenant hereunder, as and when due, where such\nfailure shall continue for a period of three (3) business days after Landlord’s delivery of Notice thereof;\n1.1.3. The failure by Tenant to obtain and keep in force at all times any insurance Tenant is required to obtain and keep in force underA rticle 22 where\nsuch failure is not cured within five (5) business days after Landlord’s delivery of Notice of such failure;\n1.1.4. Hypothecation, assignment or other transfer of this Lease or subletting of the Premises, or attempts of such actions in violation ofA rticle 27 of this\nLease;\n1.1.5. The failure by Tenant to deliver any certificate, instrument or statement that is required to be delivered by Tenant underA rticle 28, Article 29 or\nSection 36.16 within the time frames required in Article 28, Article 29 or Section 36.16, as applicable, which Tenant fails to cure within five (5) business days after Landlord’s\ndelivery of Notice thereof;\n1.1.6. The failure by Tenant to observe or perform any of the express or implied covenants or provisions of this Lease to be observed or performed by\nTenant, other than as specified in Sections 25.1.1 – 25.1.5 above or Section 25.1.7 below, where such failure shall continue for a period of thirty (30) days after Landlord’s\ndelivery of Notice thereof; provided that if the nature of any such failure is such that more than thirty (30) days are reasonably required for its cure, then no Tenant Default shall\nbe deemed to occur if (and for so long as) Tenant commences the cure of such failure within said thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to\ncompletion within ninety (90) days after Landlord’s delivery of Notice thereof; or\n1.1.7. The (a) making by Tenant of any general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (b) filing by or against Tenant of a petition to have Tenant adjudged\na bankrupt or a petition for reorganization or arrangement under any Law relating to bankruptcy; (c) appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of\nTenant’s assets located at the Premises or of Tenant’s interest in this Lease; (d) attachment, execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant’s assets located at\nthe Premises or of Tenant’s interest in this Lease; or (f) Tenant’s convening of a meeting of its creditors or any class thereof for the purpose of effecting a moratorium upon or\ncomposition of its debts, or any class thereof; provided that no Tenant Default will be deemed to occur under this Section 25.1.7 if (i) any petition described in clause (a) above\nthat filed against (rather than by) Tenant, is\n- 28 -\ndismissed within thirty (30) days) after filing, (ii) in the event any trustee or receiver shall take possession of substantially all of Tenant’s assets located at the Premises or\nTenant’s interest in this Lease, possession of the same is restored to Tenant within thirty (30) days or (iii) any attachment, execution or other judicial seizure described in clause\n(d) above is discharged within thirty (30) days.\nAny Notice from Landlord required hereby shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any Notice required under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161\nregarding unlawful detainer actions or any similar successor statute. Accordingly, Tenant (for itself and all others claiming through Tenant) hereby expressly and irrevocably\nwaives the notice requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1162 that would otherwise govern notices required under Section 1161, and agrees that any notice\nprovided pursuant to this Section 25.1 shall replace and satisfy any such requirements of Section 1162.\n1.2 Landlord Remedies. In the event of any such Tenant Default, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, including, without\nlimitation, the remedies available under California Civil Code Section 1951.2 and any successor statute, Landlord shall have the immediate option to terminate this Lease and all\nrights of Tenant hereunder. In the event that Landlord shall elect to so terminate this Lease then Landlord may recover from Tenant:\n1.2.1. The worth at the time of award of any unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of such termination; plus\n1.2.2. the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award\nexceeds the amount of such Rent loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; plus\n1.2.3. the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid Rent for the balance of the Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of\nsuch Rent loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; plus\n1.2.4. any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform Tenant’s obligations\nunder this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including but not limited to the cost of recovering possession of the Premises,\nexpenses of reletting, including necessary repair, renovation and alteration of the Premises, reasonable attorneys’ fees and any other reasonable costs; and\n1.2.5. at Landlord’s election, such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by applicable Law.\nAs used in Sections 25.2.1 and 25.2.2 above, the “worth at the time of award” is computed by allowing interest at the Default Rate. As used in Section 25.2.3 above,\nthe “worth at the time of award” is computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“Discount Rate”) at the time of\naward plus one percent (1%). If the format or components of the Discount Rate are materially changed, or if the Discount Rate ceases to exist, Landlord shall substitute a\ndiscount rate which is maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or similar financial institution and which is most nearly equivalent to the Discount Rate.\n1.3 Additional Remedies. If any such Tenant Default occurs, Landlord may utilize the remedy described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 (which\nprovides landlord may continue the lease in effect after a tenant’s breach and abandonment and recover Rent as it becomes due, if tenant has the right to sublet or assign subject\nto reasonable limitations). Accordingly, in the event of any Tenant Default and abandonment of the Premises by Tenant, if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease on\naccount of such Tenant Default, then Landlord may from time-to-time, without terminating this Lease, enforce all of its rights and remedies under this Lease, including the right\nto recover all Rent as it becomes due. In the event of the Abandonment of the Premises by Tenant or in the event that Landlord utilizes the remedy described in this Section 25.3\nabove or shall take possession of the Premises pursuant to legal proceeding or pursuant to any notice provided by Law, then if Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as\nprovided above, Landlord may from time to time, without terminating this Lease, either recover all Rent as it becomes due or relet the Premises or any part thereof for the Term\nof this Lease on terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion may deem advisable with the right to make alterations and repairs to the Premises.\nIf Landlord shall elect to so relet, such reletting shall not relieve Tenant of any obligation hereunder, except that the rents received by Landlord from such reletting\nshall be applied as follows: (a) first, to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; (b) second, to the payment of any cost of such\nreletting; (c) third, to the payment of the cost of any alterations and repairs to the Premises; (d) fourth, to the payment of Rent due and unpaid hereunder and (e) the residue, if\nany, shall be held by Landlord and applied to payment of future Rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder. Should that portion of such rents\n- 29 -\nreceived from such reletting during any month, which is applied to the payment of Rent hereunder, be less than the Rent payable during that month by Tenant hereunder, then\nTenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord immediately upon demand therefor by Landlord. Such deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly. Tenant shall also pay to\nLandlord, as soon as ascertained, any costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by Landlord in such reletting or in making such alterations and repairs not covered\nby the rents received from such reletting. During the continuance of a Tenant Default, Landlord shall have the right to market the Premises to potential new tenants and may\nshow the Premises to such potential new tenants during normal business hours.\n1.4 Notice of Default. Tenant hereby acknowledges that default by Tenant hereunder, and Landlord’s election to prepare and serve a Notice of any such default\nhereunder (a “Notice of Default”), will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, and costs in addition to any costs which may be reimbursed to Landlord by\nany provision which may be contained herein relative to the payment of interest or late charges on amounts due hereunder. Accordingly, Landlord shall be entitled to reasonable\nattorneys’ fees and all other costs and expenses incurred in the preparation and service of a Notice of Default and consultations in connection therewith, with respect to which\nLandlord and Tenant agree that Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) is a reasonable minimum sum per such occurrence, whether or not legal action is subsequently commenced in\nconnection with any such default. It is further hereby specifically agreed by and between Landlord and Tenant that any and all such fees and costs shall be deemed Additional\nRent hereunder, and may, at the option of Landlord, be included in any Notice of Default hereunder.\n1.5 Landlord’s Right to Cure. If Tenant should fail to make any payment or perform any of its other obligations hereunder, Landlord, without being under any\nobligation to do so and without thereby waiving such default, may make such payment and/or remedy such other default for the account of Tenant (and enter the Premises for\nsuch purpose): (a) immediately and without notice in the case: (i) of emergency, (ii) of a default by Tenant of its obligations under Section 8.3, Section 15.2 and/or Article 31,\n(iii) where such default unreasonably interferes with any other tenant in the Project, (iv) a failure to satisfy or otherwise discharge any lien, or (v) where such default will result\nin the violation of Law or the cancellation of any insurance policy maintained by Landlord and (b) in any other case if such default continues beyond the applicable notice and\ncure period specified in Section 25.1 above, and thereupon Tenant shall be obligated to, and hereby agrees to pay Landlord, upon demand, all costs, expenses, and\ndisbursements incurred by Landlord in taking such remedial action, together with an amount equal to five percent (5%) thereof for Landlord’s overhead and administrative\nexpenses, and the sum of such costs, together with interest thereon at the rate described in Section 5.3 from the date of Landlord’s payment thereof, shall be deemed Additional\nRent.\n1.6 Waiver of Redemption. Tenant (for itself and all others claiming through Tenant) hereby irrevocably waives and releases its rights to redemption and\nreinstatement under any present or future case law or statutory provision (including, without limitation, Sections 473, 1174 and 1179 of the California Code of Civil Procedure\nand Section 3275 of the California Civil Code) in the event that Tenant is dispossessed from the Premises for any reason.\n1.7 Landlord’s Default. Landlord’s failure to perform or observe any of its obligations under this Lease shall constitute a default by Landlord under this Lease (a\n“Landlord Default”) only if Landlord, or the Holder (defined below) of any Security Instrument (defined below) covering the Premises, fails to perform obligations required of\nLandlord within thirty (30) days after Notice by Tenant to Landlord (and to each Holder pursuant to Section 36.5 below), specifying wherein Landlord has failed to perform\nsuch obligations in reasonable detail; provided, however, that if the nature of Landlord’s obligation is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for performance, then no\nLandlord Default shall occur if Landlord commences performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion (or if any\nHolder of any Security Instrument commences and prosecutes the cure pursuant to Section 36.5 below). In no event shall Tenant be entitled to terminate this Lease by reason of\nany Landlord Default, and Tenant’s remedies shall be limited to an action for monetary damages at law. Without limiting the foregoing, in recognition that Landlord must\nreceive timely payments of Rent and operate the Project, Tenant shall have no right of self-help to perform repairs or any other obligation of Landlord and, except as expressly\nprovided in Articles 23 and 24, shall have no right to withhold, set-off, or abate Rent.\nArticle 26\nNO WAIVER\nAll rights, options and remedies of Landlord contained in this Lease shall be construed and held to be cumulative, and not one of them shall be exclusive of the other,\nand Landlord shall have the right to pursue any one or all of such remedies or any other remedy or relief which may be provided by Law, whether or not stated in this Lease.\nThe waiver by Landlord of any breach of any term, covenant or condition herein contained shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any\nother term, covenant or condition herein contained, nor shall any custom or practice which may grow up between the parties in the administration of the terms hereof be deemed\na waiver of or in any way affect the right of Landlord to insist upon the performance by Tenant in strict accordance with said terms. The subsequent acceptance of Rent\nhereunder by Landlord shall not be\n- 30 -\ndeemed to be a waiver of any preceding breach by Tenant of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease, other than the failure of Tenant to pay the particular Rent so\naccepted, regardless of Landlord’s knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such Rent. No acceptance by Landlord of a lesser sum than the Basic Rent\nand Additional Rent or other sum then due shall be deemed to be other than on account of the earliest installment of such Rent or other amount due, nor shall any endorsement\nor statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to\nLandlord’s right to recover the balance of such installment or other amount or pursue any other remedy provided in this Lease. Without limiting the foregoing, Tenant (for itself\nand all others claiming through Tenant) acknowledges that this Article 26 imparts actual notice to Tenant, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161.1(c),\nthat Landlord’s acceptance of partial payment of Rent shall not constitute a waiver of any rights available under this Lease or at law or equity, including, without limitation, the\nright to recover possession of the Premises.\nArticle 27\nASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING\n1.1 Transfer. Tenant shall not voluntarily or by operation of law: (a) sublease all or any part of the Premises (“Sublease”), (b) assign this Lease (“Assignment”),\nor (c) enter into any other agreement or arrangement: (i) that permits a third party (other than Tenant’s employees and occasional guests) to enter, occupy or use any portion of\nthe Premises or remove any of Tenant’s Personal Property therefrom or (ii) otherwise assigns, transfers, mortgages, pledges, hypothecates, encumbers or permits a lien to attach\nto Tenant’s interest under this Lease or in the Premises (each of the foregoing (a), (b) and (c), a “Transfer”), without first obtaining Landlord’s prior written consent in\naccordance with this Article 27. In addition, for purposes of this Lease a “Transfer” (which shall be subject to the provisions of this Article 27) shall also include the dissolution\nof the entity that constitutes Tenant without its immediate reconstitution. No consent to an assignment, encumbrance or sublease shall constitute a waiver of any provision of\nthis Article 27 or consent to any future assignment, encumbrance or transfer. Any Transfer without Landlord’s prior written consent shall be voidable at Landlord’s election and\nshall constitute a Tenant Default.\n1.2 Transfer Procedure. If Tenant desires to make any Transfer, then at least thirty (30) days prior to the date when Tenant desires the Transfer to be effective\n(“Transfer Date”) Tenant shall give Landlord a Notice (“Transfer Notice”) setting forth: (a) the name, address and business of the person or entity to which the Transfer is\nproposed (“Proposed Transferee”); (b) information (including references) concerning the character, ownership and financial condition of the Proposed Transferee; (c) the\nproposed Transfer Date (which shall not be later than 90 days following the Transfer Notice); (d) any ownership or commercial relationship between Tenant and the Proposed\nTransferee; and (e) the consideration and all other material terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer, all in such detail as Landlord shall reasonably require. If Landlord\nreasonably requests additional detail (including, without limitation, financial statements of the proposed Transferee or a current estoppel certificate from Tenant), the Transfer\nNotice shall not be deemed to have been received until Landlord receives such additional detail, and Landlord may withhold consent to any proposed Transfer until such\ninformation is provided to it.\n1.3 Recapture. Within thirty (30) days of Landlord’s receipt of a Transfer Notice, and all information specified in Section 27.2 above, Landlord may, at its\noption, in its sole and absolute discretion, by Notice to Tenant (“Recapture Notice”), elect to: (a) in the case of a proposed Sublease, sublease the Premises or the portion thereof\nproposed to be sublet by Tenant at a rental rate per square foot equal to the lesser of the per square foot rental rate under this Lease or the proposed Sublease; (b) in the case of a\nproposed Assignment, take an assignment of this Lease upon the same terms as those offered to the proposed assignee; or (c) terminate this Lease in its entirety or as to the\nportion of the Premises subject to the proposed Transfer. Tenant shall have the right, by Notice to Landlord no later than five (5) business days following Landlord’s delivery of\na Recapture Notice, to withdraw the subject Transfer Notice, in which event such Recapture Notice shall have no force or effect. Tenant’s failure to deliver such Notice to\nwithdraw the subject Transfer Notice within such five (5) business day period shall be deemed a waiver of its right to withdraw such Transfer Notice and the parties shall\nproceed pursuant to the Recapture Notice. If Landlord elects to proceed pursuant to clause (a) or (b) above (and Tenant does not timely withdraw the subject Transfer Notice),\nany payment by Landlord to Tenant pursuant to such clause shall not exceed the amount which Tenant would have received pursuant to Section 27.5.2 below if Landlord had\nelected to consent to the proposed Sublease or Assignment. If this Lease shall be terminated with respect to the entire Premises, the Term shall end on the Transfer Date as if\nthat date had been originally fixed in this Lease for the expiration of the Term. If Landlord recaptures only a portion of the Premises, the Rent during the unexpired Term and\nTenant’s Percentage shall be adjusted proportionately based on the Rentable Square Feet remaining in the Premises after such recapture. Tenant shall, at Tenant’s own cost and\nexpense, discharge in full any commissions which may be due and owing as a result of any proposed assignment or subletting, whether or not the Premises (or portion thereof)\nare recaptured pursuant to this Section 27.3 and rented by Landlord to the proposed tenant or any other tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord’s rights set forth in this\nSection 27.3 shall not apply to a Sublease of a portion of the Premises to a party\n- 31 -\nwho is acquiring a business segment located in such subleased portion of the Premises from Tenant or an affiliate of Tenant.\n1.4 Landlord’s Consent; Consent Standards; No Release.\n1.4.1. Unless Landlord elects to exercise any of its rights under Section 27.3 above, Landlord shall, by Notice to Tenant, elect to: (a) consent to such\nproposed Transfer upon the terms and to the Proposed Transferee; or (b) refuse to give its consent to the proposed Transfer. Landlord shall not unreasonably withhold its\nconsent to any Proposed Transfer; provided that, without limiting other situations in which it may be reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any proposed Transfer, it\nshall be deemed reasonable for Landlord to withhold its consent to any proposed Transfer if Landlord determines in its sole discretion that: (i) the Proposed Transferee, in the\ncase of an Assignment of this Lease or a Sublease of more than fifty percent (50%) of the Rentable Square Feet of the Premises, does not have sufficient financial strength or\nstability to perform all obligations under this Lease, and to perform them without any higher risk of default than Tenant; (ii) the intended use of the Premises (or the applicable\nportion thereof) by the Proposed Transferee is inconsistent or incompatible with other uses in the Project; (iii) the intended use of the Premises (or the applicable portion\nthereof) by the Proposed Transferee will require alteration of the Premises; (iv) the intended use of the Premises (or the applicable portion thereof) by the Proposed Transferee\nwill violate this Lease or any Laws governing the Premises or the Project; (v) the Proposed Transferee has the power of eminent domain, is a Governmental Authority or an\nagency or subdivision of a foreign government; (vi) either the Proposed Transferee, or any person which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common\ncontrol with the Proposed Transferee: (A) occupies space in the Project or has negotiated with Landlord or any of its affiliates within the preceding one hundred eighty (180)\ndays (or is currently negotiating with Landlord or any of its affiliates) to lease space in the Project or (B) does not intend to occupy the Premises or the applicable portion\nthereof; (vii) at the time Tenant delivers the Transfer Notice, there exists an uncured Tenant Default; (viii) the proposed Transfer would cause Landlord to be in violation of\nanother lease or agreement to which Landlord is a party or would give an occupant of the Project a right to cancel or modify its lease; (ix) any ground lessor or mortgagee\nwhose consent to such Transfer is required fails to consent thereto; (x) the use of the Premises (or the applicable portion thereof) or the Project by the Proposed Transferee\nwould, in Landlord’s judgment, significantly increase pedestrian traffic in and out of the Project, generate increased loitering in Common Areas, increase security risk, or\nrequire any alterations to the Project to comply with applicable Laws; (xi) the Proposed Transferee would be a competitor to another tenant in the Project in violation of such\nother tenant’s lease; (xii) the Proposed Transferee has been required by any prior landlord, lender or Governmental Authority to take material remedial action in connection\nwith Hazardous Materials contaminating a property, which contamination resulted from Proposed Transferee’s action or omission or use of the property in question; or (xiii) the\nProposed Transferee is subject to a material enforcement order issued by any Governmental Authority in connection with the use, disposal or storage of Hazardous Materials.\n1.4.2. Tenant further agrees that Landlord may condition its consent to any proposed Transfer upon satisfaction of any of the following conditions: (a)\ndelivery to Landlord of a true copy of a fully executed sublease, assignment of lease or other instrument pursuant to which the applicable Transfer is made (“Transfer\nInstrument”); (b) delivery to Landlord of original executed copies (by Tenant and the Transferee (defined below)) of Landlord’s form of Consent to Sublease (in the case of a\nSublease) or Assignment and Assumption of Lease and Consent (in the case of an Assignment) or other instrument under which Landlord grants consent to the applicable\nTransfer (“Consent Instrument”) and (c) receipt by Landlord of all sums and amounts to which Landlord is entitled under Section 27.5 below. Tenant acknowledges and agrees\nthat any Consent Instrument may, without limitation: (i) in the case of a Sublease or Assignment, require the person or entity to which the Transfer is made (“Transferee”) to be\nbound by all of the terms and provisions of this Lease and to perform all of the obligations of Tenant hereunder applicable to the Premises, or the portion thereof that is the\nsubject of the applicable Transfer; (ii) in the case of an Assignment, include waivers by Tenant of all applicable suretyship defenses, including, but not limited to, those\ncontained in Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code; and (iii) in the case of a Sublease: (A) provide that such Sublease is subject and subordinate to this\nLease to all Security Instruments encumbering the Buildings or the Project, (B) require the Transferee to, upon demand by Landlord following the occurrence of any Tenant\nDefault, remit directly to Landlord, all monies payable from such Transferee to Tenant in connection with such Sublease and (C) provide that in the event of termination of this\nLease for any reason, including without limitation a voluntary surrender by Tenant, or in the event of any reentry or repossession of the Premises by Landlord, Landlord may, at\nits option, either: (x) terminate the sublease or (y) take over all of the right, title and interest of Tenant, as sublessor, under such sublease, in which case such sublessee shall\nattorn to Landlord, but that nevertheless Landlord shall not: (1) be liable for any previous act or omission of Tenant under such sublease, (2) be subject to any defense or offset\npreviously accrued in favor of the sublessee against Tenant, or (3) be bound by any previous modification of any sublease made without Landlord’s written consent, or by any\nprevious prepayment by sublessee of more than one month’s rent.\n1.4.3. If Landlord grants its consent to any proposed Transfer described in any Transfer Notice, Tenant may during the thirty (30) days thereafter\nconsummate such Transfer with the Proposed Transferee upon the terms and conditions described in the applicable Transfer Notice; provided, however, that any material\nchange in\n- 32 -\nsuch terms shall be subject to Landlord’s consent as provided in this Article 27. No Assignment or Sublease or other Transfer (whether with or without Landlord’s consent) shall\nrelieve Tenant or any assignee or sublessee from any obligation under this Lease whether or not accrued as of the date of the Assignment or Sublease (and, to the extent such\nTenant is deemed a surety of an assignee, Tenant hereby waives all applicable suretyship defenses, including, but not limited to, those contained in Sections 2787 to 2855,\ninclusive, of the California Civil Code.\n1.5 Landlord’s Costs; Transfer Premiums.\n1.5.1. If Tenant requests Landlord’s consent to a proposed Transfer under the provisions of this Article 27, Tenant shall, upon demand, reimburse all of\nLandlord’s reasonable expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with processing such request for consent, whether or not Landlord grants consent to such\nproposed Transfer.\n1.5.2. If Landlord consents to a Transfer, Tenant shall pay to Landlord fifty percent (50%) of any rent or other consideration realized by Tenant pursuant to\nsuch Transfer in excess of (i) the Rent payable by Tenant under this Lease, (ii) any reasonable tenant improvement allowance or other economic concession (e.g., space\nplanning allowance, moving expenses, free or reduced rent periods, etc.) actually incurred by Tenant in connection with such Transfer, (iii) any reasonable advertising costs and\nbrokerage commissions actually incurred by Tenant in connection with such Transfer, and (iv) any reasonable legal fees actually incurred by Tenant in connection with such\nTransfer.\n1.6 Rights Not Transferable.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 27, (a) any Transfer to an affiliate of Tenant (an entity which is\ncontrolled by, controls, or is under common control with Tenant), (b) any Transfer to an entity which acquires all or substantially all of the assets or interests (partnership, stock\nor other) of Tenant, or (c) any Transfer to an entity which is the resulting entity of a merger or consolidation of Tenant, shall not be deemed a Transfer under this Article 27,\nprovided that (i) in the case of an assignment of this Lease or a sublease of more than fifty percent (50%) of the Rentable Square Feet of the Premises, the financial credit of\nsuch transferee entity is, in Landlord’s reasonable judgment, the same or greater than that of Tenant both as of the Effective Date of this Lease and as of the date of the proposed\ntransfer; (ii) Tenant notifies Landlord of such transfer within thirty (30) days thereof and promptly thereafter supplies Landlord with any documents or information reasonably\nrequested by Landlord regarding such transfer or such affiliate; and (iii) such transfer is not a subterfuge by Tenant or Guarantor to avoid its obligations under this Lease or\notherwise effectuate any “release” by Tenant or Guarantor of such obligations.

With respect to any Security Instrument existing as of the\nCommencement Date, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Holder thereof to enter\n- 33 -\ninto a subornation, non-disturbance and attornment agreement concurrently with the execution of this Lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall have the right to\nsubordinate or cause to be subordinated such ground leases or any such liens to this Lease. In the event that any ground lease or underlying lease terminates for any reason or\nany mortgage or deed of trust is foreclosed or a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure is made for any reason, Tenant shall, notwithstanding any subordination, attorn to and become\nthe tenant of the successor-in-interest to Landlord, at the option of such successor-in-interest to Landlord provided that such successor-in-interest to Landlord agrees to not\ndisturb the tenancy of Tenant pursuant and subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease. Tenant covenants and agrees to execute and deliver, within ten (10) business days\nafter demand by Landlord therefor, any additional commercially reasonable documents evidencing the priority or subordination of this Lease with respect to any such Security\nInstruments.\nArticle 29\nESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE\n1.1 Tenant Estoppel Certificate. Within ten (10) business days following any written request which Landlord may make from time to time, Tenant shall execute\nand deliver to Landlord a statement, in a form substantially similar to the form of Exhibit “E” attached hereto, and incorporated herein by this reference (a “Tenant Estoppel\nCertificate”) certifying: (a) the Commencement Date of this Lease; (b) that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if there have been modifications hereto, that\nthis Lease is in full force and effect, and stating the date and nature of such modifications); (c) the date to which the Rent and other sums payable under this Lease have been\npaid; (d) that to the best of Tenant’s knowledge, there are no then current defaults under this Lease by Landlord except as specified in Tenant’s statement; (e) that Tenant has\nreceived no written notice that there are any then current defaults under this Lease by Tenant except as specified in Tenant’s statement; and (f) such other matters as are\nreasonably included in such statement by Landlord. Landlord and Tenant intend that any statement delivered pursuant to this Article 29 may be relied upon by any mortgagee,\nlessor, beneficiary, purchaser or prospective purchaser of the Buildings or the Project or any interest therein.\n1.2 Failure to Deliver. Tenant’s failure to deliver such statement within such time shall be conclusive upon Tenant: (a) that this Lease is in full force and effect,\nwithout modification except as may be represented by Landlord, (b) that there are no uncured defaults in Landlord’s performance, (c) that not more than one (1) month’s Rent\nhas been paid in advance and (d) that the statements included in the Tenant Estoppel Certificate are true and correct, without exception. Additionally, any such failure to timely\ndeliver a Tenant Estoppel Certificate shall constitute an immediate Tenant Default hereunder.\nArticle 30\nINTENTIONALLY OMITTED\nArticle 31\nSURRENDER OF PREMISES\nUpon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term hereof, Tenant shall peaceably surrender the Premises and all Leasehold Improvements therein, excepting only\nany of the same that are required to be removed in accordance with Section 15.2 above, to Landlord broom-clean, in good order, repair and condition (reasonable wear and tear\nand casualty damage excepted), with all of Tenant’s Personal Property removed and free of any Hazardous Materials (excluding any Hazardous Materials in existence as of the\napplicable Commencement Date except to the extent caused or exacerbated by Tenant), and shall otherwise comply with all of the requirements of Section 15.2 above and\nSection 41.1 below. The voluntary or other surrender of this Lease by Tenant, or a mutual cancellation thereof, shall not work a merger, and shall, at the option of Landlord,\noperate as an assignment to it of any or all subleases or subtenancies. The delivery of keys to any employee of Landlord or to Landlord’s agent or any employee thereof shall not\nbe sufficient to constitute a termination of this Lease or a surrender of the Premises.\nArticle 32\nPERFORMANCE BY TENANT\nAll covenants and agreements to be performed by Tenant under any of the terms of this Lease shall be timely performed by Tenant at Tenant’s sole cost and expense and\nwithout any abatement of Rent except as expressly provided in this Lease. If Tenant shall fail to pay any sum of money owed to any party other than Landlord, for which it is\nliable hereunder, or if Tenant shall fail to timely perform any other act on its part to be performed hereunder Landlord may, without waiving or releasing Tenant from\nobligations of Tenant, but shall not be obligated to, make any such payment or perform any such other act to be made or performed by Tenant pursuant to Section 25.5 above.\n- 34 -\nArticle 33\nPARKING\nBeginning on the Commencement Date, Tenant and Tenant’s business visitors (“Tenant’s Parking Invitees”) shall be entitled to use the number of parking spaces set forth in\nSection 1.8 during the Term, which parking spaces shall be located in the surface parking area of the Project (“Parking Area”). There shall be no direct charge attributable to\nTenant’s use of the Parking Area, other than any taxes imposed by any governmental authority in connection with the renting of parking spaces by Tenant or the use of the\nParking Area by Tenant. Tenant’s continued right to use the Parking Area is conditioned upon Tenant abiding by the Parking Rules and Regulations set forth on Exhibit “G” as\namended from time to time for the orderly operation and use of the Parking Area, including any sticker, parking pass or other identification system established by Landlord,\nTenant’s cooperation in seeing that Tenant’s employees and visitors also comply with the Parking Rules and Regulations and Tenant not being in default under this Lease\n(beyond any applicable notice and cure periods). Landlord specifically reserves the right to change the size, configuration, design, layout and all other aspects of the Parking\nArea at any time and Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord may, from time to time, close-off or restrict access to the Parking Area for purposes of permitting or\nfacilitating any such construction, alteration or improvements; provided, however, in connection with any such access restrictions, the same shall be without incurring any\nliability to Tenant and without any abatement of Rent under this Lease to the extent Landlord provides any reasonably required temporary, alternate parking. Landlord may\ndelegate its responsibilities hereunder to a parking operator in which case such parking operator shall have all the rights of control attributed hereby to Landlord. Any parking\npasses issued to Tenant pursuant to this Article 33 shall be provided to Tenant solely for use by Tenant’s own personnel and such passes may not be transferred, assigned,\nsubleased or otherwise alienated by Tenant without Landlord’s prior approval. Tenant may validate visitor parking by such method or methods as Landlord may establish, at the\nvalidation rate from time to time generally applicable to visitor parking.\nArticle 34\nLIMITATION ON LIABILITY\n1.1 Landlord’s Liability. In consideration of the benefits accruing hereunder, Tenant and all of its successors and assigns covenant and agree that, in the event of\nany actual or alleged failure, breach or default hereunder by Landlord:\n1.1.1.

These covenants and agreements are enforceable by Landlord and the other Landlord Indemnified Parties.\nArticle 35\nCONFIDENTIALITY\nTenant agrees that the terms and conditions of this Lease and any documents or information delivered hereunder are confidential and constitute proprietary information.\nDisclosure of the terms and conditions hereof or any documents or information delivered hereunder could adversely affect the ability of Landlord to negotiate with other tenants\nor potential tenants of the Project.

In the event that Tenant concludes that it is obligated by Law to disclose the terms of this Lease (e.g., pursuant to a filing with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or the NASDAQ), Tenant shall provide written notice to Landlord before any public disclosure, and the parties shall use their\ncommercially reasonable efforts to cause a mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued. The foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures by Tenant\nnecessary to implement the provisions of this Lease or to comply with the accounting and disclosure obligations of the SEC or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. If\nTenant determines that it is required to file this Lease, a summary thereof, or a notification thereof, and/or descriptions related thereto, to comply with the requirements of an\napplicable stock exchange, SEC regulation, or any Governmental Authority, including the SEC, Tenant shall use its best efforts to provide the maximum amount of advance\nwritten notice of any such required disclosure to Landlord with a minimum advance notice period of five (5) business days.

If this Lease specifies a time period for performance of an obligation of such party, that time\nperiod shall be extended by the period of any delay in such party’s performance caused by any of the events of Force Majeure described above.

Such statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles and, if such is the normal\n- 37 -\npractice of Tenant, shall be audited by an independent certified public accountant. All financial statements shall be certified as true and correct by Tenant’s chief financial\nofficer and Tenant agrees that Landlord may share such financial statements with prospective lenders and purchasers of the Property provided that such lenders and purchasers\nexecute a non-disclosure agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Tenant if such financial statements are not publicly available.

For purposes of Section 1938 of the California Civil Code, Landlord hereby discloses to Tenant that the Building Common Areas, Project\nCommon Areas and Premises, as of the date of this Lease, have not been inspected by a Certified Access Specialist (CASp), as that term is defined in California Civil Code\nSection 55.52. In accordance with subsection (e) of Section 1938 of the California Civil Code, Tenant is further notified as follows:\nA Certified Access Specialist (CASp) can inspect the subject premises and determine whether the subject premises comply with all of the\napplicable construction-related accessibility standards under state law. Although state law does not require a CASp inspection of the subject\npremises, the commercial property owner or lessor may not prohibit the lessee or tenant from obtaining a CASp inspection of the subject\npremises for the occupancy or potential occupancy of the lessee or tenant, if requested by the lessee or tenant. The parties shall mutually agree\non the arrangements for the time and manner of the CASp inspection, the payment of the fee for the CASp inspection, and the cost of making\nany repairs necessary to correct violations of construction-related accessibility standards within the premises.\nArticle 37\nSIGNAGE\nLandlord retains absolute control over the exterior appearance of the Buildings and the Project and the exterior appearance of the Premises as viewed from the\nBuilding Common Areas and Project Common Areas. Tenant will not, without Landlord’s prior written consent, install, or permit to be installed, any drapes, furnishings, signs,\nlettering, designs, advertising or any items that will in any way alter the exterior appearance of the Buildings, the Project or the exterior appearance of the Premises as viewed\nfrom the Building Common Areas and Project Common Areas. Any sign, advertising, design, or lettering installed by Tenant shall be considered an Alteration and shall be\nsubject to the provisions of Article 15; provided that Landlord shall have the right to withhold its consent to the same in its sole and absolute discretion. Landlord, at its sole\ncost and expense, shall install suite identification signage bearing Tenant’s name and logo adjacent to the entrance to the Premises. In addition, Tenant, at its sole cost and\nexpense, shall have the exclusive right, without obligation, to have its name (including its logo) displayed on (a) one (1) building-top sign on one of the Buildings, and (b) on\nthe Project’s monument sign, in each case in a location designated by Landlord (collectively, “Tenant’s Signage”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Article\n37. Tenant hereby acknowledges that, as of the Effective Date, Landlord has not received approval from the City of San Diego (or any other authority with jurisdiction over the\nProject) for any exterior signage for the Project and, accordingly, Tenant’s right to any such signage (including, without limitation, Tenant’s Signage set forth above) is\ncontingent on such approval. In addition, the specifications of Tenant’s Signage (including, without limitation, the dimensions and configuration thereof) shall be subject to the\nprior written approval of Landlord,\n- 38 -\nwhich approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided that such specifications are consistent with Landlord’s sign program for the Project and all applicable Laws.

Prior to installation,\nTenant shall deliver to Landlord a drawing depicting the design, size, location, specifications, graphics, materials and colors of Tenant’s Signage, all of which shall be\nconsistent with Landlord’s sign program and the Rules and Regulations. Tenant’s Signage shall be subject to any applicable review and approval by the City of San Diego and\nany other authorities with jurisdiction over the Project, and Tenant shall obtain all applicable permits and authorizations by Governmental Authorities prior to installation of\nTenant’s Signage. After installation, Tenant shall maintain Tenant’s Signage in good condition and repair at all times through the Term. Tenant shall remove Tenant’s Signage\nupon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease and shall repair any damage caused thereby. The maintenance and removal of Tenant’s Signage shall be performed at\nTenant’s sole cost and expense. All signage rights granted to Tenant under this Lease are personal to the original Tenant named herein, and, except in connection with a\nPermitted Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, may not be assigned or transferred without Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent Landlord may withhold in its sole and\nabsolute discretion.\nArticle 38\nEXECUTIVE ORDER 13224\nTenant hereby represents and warrants to Landlord that Tenant is not: (a) in violation of any Anti-Terrorism Law (defined below); (b) conducting any business or\nengaging in any transaction or dealing with any Prohibited Person (defined below), including, without limitation, the making or receiving of any contribution of funds, goods or\nservices to or for the benefit of any Prohibited Person; (c) dealing in, or otherwise engaging in any transaction relating to, any property or interest in property blocked pursuant\nto Executive Order No. 13224; (d) engaging in or conspiring to engage in any transaction that evades or avoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate\nany of the prohibitions set forth in any Anti-Terrorism Law; or (e) a Prohibited Person, nor are any of its partners, members, managers, officers or directors a Prohibited Person.\nAs used herein, “Anti-Terrorism Law” is defined as any Law relating to terrorism, anti-terrorism, money laundering or anti-money laundering activities, including, without\nlimitation, Executive Order No. 13224 and Title 3 of the USA Patriot Act.

Following twenty-four (24) hours’ notice to Landlord and upon receipt of written approval by Landlord (which shall not be unreasonably\nwithheld or delayed), Landlord shall permit Tenant and its agents to enter the applicable Premises up to sixty (60) days prior to the applicable Commencement Date (“Early\nAccess Period”) for the sole purpose of installing, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, its furniture, fixtures, equipment and cabling in the applicable Premises; provided,\nhowever, that in no event shall such early access, regardless of when provided, extend or otherwise affect the Commencement Date. Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, may\nenter the Premises prior to the Early Access Period to conduct indoor air samples, subject to Landlord’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or\ndelayed, and provided that Tenant uses Weis Environmental (or if Weis Environmental is not available, another environmental consultant selected by Tenant, subject to\nLandlord’s reasonable approval) to gather and analyze any such air samples; any such entry by Tenant shall be subject to all other terms and conditions of this Section 41.1. Any\nsuch entry shall be in a manner and upon terms and conditions and at times satisfactory to Landlord’s representative. The foregoing license to enter the Premises prior to the\nCommencement Date is, however, conditioned upon Tenant’s contractors and their subcontractors and employees working in harmony and not interfering with the work being\nperformed by Landlord. If at any time such entry shall cause disharmony or interfere with the work being performed by Landlord, this license may be withdrawn by Landlord\nupon twenty-four (24) hours written notice to Tenant. Tenant shall be liable for any damages caused by Tenant’s activities at the Premises. Such license is further conditioned\nupon the compliance by Tenant’s contractors with all requirements imposed by Landlord on third party contractors, including, without limitation, the maintenance by Tenant\nand its contractors and subcontractors of workers’ compensation and public liability and property damage insurance in amounts and with companies and on forms satisfactory to\nLandlord, with certificates of such insurance being furnished to Landlord prior to proceeding with any such entry. The entry shall be deemed to be under all of the provisions of\nthis Lease except as expressly set forth in this Section 41.1. During the Early Access Period, Tenant shall have no obligation to pay Basic Rent, Operating Expenses or Real\nProperty Taxes. Landlord shall not be liable in any way for any injury, loss or damage which may occur to any such work being performed by Tenant, the same being solely at\nTenant’s risk. All costs and expenses in connection with or arising out of the performance of any work by Tenant during such early entry shall be borne by Tenant, and all\npayments therefor shall be made by Tenant promptly as they become due. Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and\npolicies governing its work. Tenant shall defend, indemnify and hold Landlord and its members, agents, employees, partners, and their respective employees, partners, officers,\ndirectors, agents, representatives, successors and assigns, harmless from and against any and all suits, claims, actions, losses, costs, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable\nattorneys’ fees and claims for workers’ compensation) to the extent arising out of or in connection with any and all work by Tenant or on Tenant’s behalf, during such early\nentry (including, but not limited to, claims for breach of warranty, personal injury or property damage). Landlord shall have the right, in Landlord’s sole and absolute discretion,\nto settle, compromise, or otherwise dispose of any and all suits, claims, and actions against any of the indemnified parties arising out of or in connection with the work\nperformed by Tenant during any early entry.

Tenant hereby acknowledges receipt of the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment dated August 26, 2020, prepared by\nPartner Engineering and Science, Inc. regarding the Project (“Original Phase I Assessment”); a copy of the summary of the Original Phase I Assessment is attached hereto as\nExhibit “H”. The Original Phase I Assessment identifies a controlled recognized environmental condition that affects Premises A and Premises B (the “CREC”). Tenant may\nelect for Landlord to remediate the CREC by delivering Landlord written notice thereof any time before Landlord commences the Tenant Improvements (a “Remediation\nNotice”). If Tenant elects for Landlord to remediate the CREC pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Landlord may, at Landlord’s sole cost, either (a) install a vapor\nintrusion mitigation system and a sub-slab depressurization system as identified in the letter dated April 22, 2021 from Weis Environmental or (b) remove the\n- 40 -\nsolvents and volatile compounds identified in the CREC from the soils of the Premises, (as applicable, the “Remediation Work”). The Original Phase I Assessment shall serve\nas the “baseline” for determining the environmental condition of the Project prior to Tenant’s occupancy thereof. In addition to the surrender obligations set forth elsewhere in\nthis Lease (including, without limitation, Section 15.2 and Article 31), upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant, at its sole cost and expense, shall (a)\ncause a Phase I environmental assessment (or similar non-invasive assessment) of the Project (“Phase I Surrender Assessment”) to be performed and deliver the results thereof\nto Landlord no later than thirty (30) days following such expiration or earlier termination (but in no event shall the Phase I Surrender Assessment be dated more than ten (10)\ndays prior to such expiration or earlier termination); and (b) if and to the extent recommended by the Phase I Surrender Assessment and consented to by Landlord in writing,\ncause a Phase II environmental assessment (or similar additional assessment) of the Project (“Phase II Surrender Assessment”) to be performed and deliver the results thereof to\nLandlord no later than thirty (30) days following the date of the Phase I Surrender Assessment. In addition, Landlord shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to\nhire, or to cause Tenant to hire, an environmental consultant to conduct a physical inspection of the Project (“Environmental Inspection”) upon the expiration or earlier\ntermination of this Lease, which inspection shall be at Tenant’s sole cost and expense. The Phase I Surrender Assessment and any Phase II Surrender Assessment and/or\nEnvironmental Inspection, as the same compare to the Original Phase I Assessment, shall be used to, among other things, determine the extent of Tenant’s compliance (or\nnoncompliance) with Section 8.3 above.\n1.3 Generator. Tenant shall have the right to install one (1) standalone emergency generator serving the Premises (“Generator”) in a location reasonably\napproved by Landlord.

The installation of the Generator shall\nbe deemed an Alteration subject to the terms and conditions of Article 15 above.\n1.4 Security System. Tenant shall have the right to install an integrated security system within the Premises (“Security System”).

Tenant shall have the non-exclusive right to install on the roof of the Buildings, at its sole cost and\nexpense but at no charge due to Landlord, one (1) satellite dish or one (1) antenna, together with related cables and appurtenances for Tenant’s data transmission network,\nprovided that (i) the dish or antenna, all appurtenant equipment, and all connecting wires and cables on the roof and within the Building risers shall be depicted on plans and\nspecifications showing the size and configuration thereof and such plans and specifications shall be delivered to Landlord for its prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably\nwithheld or delayed; (ii) any such installation shall be completed in full compliance with any and all rules established for the location of communications installations\nestablished by Landlord, all applicable laws, municipal or governmental rules, regulations, permits and approvals, any covenants, conditions or restrictions governing the\nPremises and/or the Project in effect at the time Tenant desires to install such equipment, and any applicable owners’ association rules, regulations, permits and approvals; (iii)\nany such installation and the use thereof shall not interfere with the operation of any third party communications installations existing on the roof of the Buildings at the time\nTenant installs its equipment; and (iv) any such installation shall not be visible from view from the ground level or any other lot within the Project to Landlord’s reasonable\nsatisfaction. Subject to the foregoing, Tenant shall have the right to vertical access to the roof at no additional cost for the purpose of installing and maintaining its rooftop\ninstallation. Tenant shall pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the installation, maintenance and, upon the expiration of the Term or any earlier termination of\nthis Lease, the removal of all of Tenant’s equipment, wires and cables from the roof and all other portions of the Buildings.

In addition to the Base Rent specified in this Lease, commencing as of the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to\nLandlord as Additional Rent for the Demised Premises, in each full or partial Lease Year during the Term, an amount equal to the Operating Expenses\nfor a particular Lease Year (the “Annual Operating Expense Adjustment”). Landlord and Tenant acknowledge and agree that so long as Tenant is\nleasing all of the rentable square footage of the Building, Tenant shall be responsible for 100% of the Operating Expenses incurred by Landlord, but that\nsuch amount shall be reduced proportionately in the event of any assignment or sublease permitted by this Lease or other reduction of the Demised\nPremises as may be agreed by Landlord or Tenant.

Additionally,\nLandlord shall estimate the Annual Operating Expense Adjustment annually, and written notice thereof shall be given to Tenant prior to the beginning of\neach calendar year. In no event may any such Annual Operating Expense Adjustment exceed, by more five percent (5%), the actual\n11\nOperating Expenses for the immediately preceding Lease Year. Tenant shall pay to Landlord each month, at the same time the Base Rent is due, an\namount equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the estimated Annual Operating Expense Adjustment. If Landlord does not furnish any such Annual Operating\nExpense Adjustment subsequent to the commencement thereof, then until the first day of the second month following the month in which such estimate\nis furnished to Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on the first day of each month an amount equal to the monthly sum payable by Tenant to Landlord\nunder this Section in respect of the last month of the preceding Lease Year, and after such estimate is furnished to Tenant, Landlord shall refund Tenant\nany overpayment or if there is a deficiency, Tenant shall pay any deficient amount to Landlord thirty (30) days after demand therefor.\n(E) Audit. Tenant, upon notice given at any time, may elect to have Tenant’s designated representative (in such notice) examine such\nof Landlord’s books and records (collectively “Records”) as are reasonably relevant to review Operating Expenses. “Records” include sales tax reports\nand sales tax returns, receipts, bank and check books and records supporting data maintained by Landlord and related to Operating Expenses. Tenant’s\nrepresentative shall be permitted to examine the Records at the office of Landlord or Landlord’s managing agent at such time or times during normal\nbusiness hours as Landlord shall reasonably designate and Tenant shall be entitled, at its expense, to make copies of Records reasonably relevant to the\nOperating Expenses for the Lease Year in question. Tenant and Tenant’s employees, accountants and agents shall treat all Records as confidential, and,\nupon request by Landlord, shall confirm such confidentiality obligation in writing prior to such examination. In no event shall the preceding sentence be\ndeemed to limit Tenant’s rights of discovery and disclosure in any action or proceeding, or be construed so as to prohibit Tenant from complying with the\ndirective of any court or arbitrator. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date on which the Records are made available to Tenant in response\nto a request by Tenant, Tenant may send a notice (“Tenant’s Statement”) to Landlord that Tenant disagrees with the applicable Annual Operating\nExpense Adjustment, specifying in reasonable detail the basis for Tenant’s disagreement and the amount of the Operating Expenses that Landlord claims\nis due from Tenant for such Lease Year. Landlord and Tenant shall thereafter meet and attempt in good faith to resolve such disagreement. If the parties\nfail to resolve such disagreement within ninety (90) days after the date when Tenant gives Tenant’s Statement to Landlord, then either Landlord or\nTenant may notify the other that such party desires to have such disagreement determined by arbitration in accordance with the terms of this Lease.\nPending resolution of such disagreement, (A) Tenant shall pay the undisputed portion(s) of the Annual Operating Expense Adjustment in accordance\nwith the Annual Operating Expense Adjustment in question and (B) Tenant shall not be deemed to be in default under this Lease for withholding\npayment of the disputed portion(s). If the arbitrator shall determine that any disputed portion of such Annual Operating Expense Adjustment was\nrequired to be paid by Tenant,\n12\nTenant shall pay to Landlord within, thirty (30) days after such determination, such disputed amount. If it is determined as a result of any examination by\nTenant of Landlord’s Records that the sums payable by Tenant in respect of Operating Expenses for any Lease Year exceeded the actual payment of\nOperating Expenses for such Lease Year by more than five percent (5%), then, in addition to amounts payable by Landlord, Landlord shall reimburse\nTenant for the out-of-pocket cost of Tenant’s examination. Landlord shall retain all Records relating to payment of Operating Expenses until Tenant no\nlonger has the right to examine such Records. Tenant’s payment of any Operating Expenses shall not preclude Tenant from later disputing the\ncorrectness of any Operating Expenses within the time periods set forth above. The foregoing right of audit shall only apply to Operating Expenses paid\nby Tenant during any twelve-month period for up to three (3) years prior to the date of the Tenant’s audit demand. Landlord shall not be required to\nretain any Records for any period exceeding three (3) years.\n10. SECURITY DEPOSIT.

At the request of Tenant, Landlord shall, from time to time, promptly inform Tenant of the progress of\nLandlord’s restoration work and of the estimated date of completion of the same and otherwise consult with Tenant. Notwithstanding the generality of\nthe foregoing, at Tenant’s election, provided that Landlord assigns to Tenant all insurance proceeds payable to Landlord under the property insurance\npolicy, Tenant may elect to restore the portion of the Demised Premises so damaged or destroyed to the same condition, as nearly as possible, as existed\nprior to such Damage Event in good faith, and with promptness and diligence. In such event, Landlord shall cooperate with Tenant in all ways necessary\nto expedite the restoration. From the time of any damage or destruction to the Building until the earlier to occur of (i) the date when Landlord redelivers\npossession of the Demised Premises (or the applicable portion thereof) to Tenant in the condition required above or (ii) or the date when Tenant resumes\noperations of its business in such portion of the Demised Premises, Rent shall be reduced in the proportion to the Rentable Area of the portion of the\nDemised Premises that is not usable or reasonably accessible by Tenant for the conduct of its business.\nNotwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, if (a) the Demised Premises are totally damaged or are rendered wholly untenantable,\n(b) if a reputable licensed engineer estimates that the period of time to restore the Demised Premises exceeds three hundred sixty (360) days from the\ndate of such fire or other casualty or (c) there are less than twelve (12) months remaining in the Term and Tenant elects not to exercise its option to\nextend the Tenn, or no such option is remaining, then in either of such events, Tenant may, not later than ninety (90) days following the date of the\ndamage, give Landlord a written notice terminating this Lease. If this Lease is so terminated, (a) the Tenn shall expire upon the date set forth in such\nnotice, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days after such notice is given, and Tenant shall vacate the Demised Premises and surrender the same to\nLandlord no later than the date set forth in the notice, (b) Tenant’s liability for rent hereunder shall cease as of the date of the damage, (c) any prepaid\nRent for any period after the date of the damage shall be refunded by Landlord to Tenant, and (d) Landlord shall be entitled to collect all insurance\nproceeds of policies held by Landlord or Tenant providing coverage for alterations and other improvements to the Demised Premises. Landlord shall\nretain such proceeds from Tenant’s insurance only to the extent that Landlord performed or paid for such alterations and improvements, whether by\ncontribution, offset or otherwise, and the balance of such proceeds, if any, shall be paid to Tenant.\n27. CONDEMNATION.\n25\n(A) Complete Taking. In the event the entire Demised Premises are taken in Condemnation Proceedings, Tenant may terminate this\nLease upon written notice without further liability under this Lease, except for such obligations as may be due as of the date of termination, and Landlord\nshall refund any unearned rent to Tenant.\n(B) Partial Taking. In the event any part of the Demised Premises, or all or part of rights-of-way adjoining or approaches to the\nDemised Premises, are taken in Condemnation Proceedings (other than widening of adjacent highways that do not affect access to the Demised Premises\nor loss of any merchandise display area or a taking of a portion of the parking lot that leaves a sufficient number of parking spaces remaining for the\noperation of Tenant’s business and to meet governmental requirements, which shall be considered a “de minimus” taking) so that in the reasonable\nbusiness judgment of Tenant the Demised Premises remaining would be unsatisfactory for Tenant’s business operation, Tenant may terminate this Lease\nupon written notice to Landlord without further liability under this Lease, except for such obligations as may be due as of the date of termination, and\nLandlord shall refund any unearned rent to Tenant. Should Tenant elect to retain that portion of the Demised Premises not taken, Landlord shall\npromptly and with due diligence restore the remaining Demised Premises to as close to their condition as existed prior to the taking as is feasible.\nCommencing on the date Tenant relinquishes possession of that portion of the Demised Premises taken and during the remainder of the Term, rent shall\nbe reduced (i) in proportion to the amount of the Demised Premises lost, except that there shall be no reduction for a de minimus taking, or (ii) if Tenant\nshall elect, in proportion to the effect of the loss of such area on Tenant’s business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should Tenant be required to\nrelinquish possession of the entire Demised Premises during the period of restoration, Rent shall abate completely from the time Tenant relinquishes\npossession of the entire Demised Premises until the first to occur of (i) sixty (60) days after the restoration is Complete and exclusive possession of the\nDemised Premises is delivered to Tenant, or (ii) the date on which Tenant reopens its business to the public.\n(C) Condemnation Proceedings.

(the “Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to\ncreate and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company’s pay-for-performance\ncompensation philosophy. The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has therefore adopted this policy, which provides for the\nrecoupment of certain executive compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial\nstatements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws (this “Policy”). This Policy\nis designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the rules promulgated\nthereunder, and the listing standards of the national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nADMINISTRATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board (the “Compensation\nCommittee”). Any determinations made by the Compensation Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nCOVERED EXECUTIVES\nThis Policy applies to the Company’s current and former executive officers (as determined by the Compensation Committee in\naccordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act, the rules promulgated thereunder, and the listing standards of the national securities\nexchange on which the Company’s securities are listed) and such other senior executives or employees who may from time to time be deemed\nsubject to this Policy by the Compensation Committee (collectively, the “Covered Executives”). This Policy shall be binding and enforceable\nagainst all Covered Executives.\nRECOUPMENT; ACCOUNTING RESTATEMENT\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statements due to the Company’s\nmaterial noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement (i) to\ncorrect an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or (ii) that would result\nin a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (each an “Accounting\nRestatement”), the Compensation Committee will reasonably promptly require reimbursement or forfeiture of the Overpayment (as defined\nbelow) received by any Covered Executive (x) after beginning service as a Covered Executive, (y) who served as a Covered Executive at any\ntime during the performance period for the applicable Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined below), and (z) during the three (3)\ncompleted fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement and any\ntransition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) within or immediately following those three (3) completed fiscal\nyears.\nINCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION\nFor purposes of this Policy, “Incentive-Based Compensation” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly\nor in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure, including, but not limited to: (i) non-equity incentive plan awards that are\nearned solely or in part by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance goal; (ii) bonuses paid from a bonus pool, where the size of the\npool is determined solely or in part by satisfying a financial reporting measure performance goal; (iii) other cash awards based on satisfaction\nof a financial reporting measure performance goal; (iv) restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights, and\nperformance share units that are granted or vest solely or in part based on satisfaction of a financial reporting measure performance goal; and\n(v) proceeds from the sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan that were granted or vested solely or in part based on satisfaction of a\nfinancial reporting measure performance goal.\nCompensation that would not be considered Incentive-Based Compensation includes, but is not limited to: (i) salaries; (ii) bonuses paid\nsolely based on satisfaction of subjective standards, such as demonstrating leadership, and/or completion of a specified employment period;\n(iii) non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely based on satisfaction of strategic or operational measures; (iv) wholly time-based equity\nawards; and (v) discretionary bonuses or other compensation that is not paid from a bonus pool that is determined by satisfying a financial\nreporting measure performance goal.\nA financial reporting measure is: (i) any measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in\npreparing financial statements, or any measure derived wholly or in part from such measure, such as revenues, EBITDA, or net income or (ii)\nstock price and total shareholder return. Financial reporting measures include, but are not limited to: revenues; net income; operating income;\nprofitability of one or more reportable segments; financial ratios (e.g., accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover rates); net assets or\nnet asset value per share; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; funds from operations and adjusted funds from\noperations; liquidity measures (e.g., working capital, operating cash flow); return measures (e.g., return on invested capital, return on assets);\nearnings measures (e.g., earnings per share); sales per square foot or same store sales, where sales is subject to an accounting restatement;\nrevenue per user, or average revenue per user, where revenue is subject to an accounting restatement; cost per employee, where cost is subject\nto an accounting restatement; any of such financial reporting measures relative to a peer group, where the Company’s financial reporting\nmeasure is subject to an accounting restatement; and tax basis income.\nOVERPAYMENT: AMOUNT SUBJECT TO RECOVERY\nThe amount to be recovered will be the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation received that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based\nCompensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, and must be computed without\nregard to any taxes paid (the “Overpayment”). Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “received” in the Company’s fiscal period during\nwhich the financial reporting measure specified in the incentive-based compensation award is attained, even if the vesting, payment or grant of\nthe incentive-based compensation occurs after the end of that period.\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously awarded\ncompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the Accounting Restatement, the amount must be\nbased on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the\nIncentive-Based Compensation was received, and the Company must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate\nand provide such documentation to the exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\n2\nMETHOD OF RECOUPMENT\nThe Compensation Committee will determine, in its sole discretion, the method or methods for recouping any Overpayment hereunder\nwhich may include, without limitation:\n• requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-Based Compensation previously paid;\n• seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other disposition of any equity-based awards\ngranted as Incentive-Based Compensation;\n• offsetting any or all of the Overpayment from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the Covered Executive;\n• cancelling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\n• taking any other remedial or recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\nLIMITATION ON RECOVERY; NO ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS\nThe right to recovery will be limited to Overpayments received during the three (3) completed fiscal years prior to the date on which\nthe Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal\nyear) within or immediately following those three (3) completed fiscal years. In no event shall the Company be required to award Covered\nExecutives an additional payment if the restated or accurate financial results would have resulted in a higher Incentive-Based Compensation\npayment.\nNO INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any incorrectly awarded Incentive-Based Compensation.\nINTERPRETATION\nThe Compensation Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate,\nor advisable for the administration of this Policy. It is intended that this Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the\nrequirements of Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the applicable rules or standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission or\nany national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\nEFFECTIVE DATE\nThis Policy shall be effective as of the date it is adopted by the Board (the “Effective Date”) and shall apply to Incentive-Based\nCompensation (including Incentive-Based Compensation granted pursuant to arrangements existing prior to the Effective Date).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this Policy shall only apply to Incentive-Based Compensation received (as determined pursuant to this Policy)\non or after the effective date of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5608.\nAMENDMENT; TERMINATION\n3\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion. The Board may terminate this Policy at any time.\nOTHER RECOUPMENT RIGHTS\nThe Board intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Compensation Committee may require that any\nemployment or service agreement, cash-based bonus plan or program, equity award agreement, or similar agreement entered into on or after\nthe adoption of this Policy shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Executive to agree to abide by the\nterms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment\nthat may be available to the Company pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity award agreement,\ncash-based bonus plan or program, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\nIMPRACTICABILITY\nThe Compensation Committee shall recover any Overpayment in accordance with this Policy except to the extent that the\nCompensation Committee determines such recovery would be impracticable because:\n(A) The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered;\n(B) Recovery would violate home country law of the Company where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; or\n(C) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of\nthe Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\nSUCCESSORS\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or\nother legal representatives.\n4"
