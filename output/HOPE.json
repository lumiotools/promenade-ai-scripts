(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: HOPE), the holding company of Bank of Hope (the “Bank”), today reported unaudited financial results for its third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income totaled $24.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share. This compares with net income of $25.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2024. Excluding notable items (1) , net income for the 2024 third quarter was $25.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share. \n\n“We are pleased to see a higher level of productivity from our banking teams, along with the continued success of our core deposit gathering initiatives. Quarter-over-quarter, customer deposit growth was a robust 11% annualized, supporting loan growth and offsetting a planned reduction in brokered deposits,” said Kevin S. Kim, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “In the 2024 third quarter, loans receivable grew 2% on an annualized basis, marking a turn-around in our loan growth trend. Additionally, more than two-thirds of the net growth in noninterest bearing demand deposits this quarter came from small business accounts. \n\n“Regulatory risk-based capital ratios for Hope Bancorp are the highest since our merger with Wilshire Bancorp in 2016. As of September 30, 2024, our total capital ratio was a strong 14.8%, and our tangible equity ratio was a robust 10.1%,” continued Kim. \n\n“The success of our balance sheet management has resulted in high levels of capital, ample liquidity, and a lower loan-to-deposit ratio, positioning us well to increase our market share, add new client relationships, and generate profitable growth as economic conditions and loan demand improve in the coming year,” said Kim. \n\n“We are excited about our pending merger with Territorial Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ: TBNK), the stock holding company of Territorial Savings Bank. We believe this compelling combination will strengthen the Territorial franchise for the long term, providing many advantages for customers and employees as part of a larger organization with greater resources, enhanced technology platforms, and an expanded array of banking products and services.” \n\n_____________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Net income, excluding merger-related expenses, restructuring-related charges and the FDIC special assessment (also referred to collectively as the “notable items”), is a non-GAAP financial measure. Quantitative reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the accompanying financial information on Table Pages 10 and 11.   \n---|---  \n  \n** Operating Results for the 2024 Third Quarter **\n\n**_Net interest income and net interest margin._ ** Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the 2024 third quarter totaled $104.8 million. This compares with net interest income before provision for credit losses of $105.9 million in the immediately preceding second quarter. Interest income was $235.1 million in the third quarter of 2024, up from $232.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. Growth in interest income was offset by increased interest expense, which was $130.3 million in the third quarter, compared with $126.7 million in the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense reflects the change in average total deposit costs, which increased five basis points to 3.44% for the 2024 third quarter, up from 3.39% in the immediately preceding second quarter. End-of-period total deposit costs decreased nine basis points to 3.34% as of September 30, 2024, from 3.43% as of June 30, 2024, indicating an inflection point in deposit costs by deposit type. \n\nNet interest margin for the 2024 third quarter was 2.55%, down seven basis points from 2.62% in the 2024 second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter change in net interest margin reflects a higher balance and cost of average interest bearing deposits, as well as the change in average loan yields, partially offset by a higher balance and yield earned on average interest earning cash and deposits at other banks, and a lower balance and lower rate paid on average borrowings. \n\n**_Noninterest income._ ** Noninterest income for the 2024 third quarter increased to $11.8 million, up 7% from $11.1 million in the immediately preceding second quarter. The Company recorded net gains on the sale of SBA loans of $2.7 million in the 2024 third quarter, compared with $2.0 million in the immediately preceding second quarter. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company sold $41.4 million of SBA loans, compared with $29.8 million in the second quarter of 2024. Other noninterest income in the 2024 third quarter included a $403,000 gain from bank owned life insurance, as well as a $326,000 net loss on sales of securities available for sale, as the Company repositioned a portion of its lower-yielding investment securities. \n\n**_Noninterest expense._ ** Noninterest expense for the 2024 third quarter was $81.3 million, compared with $81.0 million in the immediately preceding second quarter, and down 6% year-over-year from $86.8 million in the 2023 third quarter. Excluding notable items (2) , which were primarily merger-related costs, noninterest expense for the 2024 third quarter was $79.8 million, compared with $79.1 million for the 2024 second quarter, and down 8% year-over-year from $86.3 million for the 2023 third quarter. Salaries and employee benefits expense for the 2024 third quarter was $44.2 million, up by $53,000 and essentially stable compared with $44.1 million in the 2024 second quarter. Year-over-year, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 13% from $51.0 million in the 2023 third quarter, reflecting the benefits of a restructuring executed in the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Tax rate._ ** The year-to-date effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 26.6%, compared with the year-to-date effective tax rate of 25.7% for the same period of 2023. For the full year 2024, the Company expects the effective tax rate to be approximately 26%. \n\n_____________________________________ \n\n(2)  |  Notable items included $1.2 million of merger-related expenses and $197,000 of restructuring-related costs for the 2024 third quarter, $1.6 million of merger-related expenses, $576,000 of restructuring-related costs, and a $309,000 reversal of an accrual related to the FDIC special assessment for the 2024 second quarter, and $500,000 of restructuring related costs for the 2023 third quarter, all on a pre-tax basis. Noninterest expense, excluding notable items, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Quantitative reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the accompanying financial information on Table Pages 10 and 11.   \n---|---  \n  \n** Balance Sheet Summary **\n\n**_Cash and investment securities._ ** At September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $680.9 million, compared with $654.0 million at June 30, 2024, and $2.50 billion at September 30, 2023. The year-over-year change in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflected the payoff of the Company’s Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) borrowings in March and April of 2024. Investment securities totaled $2.18 billion at September 30, 2024, $2.17 billion at June 30, 2024, and $2.26 billion at September 30, 2023. \n\n**_Loans._ ** Gross loans of $13.64 billion at September 30, 2024, were up $8.4 million from $13.64 billion at June 30, 2024. Loans receivable, which excludes loans held for sale, grew $51.0 million quarter-over-quarter, or up 2% annualized. Quarter-over-quarter, commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans increased, partially offset by a decrease in commercial real estate loans. The Company sold $41.4 million of SBA loans in the third quarter of 2024. \n\nThe following table sets forth the loan portfolio composition at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: \n\n_(dollars in thousands) (unaudited)_ |  **9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Balance** |  **Percentage** |  **Balance** |  **Percentage** |  **Balance** |  **Percentage**  \nCommercial real estate (“CRE”) loans  |  $  |  8,630,757  |  63.3  |  %  |  $  |  8,679,515  |  63.6  |  %  |  $  |  8,972,886  |  62.6  |  %   \nCommercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans  |  3,901,368  |  28.6  |  %  |  3,854,284  |  28.3  |  %  |  4,450,341  |  31.1  |  %   \nResidential mortgage and other loans  |  1,085,863  |  7.9  |  %  |  1,033,203  |  7.6  |  %  |  882,966  |  6.2  |  %   \nLoans receivable  |  13,617,988  |  99.8  |  %  |  13,567,002  |  99.5  |  %  |  14,306,193  |  99.9  |  %   \nLoans held for sale  |  25,714  |  0.2  |  %  |  68,316  |  0.5  |  %  |  19,502  |  0.1  |  %   \nGross loans  |  $  |  13,643,702  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  13,635,318  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  14,325,695  |  100.0  |  %   \n  \n**_Deposits._ ** Total deposits amounted to $14.73 billion at September 30, 2024, up $18.0 million from $14.71 billion at June 30, 2024. During the 2024 third quarter, robust growth in customer deposits of 11% annualized more than offset a planned reduction of brokered deposits. Noninterest bearing demand deposits grew $51.8 million quarter-over-quarter to $3.72 billion at September 30, 2024, and money market and interest bearing demand deposits increased $105.4 million quarter-over-quarter to $5.01 billion. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company reduced brokered deposits by $351.5 million from June 30, 2024. \n\nThe following table sets forth the deposit composition at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: \n\n_(dollars in thousands) (unaudited)_ |  **9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Balance** |  **Percentage** |  **Balance** |  **Percentage** |  **Balance** |  **Percentage**  \nNoninterest bearing demand deposits  |  $  |  3,722,985  |  25.3  |  %  |  $  |  3,671,192  |  24.9  |  %  |  $  |  4,249,788  |  27.0  |  %   \nMoney market, interest bearing demand, and savings deposits  |  5,013,305  |  34.0  |  %  |  4,907,860  |  33.4  |  %  |  4,855,683  |  30.9  |  %   \nTime deposits  |  5,993,208  |  40.7  |  %  |  6,132,419  |  41.7  |  %  |  6,634,388  |  42.1  |  %   \nTotal deposits  |  $  |  14,729,498  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  14,711,471  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  15,739,859  |  100.0  |  %   \nGross loan-to-deposit ratio  |  92.6  |  %  |  92.7  |  %  |  91.0  |  %   \n  \nOn October 1, 2024, the Bank completed a branch purchase and assumption agreement whereby PromiseOne Bank acquired the deposits and other assets associated with Bank of Hope’s Annandale and Centreville branches in Virginia. As of transaction close, deposits at these two branches totaled approximately $129.4 million. \n\n**_Borrowings._ ** Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings decreased to $100.0 million at September 30, 2024, down from $170.0 million at June 30, 2024, and $1.80 billion at September 30, 2023. The year-over-year change primarily reflected the payoff of the Company’s BTFP borrowings in March and April 2024. \n\n** Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses **\n\n**_Nonperforming assets._ ** Nonperforming assets were $103.8 million, or 0.60% of total assets, at September 30, 2024, compared with $67.3 million, or 0.39% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, and $61.7 million, or 0.31% of total assets, at September 30, 2023. The increase was due to the migration of one relationship that was placed on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024, following loan maturities. This relationship consists of three commercial real estate loans that are well-secured by properties in primary locations with minimal to no loss expected. \n\nThe following table sets forth the components of nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: \n\n_(dollars in thousands) (unaudited)_ |  **9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \nLoans on nonaccrual status (1) |  $  |  103,602  |  $  |  67,003  |  $  |  39,081   \nAccruing delinquent loans past due 90 days or more  |  226  |  273  |  21,579   \nTotal nonperforming loans  |  103,828  |  67,276  |  60,660   \nOther real estate owned  |  —  |  —  |  1,043   \nTotal nonperforming assets  |  $  |  103,828  |  $  |  67,276  |  $  |  61,703   \nNonperforming assets/total assets  |  0.60 %  |  0.39 %  |  0.31 %   \n  \n_____________________________________\n\n(1)  |  Excludes delinquent SBA loans that are guaranteed and currently in liquidation totaling $13.1 million, $11.2 million and $12.1 million at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Net charge offs and provision for credit losses._ ** The Company recorded net charge offs of $5.7 million in the 2024 third quarter, equivalent to 0.17%, annualized, of average loans. This compares with net charge offs of $4.4 million, or 0.13%, annualized, of average loans in the immediately preceding second quarter. Net charge off levels continue to be moderate. \n\nThe following table sets forth net charge offs and annualized net charge off ratios for the three months ended September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: \n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n_(dollars in thousands) (unaudited)_ |  **9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \nNet charge offs  |  $  |  5,749  |  $  |  4,439  |  $  |  30,987   \nAnnualized net charge offs/average loans  |  0.17  |  %  |  0.13  |  %  |  0.85  |  %   \n  \nFor the 2024 third quarter, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $3.3 million. This compares with a provision for credit losses of $1.4 million in the immediately preceding second quarter. \n\n**_Allowance for credit losses._ ** The allowance for credit losses totaled $153.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared with $156.0 million at June 30, 2024. The allowance coverage ratio was 1.13% of loans receivable at September 30, 2024, compared with 1.15% at June 30, 2024. The change in allowance coverage reflects the positive impact from improved macroeconomic variables, notably the CRE price index, in the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, partially offset by increased qualitative and individually evaluated loan reserves. \n\nThe following table sets forth the allowance for credit losses and the coverage ratios at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: \n\n_(dollars in thousands) (unaudited)_ |  **9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \nAllowance for credit losses  |  $  |  153,270  |  $  |  156,019  |  $  |  158,809   \nAllowance for credit losses/loans receivable  |  1.13  |  %  |  1.15  |  %  |  1.11  |  %   \n  \n** Capital **\n\nThe Company’s capital ratios are strong and all regulatory risk-based capital ratios expanded quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. At September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all regulatory capital requirements generally required to meet the definition of a “well-capitalized” financial institution. The following table sets forth the capital ratios for the Company at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: \n\n_(unaudited)_ |  **9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023** |  **Minimum Guideline** **for “Well-Capitalized”**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio  |  13.06%  |  12.70%  |  11.67%  |  6.50%   \nTier 1 Capital Ratio  |  13.78%  |  13.40%  |  12.32%  |  8.00%   \nTotal Capital Ratio  |  14.80%  |  14.41%  |  13.23%  |  10.00%   \nLeverage Ratio  |  11.61%  |  11.61%  |  9.83%  |  5.00%   \n  \nAt September 30, 2024, total stockholders’ equity was $2.17 billion, or $17.97 per common share, compared with $2.11 billion, or $17.49 per common share, at June 30, 2024. Tangible common equity (“TCE”) per share (4) was $14.10 at September 30, 2024, compared with $13.61 at June 30, 2024, and the TCE ratio (3) was 10.08% at September 30, 2024, up 36 basis points from 9.72% at June 30, 2024. \n\nThe following table sets forth the TCE per share and the TCE ratio at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023: \n\n_(unaudited)_ |  **9/30/2024** |  **6/30/2024** |  **9/30/2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTCE per share  |  $14.10  |  $13.61  |  $13.01   \nTCE ratio  |  10.08%  |  9.72%  |  7.96%   \n  \n_____________________________________ \n\n(3) |  TCE per share and TCE ratio are non-GAAP financial measures.

(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: HOPE), the holding company of Bank of Hope (the “Bank”), today reported unaudited financial results for its second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, net income totaled $25.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share. This compares with net income of $25.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share, in the first quarter of 2024. Excluding notable items (1) , net income for the 2024 second quarter was $26.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted common share. \n\n“During the 2024 second quarter, our net interest margin expanded, our operating expenses decreased, and our return on assets improved, compared with the 2024 first quarter,” said Kevin S. Kim, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “These highlights reflect continued progress towards improving our financial performance following our strategic reorganization in the fourth quarter of last year. \n\n“Quarter-over-quarter, total deposits were essentially stable with growth in noninterest bearing demand deposits and other customer deposits largely offsetting a planned reduction in brokered time deposits. Our cost of total deposits increased by only three basis points this quarter, a sharp deceleration from the quarterly increases over the past two years. Gross loans decreased modestly quarter-over-quarter as elevated payoffs and paydowns offset growing production volumes. Given the improved conditions in the secondary markets, we resumed SBA loan sales during the second quarter. Nonperforming assets of $67.3 million at June 30, 2024, decreased 37% from March 31, 2024, and our overall credit quality remains stable. \n\n“Following the signing of the definitive merger agreement with Territorial Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ: TBNK), the stock holding company of Territorial Savings Bank, on April 26, 2024, we have been diligently planning for a smooth integration,” continued Kim. “The addition of Territorial’s stable and low-cost deposit base will enhance our deposit franchise. Territorial’s residential mortgage loans, with their excellent asset quality, will accelerate the diversification of our loan portfolio. Combined, we will be the largest regional bank catering to multi-ethnic customers with full-service branches across the continental United States and Hawai‘i.” \n\n____________________ \n\n(1) |  Net income, excluding merger-related expenses, restructuring-related charges and the FDIC special assessment (also referred to collectively as the “notable items”), is a non-GAAP financial measure. Quantitative reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the accompanying financial information on Table Pages 10 and 11.   \n---|---  \n  \n** Operating Results for the 2024 Second Quarter **\n\n**_Net interest income._ ** Net interest income before provision for credit losses for the 2024 second quarter totaled $105.9 million, compared with $115.0 million in the immediately preceding first quarter, a decrease of $9.1 million, or 8%, quarter-over-quarter. Approximately $4.0 million of the quarter-over-quarter decrease was attributable to the net impact of the Company’s payoff of its Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”) borrowings that matured in late March 2024 and early April 2024, which the Company paid off with interest earning cash. \n\n**_Net interest margin expansion._ ** Net interest margin for the 2024 second quarter expanded to 2.62%, up seven basis points from 2.55% in the 2024 first quarter, largely reflecting a favorable earning asset mix shift. The 2024 second quarter yield on average earning assets was 5.76%, unchanged from the first quarter of 2024. The cost of average interest bearing liabilities was 4.55% in the second quarter of 2024, up only two basis points from 4.53% in the preceding first quarter. \n\n**_Cost of deposits._ ** The quarter-over-quarter rate of change in deposit costs substantially slowed. The average cost of total deposits for the 2024 second quarter was 3.39%, an increase of three basis points from 3.36% in the preceding first quarter. This rate of change compares favorably with the 21 basis point quarter-over-quarter increase in the average cost of total deposits in the 2024 first quarter, and with the quarterly rates of change experienced in 2023 and 2022. \n\n**_Noninterest income._ ** Noninterest income for the 2024 second quarter increased to $11.1 million, up 34% from $8.3 million in the immediately preceding first quarter, primarily reflecting $2.0 million of net gains on the sale of SBA loans. During the 2024 second quarter, the Company resumed sales of the guaranteed portion of its SBA 7(a) loans. There were no such SBA gains on sale in the immediately preceding first quarter. \n\n**_Noninterest expense._ ** Noninterest expense for the 2024 second quarter decreased 5% to $81.0 million from $84.8 million in the immediately preceding first quarter, and was down 7% year-over-year from $87.2 million in the 2023 second quarter. The Company continues to manage expenses closely following its restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2024. Excluding notable items (2) , noninterest expense for the 2024 second quarter was $79.1 million, down 4% compared with $82.4 million for the 2024 first quarter, and down 9% year-over-year. Noninterest expense for the 2024 second quarter included notable items comprising $1.6 million of merger-related expenses, $576,000 of restructuring-related costs, and a $309,000 reversal of accrual related to the FDIC special assessment, all on a pre-tax basis. For the 2024 first quarter, noninterest expense included notable items comprising $1.0 million of merger-related expenses, an incremental accrual of $1.0 million for the FDIC special assessment, and $402,000 of restructuring-related costs, all on a pre-tax basis. \n\nSalaries and employee benefits expense for the 2024 second quarter was $44.1 million, a 7% quarter-over-quarter decrease from $47.6 million in the 2024 first quarter, which included seasonally higher items such as payroll tax accruals. Year-over-year, salaries and employee benefits expense decreased 16% from $52.3 million in the 2023 second quarter, reflecting the results of the restructuring. \n\n**_Tax rate._ ** The year-to-date effective tax rate for the first half of 2024 was 27.4%, compared with the year-to-date effective tax rate of 26.0% for the first half of 2023. For the full year 2024, the Company expects the effective tax rate to be approximately 26%. \n\n____________________ \n\n(2) |  Noninterest expense, excluding merger-related expenses, restructuring-related charges and the FDIC special assessment (also referred to collectively as the “notable items”), is a non-GAAP financial measure. Quantitative reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in the accompanying financial information on Table Pages 10 and 11.   \n---|---  \n  \n** Balance Sheet Summary **\n\n**_Cash and investment securities._ ** At June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $654.0 million, compared with $1.19 billion at March 31, 2024, and $2.30 billion at June 30, 2023. The linked-quarter and year-over-year changes in cash and cash equivalents primarily reflected the payoff of the Company’s BTFP borrowings in March and April of 2024. Investment securities totaled $2.17 billion at June 30, 2024, $2.28 billion at March 31, 2024, and $2.19 billion at June 30, 2023. \n\n**_Loans._ ** Gross loans of $13.64 billion at June 30, 2024, decreased $86.6 million, or less than 1%, from $13.72 billion at March 31, 2024. During the 2024 second quarter, the Company sold $29.8 million of the guaranteed portion of its SBA 7(a) loans held for sale. Quarter-over-quarter, commercial and industrial loans decreased, reflecting elevated payoffs and paydowns. This was partially offset by continued strong growth in residential mortgage loans and essentially stable commercial real estate loan balances. \n\nThe following table sets forth the loan portfolio composition at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023: \n\n_(dollars in thousands) (unaudited)_ |  **6/30/2024** |  **3/31/2024** |  **6/30/2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Balance** |  **Percentage** |  **Balance** |  **Percentage** |  **Balance** |  **Percentage**  \nCommercial real estate (“CRE”) loans  |  $  |  8,679,515  |  63.6  |  %  |  $  |  8,707,673  |  63.5  |  %  |  $  |  9,192,160  |  61.7  |  %   \nCommercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans  |  3,854,284  |  28.3  |  %  |  4,041,063  |  29.4  |  %  |  4,805,126  |  32.2  |  %   \nResidential mortgage and other loans  |  1,033,203  |  7.6  |  %  |  970,442  |  7.1  |  %  |  867,524  |  5.8  |  %   \nLoans receivable  |  13,567,002  |  99.5  |  %  |  13,719,178  |  100.0  |  %  |  14,864,810  |  99.7  |  %   \nLoans held for sale  |  68,316  |  0.5  |  %  |  2,763  |  —  |  %  |  49,246  |  0.3  |  %   \nGross loans  |  $  |  13,635,318  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  13,721,941  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  14,914,056  |  100.0  |  %   \n  \n**_Deposits._ ** Total deposits were essentially stable quarter-over-quarter, totaling $14.71 billion at June 30, 2024, compared with $14.75 billion at March 31, 2024, reflecting growth in customer deposits that largely offset planned reductions of brokered time deposits. Noninterest bearing demand deposits grew 1% quarter-over-quarter to $3.67 billion at June 30, 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company reduced brokered time deposits by $92.1 million, or 8% from March 31, 2024. \n\nThe following table sets forth the deposit composition at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, and June 30, 2023: \n\n_(dollars in thousands) (unaudited)_ |  **6/30/2024** |  **3/31/2024** |  **6/30/2023**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Balance** |  **Percentage** |  **Balance** |  **Percentage** |  **Balance** |  **Percentage**  \nNoninterest bearing demand deposits  |  $  |  3,671,192  |  24.9  |  %  |  $  |  3,652,592  |  24.7  |  %  |  $  |  4,229,247  |  27.1  |  %   \nMoney market, interest bearing demand, and savings deposits  |  4,907,860  |  33.4  |  %  |  5,313,064  |  36.0  |  %  |  4,413,079  |  28.2  |  %   \nTime deposits  |  6,132,419  |  41.7  |  %  |  5,787,761  |  39.3  |  %  |  6,977,026  |  44.7  |  %   \nTotal deposits  |  $  |  14,711,471  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  14,753,417  |  100.0  |  %  |  $  |  15,619,352  |  100.0  |  %   \nGross loan-to-deposit ratio  |  92.7  |  %  |  93.0  |  %  |  95.5  |  %   \n  \n**_Borrowings._ ** Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings totaled $170.0 million at June 30, 2024, $795.6 million at March 31, 2024, and $2.26 billion at June 30, 2023.

In cases where investment discretion is shared by more than one institution, care is generally taken to prevent double-counting, but there is always the exception. Another cause of double-counting is a company name change for the 13F filer where the holdings are accounted for under both filer names.  \n**Short Interest** - A large short interest amount affects the institutional ownership amount considerably because all shares that have been sold short appear as holdings in two separate portfolios. One institution has lent its shares to a short seller, while the same shares have been purchased by another reporting institution. Consequently, the institutional ownership percentage reflected in the 13-F filings is overstated as a percentage of total shares outstanding.  \n**A gap between 'as of' dates** - In the case where gaps between the 'as of' dates of the holdings and the shares outstanding arise, the percentage owned could be skewed due to a sharp increase/decrease in shares out. Again, this case doesn’t come up very often but the results are unavoidable.   \n**Other possible reasons:** a) An overlap occurs amongst reporting institutions; b) The 13F filing includes holdings other than common stock issues; c) Mutual fund money is co-advised and incorrectly reported by multiple institutions. \n"
